In July 1992, he filed a complaint with the Red Cross's EEO, contending that his supervisor, Eugene Burke, had attempted to terminate his employment without following Red Cross's \"progressive discipline\" policies.  He stated that Burke's conduct had \"many parallels to injustices that were racially motivated.\"   An investigation revealed that Burke had failed to follow the proper procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with military reductions, increased automation, budget cuts and increased costs, the Red Cross in July 1993 began decreasing its SAF services abroad, including the elimination of 56 Station Managers and Assistant Station Managers.  To facilitate the staff reduction, the Red Cross accelerated the assignment expiration dates of mobile SAF staff who had been overseas for more than five years.  They were notified that their assignments would end in June 1994, and were given the option of resigning and receiving a severance package or applying for a stateside position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Chinneth was among those notified.  Without applying for any stateside positions, he gave a letter of resignation in May 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He sued the Red Cross, asserting claims for retaliation and retaliatory discharge in violation of Title VII's \"opposition clause,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-3(a), and breach of contract.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Red Cross on each.  Chinneth timely appeals only the retaliation claim, contending that the Red Cross retaliated against him for filing the complaint against Burke by giving him a \"provisional\" rating on his July 1, 1992 to June 30, 1993 work performance evaluation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the grant of summary judgment.

Because he felt that Burke would not be fair to him, Chinneth declined to be reviewed in March 1993.  Richard Sanders, who replaced Burke as Chinneth's supervisor, finally prepared Chinneth's evaluation for July 1, 1992 to June 30, 1993.  Using a four-category rating system then in use, he rated Chinneth \"fully successful.\"   Kay Walton, Sanders' immediate superior, converted Chinneth's evaluation (and all others prepared under the old system) to the newly adopted five-category rating system, resulting in a \"provisional\" rating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chinneth contends that his performance evaluation was retaliatory.

See Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"671501\"><a href=\"/opinion/671501/barbara-l-steiner-v-showboat-operating-company-dba-showboat-hotel/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1459</span></a></span>, 1465 n. 6 (9th Cir.1994) (transfer from night to day shift \"barely--if at all--characterizable as 'adverse' employment action\" when it did not involve a demotion, a worse job or any additional responsibilities), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></span> (1995).  Chinneth produced no evidence of harm from the failure to provide the performance review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in Steiner, the record indicates clearly that the Red Cross's failure to provide the evaluation was remedial, not retaliatory.  See id. at 1465.   Burke was then still Chinneth's supervisor and in light of the complaint, the Red Cross sought to avoid additional conflict between the two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has Chinneth established that his eventual receipt of the provisional rating was adverse employment action.  The record does not support his contention that it prevented him from obtaining another position within the Red Cross.  In a letter on March 28, 1994, Walton told Chinneth that he could either resign or apply for a stateside position.  Sanders reiterated these options in a letter of April 25, 1994.  It is undisputed that at these times Chinneth's rating had increased to \"commendable\" and that, instead of applying for a stateside position, he elected to resign.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He produced no evidence of harm from his performance evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This repeated encouragement to apply for stateside positions leads us to reject also the contention that this case falls within the \"unusual circumstances\" in which failure to apply for a position does not vitiate a Title VII action when the employer's discriminatory practices deterred the employee from applying.  Yartzoff v. Thomas, 809 F.2d at 1374.
