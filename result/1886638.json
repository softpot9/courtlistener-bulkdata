Gen., for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before CHARLES CARROLL, and HENDRY and SWANN, JJ.</p>\n<p>PER CURIAM.</p>\n<p>The appellant John Lee Taylor cashed four checks, on June 27 and 31, July 13 and 18, 1969, for $95, $40, $97 and $75 respectively. The checks bore the printed names of Robert J. Erwin and Mildred R. Erwin. The signature thereon of Robert J. Erwin was forged. The name of the payee in each instance was James Jackson.</p>\n<p>In each of four informations the appellant was charged with (1) forgery, (2) uttering a forged instrument, and (3) buying, receiving or aiding in the concealment of stolen property. Tried before the court on the four informations, the appellant-defendant was acquitted of the charges of forgery and uttering a forged instrument, and was found guilty of \"buying, receiving or aiding in the concealment of stolen property, well-knowing the same to be stolen,\" with four five-year sentences imposed. The defendant appealed therefrom.</p>\n<p>An essential element of the offense of uttering a forged instrument, of which the defendant was acquitted, was knowledge by him that the instrument was forged. His acquittal of that offense necessarily resulted from failure of proof of such knowledge, since it was disclosed that the checks were forged and that the defendant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*427</span> had cashed them. Likewise, an essential element of the offense of buying or receiving stolen property of which the defendant was found guilty was knowledge on his part that the property was stolen. On this record his acquittal of the former offense and conviction of the latter were inconsistent.</p>\n<p>In Franklin v.

The owner of the check forms testified that in the month prior to that in which the first check was cashed he had discovered that the checks were missing, but that he did not know they had been stolen until they were returned to him by the bank after having been cashed.</p>\n<p>Possession by the defendant of the checks, if stolen, was not sufficient to charge him with having received them with knowledge of their stolen character.

The oblique application given thereto with reference to the latter offense is that it is a circumstance \"which may be considered as showing a tendency toward guilt.\" King v. State, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3384701\"><a href=\"/opinion/3392259/king-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fla.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3384701\"><a href=\"/opinion/3392259/king-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span>. Therefore, if the times involved here are regarded as having that proximity for which the checks, in the hands of the defendant, would be said to constitute recently stolen property, that circumstance \"showing a tendency toward guilt\" was not sufficient to satisfy the burden of the state to prove the element of knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. On consideration of the record and briefs we hold that the evidence was insufficient to establish by the required quantum of proof the essential element of knowledge, with reference to the offense of which the appellant was convicted.
