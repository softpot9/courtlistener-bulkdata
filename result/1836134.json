Premiums were always computed and accepted on an average annual basis according to the value data reflected <span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> in late monthly reports, which premiums were computed and adjusted at the end of the policy year. At the time of the fire loss of insured's packing shed on October 18, 1967, the last report filed prior thereto was for the month of June, 1967.</p>\n<p>A reading of Clauses 11 and 12 as reflected in the District Court opinion, when taken into consideration with the long-continued acceptance of consistently late filings of the monthly value reports and annual year-end adjusted premiums, leads me to conclude that the decision of the District Court is harsh and unremitting as a matter of law, in the absence of a jury's evaluation of the equitable grounds alleged to support insured's claim. Clause 12 should be read in connection with the contemporaneous annual practice of the insurer continually accepting without objection late monthly value reports over the period of several years along with the annual adjusted premiums, thus apparently lulling the insured into believing its coverage was on an annual value basis rather than a monthly basis, since its premiums were annually adjusted to conform to late value reports.</p>\n<p>Though the literal letter of the policy and of the nonwaiver provision in the monthly report forms are to the contrary, the related yearly conduct of the parties gave rise to contemporaneous factual considerations which entitled petitioner to a jury determination as to whether a waiver and estoppel had occurred \u0097 along with whether under such circumstances the insurer had in fact been prejudiced by Petitioner's late filings.</p>\n<p>See 18 Fla.Jur., Insurance, \u00a7 409; Columbia Fire Insurance Company v.
