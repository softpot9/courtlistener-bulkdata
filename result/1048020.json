Willis, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, for the Appellee, State of Tennessee.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        On April 7, 2005, a Sumner County grand jury indicted the Petitioner for twelve counts\nof sexual exploitation of a minor. On December 5, 2005, the Petitioner pled guilty to ten\ncounts of sexual exploitation of a minor, and the trial court entered an agreed to sentence of\nten years, suspended after the service of 120 days. In his petition, the Petitioner asserts his\nprobation was revoked in 2006, and he was sentenced to work release. The petition further\nasserts that, in January 2010, the Petitioner was ordered to the custody of the Department of\nCorrection.\n\f        On November 30, 2010, the Petitioner, who is imprisoned at the South Central\nCorrectional Facility, filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus relief in which he claimed his\nguilty pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered, the plea agreement was illegal\nbecause it violated his double jeopardy protections, and that he received the ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The State filed a motion to dismiss the petition, arguing the petition\nfailed to state a cognizable claim for writ of habeas corpus. The habeas corpus court granted\nthe State\u2019s motion, and the Petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal. The State filed this Rule\n20 motion, seeking our dismissal of the appeal.\n\n        In Tennessee, \u201c[a]ny person imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, under any pretense\nwhatsoever, except [those held under federal authority], may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to\ninquire into the cause of such imprisonment and restraint.\u201d Church v. State, 987 S.W.2d 855, 857\n(Tenn. Crim. App. 1998) (citing State ex rel. Newsom v. Henderson, 424 S.W.2d 186, 189 (Tenn.\n1968)). The grounds upon which a writ of habeas corpus may be issued are very narrow.\nMcLaney v. Bell, 59 S.W.3d 90, 92 (Tenn. 2001). A writ of habeas corpus is available only\nwhen it appears from the face of the judgment or record that either the convicting court was\nwithout jurisdiction to convict or sentence the petitioner, or the petitioner\u2019s sentence has\nexpired. Archer v. State, 851 S.W.2d 157, 164 (Tenn. 1993); Potts v. State, 833 S.W.2d 60,\n62 (Tenn. 1992). In other words, habeas corpus relief may only be sought when the judgment\nis void, not merely voidable. Taylor v. State, 995 S.W.2d 78, 83 (Tenn. 1999). The petitioner\nhas the burden of establishing either a void judgment or an illegal confinement by a\npreponderance of the evidence. Passarella v. State, 891 S.W.2d 619, 627 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1994). A trial court may summarily dismiss a petition for writ of habeas corpus without the\nappointment of a lawyer and without an evidentiary hearing if there is nothing on the face of\nthe judgment to indicate that the convictions addressed therein are void. See Passarella v.\nState, 891 S.W.2d 619 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994).\n\n        On appeal, the Petitioner contends: (1) that his multiple convictions for sexual\nexploitation of a minor violate his double jeopardy protections; (2) his guilty pleas were the\nresult of ineffective assistance of counsel; and (3) he is being denied a parole hearing.\n\n        We conclude that none of these claims render the Petitioner\u2019s judgments void on their\nface or prove his sentence has expired. We have previously stated that an allegation of double\njeopardy does not render a conviction void, but merely voidable. Ricky Lynn Hill v. Parker,\nWarden, No. W2010-01423-CCA-R3-HC, 2011 WL 287343, at *4 (Tenn. Crim. App., at\nJackson, Jan. 24, 2011) (citations omitted), no Tenn. R. App. P. 11 application filed.\nFurthermore, we note that the Petitioner\u2019s claims regarding the ineffectiveness of counsel and\nthe knowing and voluntary nature of his pleas would, at best, render his judgments voidable,\nnot void; therefore, such allegations are not cognizable claims for habeas corpus relief. See\nPassarella v. State, 891 S.W.2d 619, 627 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994); Walter D. Starnes v. Tony\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fParker, Warden, No. W2006-01634-CCA-R3-HC, 2006 WL 3613603, at *2 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp., at Jackson, Dec. 8, 2006). Finally, the Petitioner\u2019s allegation that he is being denied a\nparole hearing also does not entitle him to habeas corpus relief. See Michael Hooper v. Steven\nDotson, Warden, No. W2007-02098-CCA-R3-HC, 2008 WL 3892036, at *3 (Tenn. Crim.\nApp., at Jackson, Aug. 22, 2008) (citations omitted).\n\n       The Petitioner has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his\nconvictions are void or that his term of imprisonment has expired. Accordingly, the State\u2019s\nmotion is granted. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed in accordance with Rule 20,\nRules of the Court of Criminal Appeals.\n\n\n                                                    ___________________________________\n                                                    ROBERT W.
