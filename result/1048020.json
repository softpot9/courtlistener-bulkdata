On December 5, 2005, the Petitioner pled guilty to ten\ncounts of sexual exploitation of a minor, and the trial court entered an agreed to sentence of\nten years, suspended after the service of 120 days. In his petition, the Petitioner asserts his\nprobation was revoked in 2006, and he was sentenced to work release. The petition further\nasserts that, in January 2010, the Petitioner was ordered to the custody of the Department of\nCorrection.\n\f        On November 30, 2010, the Petitioner, who is imprisoned at the South Central\nCorrectional Facility, filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus relief in which he claimed his\nguilty pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered, the plea agreement was illegal\nbecause it violated his double jeopardy protections, and that he received the ineffective\nassistance of counsel. The State filed a motion to dismiss the petition, arguing the petition\nfailed to state a cognizable claim for writ of habeas corpus. The habeas corpus court granted\nthe State\u2019s motion, and the Petitioner filed a timely notice of appeal. The State filed this Rule\n20 motion, seeking our dismissal of the appeal.\n\n        In Tennessee, \u201c[a]ny person imprisoned or restrained of his liberty, under any pretense\nwhatsoever, except [those held under federal authority], may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus to\ninquire into the cause of such imprisonment and restraint.\u201d Church v.
