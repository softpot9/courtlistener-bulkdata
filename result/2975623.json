Plaintiff Lamar Jones Bey is an inmate at Alger Maximum\n\nCorrectional Facility. Proceeding pro se, he filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against correctional\n\nofficer Kelly Johnson and grievance coordinator Wayne Trierweiler. When this case first came\n\nbefore our circuit, we reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Jones Bey\u2019s suit because he had not\n\nexhausted all of his administrative remedies and remanded for the district court to dismiss the case\n\nwithout prejudice until after exhaustion had been completed. Jones Bey v. Johnson, 407 F.3d 801\n\n(6th Cir. 2004). Later, in Jones v. Bock, 127 S.Ct. 910 (2007), the Supreme Court held that under\n\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPLRA\u201d), courts should not dismiss prisoner complaints\n\nin their entirety when the litigant presents both exhausted and unexhausted claims. In accordance\n\n\n       *\n        The Honorable William O. Bertelsman, United States District Judge for the Eastern District\nof Kentucky, sitting by designation.\n\fNo. 03-2331\nJones Bey v. Johnson\n\nwith Jones, we now reach the merits of Jones Bey\u2019s exhausted claims and AFFIRM the district\n\ncourt.\n\n\n\n                                               FACTS\n\n         Jones Bey alleges that in October 2001, Johnson arbitrarily took away his yard time. He then\n\nfiled a grievance. In response to the grievance, Johnson allegedly came to Jones Bey\u2019s cell and said,\n\n\u201cYou like to write grievances, huh? You know me and the counselor are related, I\u2019m going to see\n\nif I can have him put some pressure on you to break you up from that habit.\u201d Later, Johnson\n\nallegedly shook down Jones Bey\u2019s cell, desecrating several Islamic religious books. Johnson also\n\ntold Jones Bey that \u201cwe don\u2019t like Niggers or Muslims up here.\u201d\n\n         In December 2001, Jones Bey asserts that Johnson placed handcuffs on him too tightly,\n\nwhich caused the loss of blood circulation. Jones Bey maintains that Johnson then pulled on the\n\nhandcuffs, causing him to strike the food slot, resulting in pain and swelling to his wrists. He alleges\n\nthat Johnson then deliberately falsified a misconduct report to cover up the incident.\n\n         Jones Bey was found not guilty of the misconduct charge. In response, Johnson then said to\n\nhim \u201cYou\u2019re dead! And I\u2019m still going to get your ticket free time!\u201d Johnson then ordered a shake-\n\ndown of Jones Bey\u2019s cell. Jones Bey also alleges that Johnson later stopped by his cell and said,\n\n\u201cAsshole, I\u2019m still going to get your Nigger ass!\u201d\n\n         Jones Bey attempted to file a grievance against Johnson, but grievance coordinator\n\nTrierweiler rejected the grievance because it was unclear. Trierweiler then rejected a second\n\n\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fNo. 03-2331\nJones Bey v. Johnson\n\ngrievance because it was already grieved and a third grievance because the issue was not grievable.\n\nJones Bey filed a grievance against Trierweiler, but it was also denied.\n\n                                              ANALYSIS\n\n        We originally directed the dismissal of Jones Bey\u2019s complaint in its entirety because the\n\nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement had not been satisfied, since his complaint contained both exhausted\n\nand unexhausted claims. However, as this case was remanded due to the decision in Jones v. Bock,\n\n127 S.Ct. at 925, we now analyze the merits of Jones Bey\u2019s exhausted complaints.\n\n        In order to state a claim under the Eighth Amendment, Jones Bey must prove both objective\n\nand subjective elements of cruel and unusual punishment. Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 702-\n\n03 (6th Cir. 2001). Although an injury need not be severe, it must amount to a more than a de\n\nminimus use of force against the prisoner. Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1992).\n\nFurthermore, Jones Bey must prove that Johnson acted in a manner that was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and\n\n\u201cwanton.\u201d Parrish v. Johnson, 800 F.2d 600, 604 (6th Cir. 1986). In addition, \u201cthe good faith use\n\nof physical force in pursuit of valid penological or institutional goals will rarely, if ever, violate the\n\nEighth Amendment.\u201d Id.\n\n        Jones Bey contends the injuries to his wrist that he suffered during the handcuffing incident\n\nconstitute a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. During the incident, he claims that his hands\n\nwere cuffed too tightly and mashed against the food slot on his cell. Although the Eighth\n\nAmendment does not require a serious injury, Jones Bey\u2019s injuries were so slight that, even if\n\nproven, they constitute a de minimus violation. We have found that a prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment\n\nrights were not violated in similar situations. See, e.g., Corsetti v. Tessmer, 41 Fed. Appx. 753, 2002\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fNo. 03-2331\nJones Bey v. Johnson\n\nWL 1379033, at *2 (6th Cir. June 25, 2002) (minor bruises and small cuts are de minimus\n\nviolations).   Furthermore, Jones Bey cannot state a claim for violation of his Eighth Amendment\n\nrights based on Johnson\u2019s use of racial slurs and other derogatory language. The occasional use of\n\nracial slurs, \u201calthough unprofessional and reprehensible, does not rise to the level of constitutional\n\nmagnitude.\u201d Id. (citing Torres v. Oakland County, 758 F.2d 147, 152 (6th Cir. 1985)); see also Ivey\n\nv. Wilson, 832 F.2d 950, 954 (6th Cir. 1987).\n\n       The district court also correctly found that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nGovernment officials are entitled to qualified immunity in civil suits when they are engaged in\n\ndiscretionary acts \u201cwhich do not violate clearly established law of which a reasonable person would\n\nhave known.\u201d Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 701z (6th Cir. 2001). We engage in a two-part\n\ninquiry to determine if Johnson and Trierweiler are entitled to qualified immunity. First, Jones Bey\n\nmust allege sufficient facts that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated a constitutionally protected right.\n\nIf so, then we must determine if the violated right was clearly established. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S.\n\n194, 201 (2001). If no constitutional rights have been violated, the inquiry ends with step one, and\n\nthe officers are entitled to immunity. Id. As noted above, the defendants did not violate Jones Bey\u2019s\n\nconstitutional rights; thus, they are entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n       Jones Bey also argues that the defendants violated his First Amendment rights by retaliating\n\nagainst him for filing a grievance against Johnson. As we originally held, these claims were\n\ncorrectly dismissed without prejudice because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                        NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PUBLICATION\n                                File Name: 07a0684n.06\n                               Filed: September 21, 2007\n\n                                           No. 03-2331\n\n                          UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                               FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n\nLAMAR WILLIAM JONES BEY,                                )\n                                                        )\n       Plaintiff-Appellant,                             )\n                                                        )\nv.                                                      )    ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED\n                                                        )    STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR\n                                                        )    THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF\nKELLY JOHNSON and WAYNE                                 )    MICHIGAN\nTRIERWEILER,                                            )\n                                                        )\n       Defendants-Appellees.                            )\n\n\nBefore: SILER and CLAY, Circuit Judges; BERTELSMAN,* District Judge.\n\n       SILER, Circuit Judge.

In addition, \u201cthe good faith use\n\nof physical force in pursuit of valid penological or institutional goals will rarely, if ever, violate the\n\nEighth Amendment.\u201d Id.\n\n        Jones Bey contends the injuries to his wrist that he suffered during the handcuffing incident\n\nconstitute a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights. During the incident, he claims that his hands\n\nwere cuffed too tightly and mashed against the food slot on his cell. Although the Eighth\n\nAmendment does not require a serious injury, Jones Bey\u2019s injuries were so slight that, even if\n\nproven, they constitute a de minimus violation. We have found that a prisoner\u2019s Eighth Amendment\n\nrights were not violated in similar situations. See, e.g., Corsetti v. Tessmer, 41 Fed. Appx. 753, 2002\n\n                                                  -3-\n\fNo. 03-2331\nJones Bey v. Johnson\n\nWL 1379033, at *2 (6th Cir. June 25, 2002) (minor bruises and small cuts are de minimus\n\nviolations).   Furthermore, Jones Bey cannot state a claim for violation of his Eighth Amendment\n\nrights based on Johnson\u2019s use of racial slurs and other derogatory language. The occasional use of\n\nracial slurs, \u201calthough unprofessional and reprehensible, does not rise to the level of constitutional\n\nmagnitude.\u201d Id. (citing Torres v.

We engage in a two-part\n\ninquiry to determine if Johnson and Trierweiler are entitled to qualified immunity. First, Jones Bey\n\nmust allege sufficient facts that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated a constitutionally protected right.\n\nIf so, then we must determine if the violated right was clearly established.

If no constitutional rights have been violated, the inquiry ends with step one, and\n\nthe officers are entitled to immunity. Id. As noted above, the defendants did not violate Jones Bey\u2019s\n\nconstitutional rights; thus, they are entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n       Jones Bey also argues that the defendants violated his First Amendment rights by retaliating\n\nagainst him for filing a grievance against Johnson. As we originally held, these claims were\n\ncorrectly dismissed without prejudice because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
