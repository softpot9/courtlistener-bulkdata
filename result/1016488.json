In these motions, Riley\n\nattacked his life sentence pursuant to a jury conviction for\n\nconspiracy to distribute powder and crack cocaine (count one).1\n\nRiley raised six claims of ineffective assistance in the district\n\ncourt, each of which was denied.        On appeal, he raises three of\n\nthose claims, alleging counsel was ineffective because: Ground\n\nThree, counsel failed to object to the admission of a gun admitted\n\nat trial; Ground Five, counsel failed to object to a sentencing\n\nenhancement for a leadership role in the offense; and, Ground Six,\n\ncounsel failed to argue that his sentence was erroneous under\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).        The district court\n\ndenied relief on all the claims, dismissed Riley\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion,\n\nand denied his motion to reconsider.         Thereafter, however, the\n\ndistrict court granted Riley a certificate of appealability on\n\nGround Six.\n\n          We   previously   denied   Riley\u2019s    motion   to   expand   the\n\ncertificate of appealability to include Grounds Three and Five, but\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      This court previously affirmed Riley\u2019s conviction for count\none, but remanded for resentencing.

Washington, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004), Riley\n\nargues that the lawyer who represented him at resentencing rendered\n\nineffective assistance by failing to adequately argue that Apprendi\n\nprohibited the judge from basing his sentence on facts not found by\n\nthe jury.         To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, Riley\n\nmust       show   (1)   \u201cthat    counsel\u2019s   representation     fell    below    an\n\nobjective standard of reasonableness,\u201d Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668, 688 (1984), and (2) \u201cthat there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the\n\nresult of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d id. at 694.\n\nEven if in the wake of Apprendi it would have been objectively\n\nunreasonable for counsel to fail to object to judicial fact-finding\n\nat sentencing, Riley cannot prevail on his ineffective assistance\n\nclaim because his counsel did argue that all facts relevant to his\n\nsentence should have been proven to the jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt rather than found by a preponderance of the evidence by the\n\njudge.       J.A. 157-59.       Accordingly, we affirm the denial of relief\n\non Ground Six.
