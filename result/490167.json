Subsequent to the adoption of the new sentencing law in Illinois in 1978, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board offered Wallace the opportunity of remaining eligible for discretionary parole or waiving his right to parole and accepting a fixed date for release on a two-year term of mandatory supervised release (\"MSR\").  See Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-3-2.1 (1978).  Wallace requested the board establish a fixed date for his release on a two-year term of MSR, and the board set March 24, 1979 as the date of Wallace's release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wallace was released from prison on March 23, 1979 on MSR, but thereafter was convicted of theft in Illinois while on MSR,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> sentenced to 364 days of incarceration and returned to prison on August 18, 1979 for violating the terms of his mandatory supervised release.  On March 28, 1980, Wallace was again released on a program of mandatory supervised release but three months thereafter on July 8, 1980 a warrant was issued for Wallace's arrest for absconding from the mandatory supervised release program and for failure to report timely to his MSR supervisor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   On August 29, 1980, police in Redding, California arrested and jailed Wallace on burglary charges.  On January 12, 1981, Wallace pled guilty to receiving stolen property in California and received a six-month term of imprisonment with the understanding that his California sentence would be commuted to time served upon his surrender to Illinois authorities.  Wallace waived extradition and was returned to Illinois on January 26, 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1981, Wallace was awarded 28 days of meritorious good time credit toward his Illinois burglary sentence and, on March 13, Wallace was granted an additional 90 days of meritorious good time credit by the Illinois prison authorities and released.  On April 23, 1983, Wallace, proceeding pro se, filed this suit for damages naming Jim Greer, the warden of Menard State Prison, Menard, Illinois, and Michael P. Lane, the Director of the Illinois Department of Corrections as defendants.  Wallace alleged that he was unlawfully confined by the defendants in prison after the expiration of his burglary sentence.

The district court interpreted the complaint as alleging that Illinois prison officials unlawfully imprisoned Wallace because they miscalculated Wallace's 2-6 year burglary sentence.  In the complaint, Wallace fails to specify the basis of his allegation that the Illinois authorities miscalculated his sentence.  It seems that the district court assumed that Wallace was contending that the length of his Illinois sentence should have been reduced commensurate with the period of time he was confined in California.  In its order granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the district court stated that \"[i]n his [Wallace's] Complaint, the plaintiff alleges that from the months of January, 1981, to March, 1981, he was unlawfully imprisoned by defendants.\"    Wallace v. Greer, No. 83-3096 (S.D.Ill. May 3, 1985), p. 2.  The court further stated that \"[p]laintiff claims that the five months of time spent imprisoned in California should have been credited to the sentence he was compelled to complete in Illinois.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, counsel for Wallace conceded that the Illinois prison authorities had accurately computed Wallace's sentence insofar as it was proper under Illinois law not to credit Wallace with the time he spent in confinement in California.  Counsel for Wallace contends that because the district court failed to decide the issue presented in Wallace's complaint we should therefore reverse.  Specifically, we interpret Wallace's argument as alleging that the trial court decided in error that he was not entitled to credit on his Illinois sentence for the time he was incarcerated in California and further that the court failed to address the issue of whether Wallace was unlawfully incarcerated in early 1981 on his return to Illinois from California.  He maintains that the proper issue framed for the district court's decision was whether a question of material fact remained concerning whether Wallace had in fact completed his Illinois sentence prior to his return to Illinois from California in January, 1981.  Despite the fact that Greer, Lane, and the Illinois Prison Board acted properly in not crediting Wallace for the time spent in confinement in California, counsel for Wallace maintains that Wallace's sentence still may have been miscalculated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Miller v.

Since Wallace was convicted of burglary, a class two felony under Illinois law, Wallace's mandatory supervised release term was determined under the statute to be two years.  See Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-8-1 (1983);  Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, para. 19-1 (1983).  Wallace was released on March 23, 1979, and, thus his mandatory supervised release term would not expire until March 23, 1981.  Since Wallace was released from his sentence on March 13, 1981, he cannot now properly claim that he was unlawfully incarcerated beyond the expiration of his sentence.  Further, the defendants' claim that Wallace could not have been unlawfully incarcerated beyond the expiration of his term is buttressed by the fact that the running of his MSR term was tolled when he absconded to California.  See Ill.Rev.Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-3-9 (1983).  Since Wallace's MSR term stopped running when he absconded from supervision and was declared an MSR violator on May 30, 1980 and could not start again until after he was returned to Illinois on January 26, 1981, seven months and twenty-six days could have been added to his term.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>   Since Wallace was not unlawfully detained past the expiration of his sentence, we hold that the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Wallace maintains that the district court abused its discretion in denying Wallace's motions for the appointment of counsel in this case.

However, the good conduct credits Wallace earned after his return to prison on August 18, 1979 as a violator of his MSR due to his conviction for theft were applied to reduce his 364 day sentence for his theft conviction, permitting him to be released again on MSR on March 28, 1980.  Wallace was not again entitled to have his sentence reduced through the accumulation of good conduct credits until his return to the Illinois prison system on January 26, 1981.
