The thrust of Salem\u2019s petition\nis that the Board\u2019s misapplication of its own adjudicatory\nprocedures denied Salem a fair opportunity to contest the\nbargaining unit\u2019s certification.      Although the Board\u2019s\nproceedings are indeed gaffe-ridden, Salem has failed to\nestablish that it was prejudiced thereby. For the reasons set\nforth below, we deny Salem\u2019s petition for review and grant the\nBoard\u2019s cross-application for enforcement.\n\n                    I. BACKGROUND\n\n     Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or\nAct) provides that employees may \u201cform, join, or assist labor\norganizations, to bargain collectively through representatives\nof their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted\nactivities for the purpose of collective bargaining.\u201d 29 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 157. An election held to determine whether a union is\nentitled to represent a group of employees\u2014i.e., a\n\f                                   3\nrepresentation election\u2014must be conducted in \u201c \u2018laboratory\nconditions[,]\u2019 free from coercion\u201d from employer and union\nalike. See SSC Mystic Operating Co. v. NLRB, 801 F.3d 302,\n309 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citing 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)\n(prohibiting employer and union from \u201cinterfer[ing] with,\nrestrain[ing], or coerc[ing] employees in the exercise\u201d of their\ncollective bargaining rights)).\n\n     Particularly relevant here, an employee who acts as a\nsupervisor does not have section 7 rights. 1 And, like the\nemployer and the union, he may not interfere with an\nemployee\u2019s exercise of section 7 rights. See SSC Mystic, 801\nF.3d at 309. If a \u201csupervisor\u2019s conduct reasonably tend[s] to\nhave such a coercive effect on the employees that it [is] likely\nto impair their freedoms of choice in the election,\u201d the Board\nfinds \u201csupervisory taint.\u201d See Harborside Healthcare, Inc.,\n343 N.L.R.B. 906, 908 (2004). Supervisory taint affecting a\npetition for a representation election can result in the dismissal\nof the petition. See Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. Casehandling\nManual, Pt. 2, Representation Proceedings (Manual)\n\u00a7 11730.3(a) (2014); see also id. \u00a7 11028.2; SSC Mystic, 801\nF.3d at 310.\n\n     The Act also charges the Board with determining an\nappropriate collective bargaining unit. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 159(b).\nPursuant to this duty, the Board investigates a petition filed by\nthe employees (or a labor organization acting on their behalf),\n        1\n           The Act defines a supervisor as \u201cany individual having\nauthority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend,\nlay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other\nemployees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their\ngrievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in\nconnection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of\na merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of\nindependent judgment.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11).\n\f                                 4\ndeclaring that they \u201cwish to be represented for collective\nbargaining and that their employer declines to recognize their\nrepresentative.\u201d Id. \u00a7 159(b). An employer can agree to\nconduct an election and resolve disputes after the fact, see 29\nC.F.R. \u00a7 102.62,2 but if a petition is filed and no agreement is\nreached, a Board Regional Director (RD) sets a \u201crepresentation\nhearing\u201d to determine if the petition concerns a \u201cunit\nappropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 102.67(a). The hearing officer (HO) does not render a\ndecision; rather, his duty is to \u201cinquire fully into all matters and\nissues necessary to obtain a full and complete record upon\nwhich the Board or the [RD] may discharge their duties.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 102.64(a) (emphasis in original).\n\n      The Federal Rules of Evidence are not \u201ccontrolling\u201d in a\nrepresentation hearing, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.66(a); see also Manual\n\u00a7 11216, but by regulation the Board has set forth detailed\nprocedures.      For example, all parties \u201chave the right\nto . . . examine, and cross-examine witnesses, and to introduce\ninto the record documentary and other evidence.\u201d 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.66(a). In addition, the HO \u201cshall, on the written\napplication of any party, forthwith issue subpoenas requiring\nthe attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production\nof any evidence . . . under their control.\u201d Id. \u00a7 102.66(c);\naccord 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 161(1). Based on the record the HO\nassembles, the RD may \u201cdirect an election, dismiss the\npetition, or make other disposition of the matter.\u201d 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.67(a). The RD\u2019s decision is appealable to the Board.\nId. \u00a7 102.67(b).\n\n\n\n        2\n          Unless otherwise indicated, all citations to the Code of\nFederal Regulations refer to the version in effect at the time the\ndescribed events took place.\n\f                                  5\n     When an election is held and it produces no objections, the\nRD issues \u201ca certification of the results of the election,\nincluding certification of representative where appropriate.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 102.69(b). If objections to the election are filed, the RD\nmay dispose of them via an \u201cadministrative investigation\u201d if\nthey do not \u201craise substantial and material factual issues,\u201d id.\n\u00a7 102.69(d); see also Manual \u00a7 11395.1; otherwise a hearing is\nset before another HO to determine their merit. 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.69(d). 3 If a hearing is held, the presiding officer\n(whether HO or ALJ) issues a \u201creport resolving questions of\ncredibility and containing findings of fact and\nrecommendations as to the disposition of the issues.\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 102.69(e). The parties may thereafter file \u201cexceptions\u201d to\nthe report, id., which exceptions the Board may ultimately\nreview. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 102.69(f), 102.67(c). Once this procedure\nruns its course, the Board may certify the union but a\ncertification is generally not immediately judicially\nreviewable. See, e.g., Hartz Mountain Corp. v. Dotson, 727\nF.2d 1308, 1310\u201311 (D.C. Cir. 1984). To obtain judicial\nreview of the certification, an employer can decline to bargain\nwith the certified union, which declination then produces a\nULP complaint.4 See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(5), 160(f). The\n\n        3\n           If there is simultaneously pending an unfair labor practices\n(ULP) proceeding, the RD \u201cmay consolidate the [representation]\nhearing . . . before an administrative law judge\u201d instead of an HO.\n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c)(1)(ii) (2015); id. \u00a7 102.33(a), (c) (2010).\n        4\n          Although the Board\u2019s General Counsel (GC) exercises\nultimate authority over the prosecution of a ULP complaint, see 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 153(d), the RD plays a substantial role in the process. For\nexample, the ULP charge is generally filed with the RD of the region\nin which the alleged ULP has occurred or is occurring. 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.10. The RD then investigates to determine whether a\ncomplaint should issue. The investigation may be \u201cas simple as\nascertaining whether certain statements were made . . . . [o]r, the\ncase may be as complex as ascertaining whether the parties\u2019 overall\n\f                                  6\nBoard\u2019s handling\u2014and, at times, mishandling\u2014of its layered\nprocedure forms the heart of this case.\n\n     Salem is an acute-care facility located in Salem, New\nJersey. On May 19, 2010, Health Professionals and Allied\nEmployees AFT, AFL-CIO (HPAE or Union) filed an election\npetition with the Board to represent Salem\u2019s registered nurses.\nThe proposed unit included charge nurses (CNs), who, Salem\nmaintained, were supervisors and thus ineligible for\nrepresentation under the Act. A representation hearing before\nan HO began on June 2, 2010, to create the record on which the\nRD was to determine the CNs\u2019 status and the appropriateness\nof the proposed bargaining unit.\n\n     While the representation hearing was underway, Salem\nfiled a ULP charge against HPAE alleging supervisory taint\nresulting from the involvement of two alleged supervisory CNs\nin the filing of the petition. Upon receiving the charge, the\nRD began a second process to resolve the taint dispute: Salem\nwas directed to provide the RD with evidence regarding the\nCNs\u2019 alleged involvement in the filing, while the record\n\nconduct over the course of protracted contract negotiations violated\n[the Act].\u201d See Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. Casehandling Manual,\nPt. 1, Unfair Labor Practice Proceedings \u00a7 10050 (2015). The\ncharging party must, inter alia, meet with Board agents and comply\nwith any reasonable request necessary to complete the investigation.\nSee id. \u00a7 10054.1. If the charging party delays presentation of\nevidence without cause, the charge is \u201csubject to dismissal for lack\nof cooperation.\u201d Id. If the charging party\u2019s evidence presents a\n\u201cprima facie case,\u201d the charged party \u201cshould be contacted to\nprovide additional and more complete evidence.\u201d               See id.\n\u00a7 10054.4. The RD issues a complaint if \u201cit appears . . . that formal\nproceedings in respect [of the charge] should be instituted\u201d and sets a\nhearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.15. At this point, the GC prosecutes the complaint.\n\f                               7\nregarding the predicate CN supervisory status question was yet\nto be completed by the HO conducting the representation\nhearing.\n\n     Over a one-week period, June 2\u20139, 2010, witnesses for\nboth Salem and the Union testified at the representation\nhearing. Two complications arose. First, Salem moved to\ntransfer the proceeding to another regional office, alleging that\nthe HO had engaged in ex parte communications with certain\nCN witnesses. The motion was denied, first by the HO and,\nultimately, by the GC. Second, Salem requested that the HO\nprepare subpoenas for certain witnesses. Although the HO\nconfirmed that the subpoenas would be prepared, see\nRepresentation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 807 (\u201c[Salem\u2019s Counsel] has\nrequested some subpoenas. They are being prepared.\u201d), he\nclosed the record on the following day over Salem\u2019s objection.\n\n     The RD\u2019s concurrent investigation of Salem\u2019s supervisory\ntaint charge also proved troublesome. Salem missed multiple\ndeadlines to produce witnesses for RD interviews. Moreover,\nthe affidavit evidence it submitted to the RD was deemed\ninsufficient. See Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s Letter of Dismissal 1 (\u201cEven\nassuming that these charge nurses are supervisors within the\nmeaning of . . . the Act, there is insufficient evidence to\nestablish that the charge nurses\u2019 limited prounion activities\ncoerced employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights.\u201d).\nThe RD then closed the investigation and declined to issue a\ncomplaint. Salem appealed the RD\u2019s decision to the GC but\nits appeal was denied. See Gen. Counsel\u2019s Denial of Hosp.\u2019s\nAppeal of Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s Refusal to Issue Compl.\n\n    On August 2, 2010, using the HO\u2019s record from the\nrepresentation hearing, the RD issued her decision regarding\n\f                                  8\nthe CNs\u2019 supervisory status. She concluded that all but two5\nof Salem\u2019s CNs were not supervisors and issued a \u201cdirection of\nelection.\u201d The election took place on September 1\u20132, 2010.\nSalem challenged the RD\u2019s election order, arguing, inter alia,\nthat the HO\u2019s record closure was premature, repeating its\nallegation of ex parte communications between the HO and\nCN witnesses and claiming that the alleged supervisors tainted\nthe election petition.      The Board denied the petition,\nconcluding that Salem raised no issues warranting review.\nThereafter, the election results were released and revealed that\nthe Union won 73\u201348.\n\n     Salem next moved the RD to set aside the election results,\nraising 20 objections. Objections 1\u201316 tracked the events\nleading up to the election, that is, Salem\u2019s supervisory taint\ncharge and the proceedings resulting in the determination that\nthe CNs were not supervisors. Objections 18\u201320 involved\nallegations of impropriety that occurred during the election.6\nOn January 10, 20117 the RD set a hearing before an HO to\nresolve the objections. The case was then consolidated with a\npending ULP proceeding initiated by the Union and set to be\nheard by an ALJ on February 22.8\n\n\n         5\n         The RD excluded the two nurses from the bargaining unit.\nSee Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s Decision and Direction of Election at 23 n.12.\n         6\n           On December 30, 2010, Salem abandoned Objection 17 by\nletter to the RD.\n         7\n             All subsequent dates occurred in 2011 unless otherwise\nnoted.\n         8\n          The consolidation occurred because there was a pending\nULP complaint against Salem based on charges the Union made. It\nwithdrew the charges before the hearing began. See Union\u2019s Mot.\nfor Special Permission to Appeal at 2 n.5; Salem Hosp. Corp., &\nHealth Prof\u2019ls & Allied Emps., JD-14-11, 2011 WL 1043489 (Mar.\n\f                                9\n     On February 15, the Union filed a \u201crequest for special\npermission to appeal\u201d (Special Appeal) with the Board,\narguing that Salem\u2019s Objections 1\u201316 had already been\ndecided and urging the Board to reverse the RD\u2019s decision\nsetting a hearing thereon. Seven days later\u2014before Salem\nresponded and on the same day the ALJ began the\nrepresentation hearing\u2014the Board granted the Special Appeal\nand reversed the RD\u2019s decision. Salem filed its response to\nthe Union\u2019s Special Appeal with the Board later that same day.\n\n    Although the Board overturned the RD\u2019s decision to set a\nhearing on Objections 1\u201316, it remanded the Objections to the\nRD for disposition. The RD administratively dismissed them\non February 24. Before the ALJ reached the merits of the\nremaining Objections, Salem made two separate filings with\nthe Board. First, Salem moved for reconsideration of the\nBoard\u2019s grant of the Union\u2019s Special Appeal, arguing that its\nregulations did not allow for the procedure and that, assuming\nthey did, Salem was, at a minimum, entitled to respond.\nSecond, Salem appealed the RD\u2019s administrative dismissal of\nObjections 1\u201316. Before the Board ruled on either motion,\nthe ALJ found against Salem on Objections 18\u201320 and\n\n23, 2011). It is, however, unclear whether Board procedure was\nfollowed when the ALJ continued to hear the representation case.\nBoard rules direct that an HO conduct a hearing on objections to an\nelection. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(d); cf. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c)(1)(ii)\n(2015) (\u201c[E]xcept that the regional director may consolidate the\nhearing concerning objections and challenges with an unfair labor\npractice proceeding before an administrative law judge.\u201d). By the\ntime the hearing set for February 22nd occurred, the ULP complaint\nhad been withdrawn. The rules authorize the RD to sever a\npreviously consolidated case, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.33(a)(4), (c), and,\npresumably, assign the representation hearing to an HO and the ULP\nproceeding to an ALJ. Here the RD instead allowed the remaining\nrepresentation hearing to proceed before the ALJ.\n\f                                  10\nexplained that he did not resolve Objections 1\u201316. See Salem\nHosp. Corp., & Health Prof\u2019ls & Allied Emps., JD-14-11, 2011\nWL 1043489 (Mar. 23, 2011) (\u201cI have not treated with or\nconsidered in any respects [Salem\u2019s] Objections 1\u201316.\u201d).\n\n     On April 6, Salem filed seven exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s\ndecision, arguing that he erred in declining to rule on\nObjections 1\u201316 and that his findings on Objections 18\u201320\nwere wrong on the merits. On August 3, the Board9 denied\nthe exceptions and certified HPAE as the exclusive collective\nbargaining representative for Salem\u2019s registered nurses\n(including CNs).        The Board also denied Salem\u2019s\nreconsideration motion regarding the Union\u2019s Special Appeal.\nThe Board, however, neglected to dispose of Salem\u2019s appeal of\nthe RD\u2019s administrative dismissal of Objections 1\u201316.\n\n    Salem then refused to recognize or bargain with HPAE\nand, on September 14, the GC filed a ULP complaint alleging\n\n        9\n           Although it is unclear from the record, Salem claims that it\n\u201cfiled with the Board timely Exceptions to [the ALJ\u2019s] decision,\u201d\nPet\u2019r Br. at 14 (emphasis added); Employer\u2019s Br. in Sup. of its\nExceptions to the Rec. Dec. of Administrative Law Judge Earl E.\nShamwell, Jr., at 1, and indeed, the Board ruled on them.\nParenthetically, the rules now direct that exceptions to a\npost-election representation hearing order must be filed with, and\nruled on by, the RD. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c)(iii) (2015) (\u201cAny party\nmay, within 14 days of the issuance of such report, file with the\nregional director . . . exceptions to such report . . . . . The regional\ndirector shall thereupon decide the matter upon the record or make\nother disposition of the case.\u201d). An appeal may then be taken to the\nBoard.      Id. \u00a7 102.69(c)(2) (\u201cThe decision of the regional\ndirector . . . shall be final unless a request for review is granted [by\nthe Board].\u201d). Granted, exceptions to an ALJ\u2019s ULP ruling are filed\ndirectly with the Board, id.; 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.46 (2015), but the\nUnion had dropped its ULP complaint, see supra n.8.\n\f                              11\nthat \u201c[o]n or about August 17, Respondent, by letter of [CEO],\nnotified the Union that it refused to recognize and bargain with\nthe Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative\nof the Unit.\u201d Complaint and Notice of Hearing, Case\n04-CA-064455 at 2. Salem conceded its refusal but raised as\n\u201caffirmative defenses\u201d many of the alleged improprieties that\nplagued the earlier proceedings\u2014specifically, that: (1) the\nBoard should have sustained Salem\u2019s objections to the\nelection; (2) the Board should not have granted the Union\u2019s\nSpecial Appeal; (3) the GC should have transferred the\nrepresentation hearing to another HO; (4) the GC should have\nissued a complaint in connection with Salem\u2019s supervisory\ntaint charge; and (5) the Board impermissibly failed to rule on\nSalem\u2019s appeal of the RD\u2019s dismissal of Objections 1\u201316.\n\n     An ALJ hearing was scheduled for December 14, but, on\nOctober 12, the GC moved for summary judgment before the\nBoard. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.24(a) (summary judgment\nmotion is to be filed with Board). Before ruling on the\nmotion, the Board issued an \u201cerratum\u201d amending its August 3rd\ncertification order. The one-page order acknowledged the\nBoard\u2019s failure to resolve Salem\u2019s appeal of the RD\u2019s\ndismissal of Salem\u2019s Objections 1\u201316 and purported to deny it\nnunc pro tunc. Finally, on November 29 the Board granted\nthe GC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ULP\ncomplaint, concluding that all of Salem\u2019s defenses either\nwere\u2014or could have been\u2014litigated in the earlier\nproceedings.

NLRB, 313 U.S. 146, 162 (1941)).\n\n     Salem timely petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s\nNovember 29 order and the Board cross-applied for\nenforcement. Our jurisdiction is based on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e),\n(f).\n\f                                12\n                        II. ANALYSIS\n\n     Salem\u2019s several challenges focus, at bottom, on the\nBoard\u2019s faulty adherence to its procedure.10 Our review is for\nabuse of discretion, see Canadian Am. Oil Co. v. NLRB, 82\nF.3d 469, 473\u201376 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (reviewing challenged\nprocedural steps), and Salem must show that \u201cprejudice\nresulted from\u201d the Board\u2019s lapses. Desert Hosp. v. NLRB, 91\nF.3d 187, 190 (D.C. Cir. 1996). This it fails to do. Our\nanalysis is informed by the significant deference we accord the\nBoard\u2019s determination of an appropriate bargaining unit,\nreversing only if the certification is \u201carbitrary and without\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d Cleveland Constr., Inc. v. NLRB, 44\nF.3d 1010, 1014 (D.C. Cir. 1995).\n\n     A. CLOSING REPRESENTATION HEARING RECORD\n\n     First, Salem challenges the HO\u2019s closure of the record\nbefore Salem could present evidence supporting its claim\nregarding the CNs\u2019 supervisory taint. The NLRA is largely\nsilent on the gathering and presentation of evidence at a\nrepresentation hearing but the Board has provided substantial\nguidance by regulation. For example, it is the HO\u2019s duty to\n\u201cinquire fully into all matters and issues necessary to obtain a\nfull and complete record.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.64(a). The\nhearing itself is \u201cinvestigatory, intended to make a full record\n\n        10\n           Under recent Board precedent, Salem also challenges the\nvalidity of the regulation\u201429 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.30(a)\u2014pursuant to\nwhich the Union was certified. Because Salem did not press its\nargument in the proceedings before the Board, however, it is\nforfeited. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (\u201cNo objection that has not been\nurged before the Board . . . . shall be considered by the court.\u201d).\nMoreover, we reviewed the challenged regulation in San Miguel\nHosp. Corp. v. NLRB, 697 F.3d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 2012), and upheld it\nagainst an identical challenge.\n\f                                13\nand nonadversarial.\u201d See Manual \u00a7 11181. Before the\nhearing closes, the HO is to ask \u201con the record, whether [the\nparties] have anything further to add.\u201d See id. \u00a7 11240. And\nhe \u201cshall, on the written application of any party, forthwith\nissue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of\nwitnesses.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.66(c) (emphasis added); see also\nid. (\u201cThe Regional Director or the hearing officer . . . shall\nforthwith grant the subpoenas requested.\u201d).11\n\n    The HO\u2019s premature closing of the record was without\nexplanation.    One day after announcing that Salem\u2019s\nrequested subpoenas would issue, he closed the record over\nSalem\u2019s objection. Granted, the HO apparently agreed with\nthe Union that Salem\u2019s requested witnesses were cumulative12\n\n        11\n           The NLRA contains a similar provision. See 29 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 161(1) (Board \u201cshall upon application of any party to such\nproceedings, forthwith issue to such party subp[o]enas requiring the\nattendance and testimony of witnesses\u201d). The Board may revoke a\nsubpoena only if \u201cin its opinion the evidence whose production is\nrequired does not relate to any matter under investigation, or any\nmatter in question in such proceedings, or if in its opinion such\nsubp[o]ena does not describe with sufficient particularity the\nevidence whose production is required.\u201d          Id.    In Drukker\nCommunications v. NLRB, 700 F.2d 727 (D.C. Cir. 1983), we\nrecognized two grounds (\u201cunwarranted interference with First\nAmendment rights,\u201d id. at 730, and whether production would \u201charm\nthe public interest,\u201d id. at 731) for revoking a subpoena but\nconcluded that, in the absence of an express or implied ground,\nrevocation amounts to agency action \u201cwithout observance of\nprocedure required by law.\u201d Id. at 734; see also 5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 706(2)(D). Salem does not argue that closing the record also\nviolated the statute.\n        12\n           The Union argued that \u201c[t]his testimony is cumulative or\nrepetitive . . . we would just object and ask that the testimony be\nlimited.\u201d        Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 915.           The HO\n\f                                14\nbut that inference is hardly ineluctable. According to the\nrecord, the HO stated only that \u201cthe Employer and the\nPetitioner have had an opportunity to discuss the supervisory\nstatus of the charge nurses\u201d and that he was \u201cnot going to take\nadditional testimony.\u201d Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 916. In\nher decision on the CNs\u2019 supervisory status, the RD also failed\nto explain the HO\u2019s failure to issue the subpoenas.\n\n     Notwithstanding this misstep, the record does not indicate\nthat Salem sought to introduce relevant, non-cumulative\nevidence and, without that, we cannot find that Salem was\nprejudiced. See Reno Hilton Resorts v. NLRB, 196 F.3d 1275,\n1285 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (no abuse of discretion where\nexcluded evidence would not \u201ccompel or persuade to a\ncontrary result\u201d (quoting Cooley v. FERC, 843 F.2d 1464,\n1473 (D.C. Cir. 1988))); cf. Ozark Auto. Distribs., Inc. v.\nNLRB, 779 F.3d 576, 580\u201381 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (vacating\ndecision to exclude evidence that was non-cumulative and\ncritical to employer\u2019s defense). At the hearing, Salem simply\nasserted that it had \u201cadditional witnesses who will be probative\nof the . . . supervisory status of charge nurses\u201d and that it\nintended to go \u201cthrough the same kind of questioning of those\nwitnesses as [it] did with [its previous] witnesses and as the\nUnion ha[d] done with their witnesses. It would concern the\ntestimony of [the] Union\u2019s witnesses and embellishment of\nthat position and testimony.\u201d Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 914\n(emphasis added).13\n\n\n\ncontemporaneously \u201crule[d] that [he would] not allow any additional\ntestimony.\u201d Id.\n        13\n           In its brief, Salem claims that the \u201cUnion voiced no\nobjection to the Hospital\u2019s desire to offer further evidence.\u201d Pet\u2019r\nBr. at 25\u201326. But, as we noted, see supra n.12, that is not true. In\naddition, although the record is unclear, we note that Salem\u2019s\n\f                                  15\n    In any event, the Board\u2019s determination of the CNs\u2019\nnon-supervisory status is supported by substantial evidence.\nThe RD made detailed findings14 based on the representation\nhearing record and her reasoning sufficed to support her\ndetermination regarding the CNs\u2019 non-supervisory status. See\nReg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s Decision and Direction of Election. Further, the\nBoard finds against supervisory status if there is conflicting\nevidence in the record, see Phelps Cmty. Med. Ctr., 295 NLRB\n486, 490 (1989) (\u201c[W]henever the evidence is in conflict or\notherwise inconclusive on particular indicia of supervisory\n\n\ncounsel apparently requested the subpoenas as a delaying tactic to\nprevent the HO\u2019s closing the record. After the HO predicted that\nthe hearing would conclude within one day, Salem\u2019s counsel\nasserted: \u201cNot if I have anything to do with it. Request for\nsubpoenas, the issuance of subpoenas.\u201d Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at\n805. If this is so, it is indeed regrettable. We have previously\nnoted the sharp practice of Salem\u2019s counsel in proceedings before us\nand do so again here in an effort to stop its repetition. See San\nMiguel Hosp. Corp., 697 F.3d at 1188 (\u201cAs we noted at the outset,\nthe Hospital unleashed a blizzard of arguments to challenge the\nBoard\u2019s unfair-labor-practice orders. It might be appropriate to\nsuggest that in appellate argument, the proverbial rifle is preferable\nto a machine gun\u2014but that would assume petitioner had at least a\nfew good arguments; it did not. In truth, it appears to us that all the\nHospital sought was the inevitable delay that review of Board orders\naffords.\u201d).\n        14\n            See Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s Decision and Direction of Election at 17\n(finding Salem CNs assign nurses to patients but process \u201cdoes not\ninvolve independent judgment\u201d and nurses \u201cgenerally meet and\ndecide among themselves which nurse should care for which\npatient\u201d); id. at 19 (finding Salem CNs direct aides to perform some\nrudimentary tasks but \u201cany nurse, not only a CN, may request that\naides perform such functions\u201d and \u201cassignment of [these] basic tasks\n[does not] require[] independent judgment.\u201d); id. at 20 (only\ndisciplinary authority CNs have is to issue \u201cwritten warning\u201d).\n\f                                16\nauthority, we will find that supervisory status has not been\nestablished.\u201d), and that is what it did here. See Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s\nDecision and Direction of Election at 17 n.11 (\u201cAt best,\n[Salem] can argue that the evidence is in conflict as to whether\nthe CNs [exercise supervisory authority]. The Board will not\nfind supervisory status in the face of such a conflict.\u201d).\nNonetheless, Salem contends that the excluded testimony\nwould have resolved conflicting evidence tending to show\nnon-supervisory status.15 We do not see how, by introducing\nmore conflicting testimony, Salem could have solved the\nevidentiary conflict.\n\n     Salem relies on our Ozark decision to argue that parties\nhave a right to present all relevant evidence during a\nrepresentation hearing. But Ozark involved substantially\ndifferent facts. There, the employer challenged the Board\u2019s\ncertification because four of its employees allegedly \u201cacted as\nagents of the union.\u201d Ozark, 779 F.3d at 580. In a\npost-election objection hearing, the employer served\nsubpoenas duces tecum on the union and on an employee who,\naccording to the employer, had acted as a union agent. Id. at\n578. Both the union and the employee objected to the\nsubpoenas on the grounds of overbreadth and privilege. Id.\nAfter reserving her ruling on the subpoenas, the HO eventually\ngranted the union\u2019s and the employee\u2019s motions to revoke the\nsubpoenas without examining the documents the employer\nsought. Id. at 578\u201379. We found that the HO\u2019s revocation\naction violated Board procedure. Id. at 581\u201382. The Board\u2019s\nGuide for Hearing Officers in Representation Proceedings\n\u201cstate[d] that when confidentiality or other objections are\nraised to oppose a subpoena . . . the hearing officer should\n\n        15\n           See Pet\u2019r. Br. at 25 (arguing its witnesses would testify\nthat, based on their everyday working relationship with CNs, patient\nassignment was \u201chardly \u2018collaborative\u2019 \u201d).\n\f                                  17\nconsider receiving the material in camera and reviewing the\ndocuments to determine whether redacting certain information\nor narrowing the scope of the subpoena might cure the\nobjection.\u201d Id. at 582. We concluded that the procedural\nflaw prejudiced the employer because establishing that\nemployees acted as union agents was critical to the employer\u2019s\ndefense; in addition, the HO\u2019s delay in ruling on the subpoenas\nincreased the prejudice to the employer because, had the\nemployer known earlier that the subpoenas would be quashed,\nit could have \u201calter[ed] its presentation . . . . All trial lawyers\nknow the danger of the unknown.\u201d Id.\n\n     We are not persuaded by Salem\u2019s attempt to align its case\nwith Ozark. In Ozark we found prejudice based on both the\nrelevant and non-cumulative nature of the evidence sought to\nbe presented and the delay in ruling, which exposed the\nemployer to uncertainty in establishing its defense. Id. at\n582\u201383. By contrast, because Salem failed either to make a\nproffer or to provide any other specific evidence of potential\nwitnesses\u2019 testimony,16 we cannot determine that the excluded\nevidence was either relevant or material.\n\n\n        16\n            At oral argument Salem\u2019s counsel contended that its\nproffer was made orally, see Oral Arg. Recording at 3:30 (\u201cCounsel\nfor the hospital explicitly references the house supervisors and the\nneed, in light of the evidence elicited by the Union . . . to put on the\nhouse supervisors to explain their duties and also to explain the\nillogical position being taken during testimony by the charge\nnurses.\u201d); see also Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 914\u201315 (\u201c[I]t would be\nthe house supervisors\u201d and \u201cit would concern the testimony of [the]\nUnion\u2019s witnesses and embellishment of that position and\ntestimony.\u201d). To the extent we can consider the foregoing a proffer,\nit hardly tells us what the witnesses would testify to, much less how\ntheir testimony could \u201cpersuade to a contrary result,\u201d Reno Hilton\nResorts, 196 F.3d at 1285 n.10, given the Board\u2019s practice of finding\n\f                               18\n    In sum, despite the Board\u2019s unexplained failure to allow a\nparty to submit evidence at a representation hearing, Salem has\nnot, as it must, established prejudice. Accordingly, we\nconclude that the HO\u2019s premature closing of the record was not\nan abuse of discretion.\n\n    B. FAILURE TO TRANSFER FOR ALLEGED EX PARTE\n                  COMMUNICATIONS\n\n    Salem next challenges the GC\u2019s failure, on review from\nthe HO\u2019s similar failure, to transfer the representation hearing\nto another region in light of the alleged ex parte\ncommunications. The Board\u2019s regulations prohibit ex parte\ncommunications.         29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.126(b) (\u201cNo Board\nagent . . . participating in [relevant proceedings], shall . . .\nmake or knowingly cause to be made any prohibited ex parte\ncommunications about the proceeding to any interested person\noutside this agency relevant to the merits of the proceeding.\u201d).\nBoard regulations also grant the GC power to transfer the case\n\u201cin order to effectuate the purposes of the [NLRA].\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 102.33(a).\n\n     The GC\u2019s failure to transfer was reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Salem did not make specific allegations of ex\nparte communications, see Gen. Counsel\u2019s Denial of Hosp.\u2019s\nMot. to Transfer at 2 (July 27, 2010) (\u201cInitially, outside of\nunsubstantiated claims, your communication references no\nevidence of such ex parte meetings.\u201d), and the GC\u2019s own\ninvestigation found that \u201cneither the Hearing Officer nor his\nsupervisor engaged in any.\u201d Id. In fact, the \u201cHearing\nOfficer\u2019s contact with the Employer\u2019s nurses, except for an\n\n\n\nagainst supervisory status if there is conflicting evidence.   See\nPhelps Cmty. Med. Ctr., 295 NLRB at 490.\n\f                               19\noccasional pleasantry, was limited to those times when they\nwere testifying on the record.\u201d Id.\n\n     Salem faults the GC for failing to request its evidence of\nex parte communications but cites no regulation or policy that\nrequires the GC to affirmatively seek evidence. Moreover,\nSalem had the opportunity to present its evidence, both in its\npetition for transfer before the GC and in its earlier motion\nbefore the HO. But the petition contained only conclusory\nassertions, see Salem\u2019s Mot. to Transfer at 1 n.1 (\u201cIt was\napparent during the hearing (specifically on June 4, 2010)\nthat . . . [the HO] had met privately with the Union\u2019s two\nattorneys and at least [one CN] . . . regarding various issues\nrelated to the petition.\u201d), and the same was true at the hearing.\nSee Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 618 (\u201cI would imagine that\nthere are Board agents . . . who are bound by certain ethical\nconsideration, in terms of meeting with a supervisor of this\nEmployer in my absence. And I just want the Regional Office\nto understand, if that is something which is in play here . . . I\nwould recommend that serious thought be given to whether or\nnot to modify that behavior.\u201d).\n\n     In any event, Salem does not claim that it was prejudiced\nby the decision not to transfer.          Indeed, \u201cex parte\ncommunications, even when undisclosed during agency\nproceedings, do not necessarily void an agency decision.\u201d\nProf\u2019l Air Traffic Controllers Org. v. FLRA, 685 F.2d 547, 564\n(D.C. Cir. 1982). Rather, a party must show that \u201cas a result\nof improper ex parte communications, the agency\u2019s\ndecisionmaking process was irrevocably tainted.\u201d            Id.\nBecause Salem has not shown prejudice, we conclude that\nneither the HO nor the GC abused his discretion.17\n\n       17\n         In its brief Salem argued that the alleged ex parte\ncommunications meant that the HO had prejudged the CNs\u2019 status.\n\f                                 20\n                 C. UNION\u2019S SPECIAL APPEAL\n\n     Salem makes two arguments regarding the Union\u2019s\nSpecial Appeal of the RD\u2019s decision to set a hearing on\nSalem\u2019s Objections 1\u201316. First, Salem asserts that no Board\nrule permits such an appeal. Second, it objects to the Board\u2019s\nfailure, in any event, to allow Salem to respond. The Board\u2019s\nerrors are not insignificant but, again, prejudice to Salem is\nlacking.\n\n     The Special Appeal was undoubtedly unauthorized. The\nUnion relied on 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.26 to press its Special Appeal\nbut that rule governs appeals in unfair labor practices\nproceedings. The Board asserts that another rule\u201429 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.65(c)\u2014permits the appeal. Even if the Board is correct,\nit misapplied the rule here.\n\n    At the time the Union made its Special Appeal, Section\n102.65(c) provided that\n\n        Requests to the regional director, or to the\n        Board in appropriate cases, for special\n        permission to appeal from a ruling of the\n        hearing officer, together with the appeal from\n        such ruling, shall be filed promptly, in writing,\n\nIts argument does not support a prejudice finding given that the\nRD\u2014not the HO\u2014makes the status determination. See 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.67 (directing that RD, not HO, render a decision). Salem also\nargued that, in order to protect the HO, the RD had an improper\nincentive to find no supervisory status. We reject this conclusory\nassertion. Cf. Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 55 (1975) (\u201cWithout\na showing to the contrary, [government actors] are assumed to be\nmen of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a\nparticular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.\u201d)\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\f                                 21\n        and shall briefly state (1) the reasons special\n        permission should be granted and (2) the\n        grounds relied on for the appeal. . . . Any\n        statement in opposition or other response to the\n        request and/or to the appeal shall be filed\n        promptly.\n\n(emphasis added). 18 Section 102.65(c) gave the Board\nconsiderable discretion in its implementation, viz., special\nappeals to the Board were permitted \u201cin appropriate cases.\u201d\n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.65(c). But the Board could not explain at oral\nargument why this was an \u201cappropriate case,\u201d see Oral Arg.\nRecording at 23:34\u201325:15 (\u201cI do not think it is\nunprecedented . . . . I could try to find out for you.\u201d). 19\nMoreover, the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfiled promptly\u201d here\nis inconsistent at best. The Board heard the Union\u2019s Special\nAppeal even though it was filed more than one month after the\nRD decision setting a hearing. If the Union\u2019s filing was\nprompt, then Salem\u2019s response within one week was\nalacritous. Yet the Board gave one party over one month to\n\n        18\n            The highlighted language has since been deleted.\nSection 102.65(c) now provides: \u201cRequests to the regional director\nfor special permission to appeal from a ruling of the hearing officer,\ntogether with the appeal from such ruling, shall be filed promptly, in\nwriting, and shall briefly state the reasons special permission should\nbe granted and the grounds relied on for the appeal. . . . Any\nstatement in opposition or other response to the request and/or to the\nappeal shall be filed promptly, in writing, and shall be served\nimmediately on the other parties and on the regional director.\u201d\n        19\n           If not unprecedented, the Board has apparently expanded\nthe scope of section 102.65(c) by allowing special appeals from an\nRD decision although special appeals were (and are) limited to \u201ca\nruling of the hearing officer.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.65(c); see also 29\nC.F.R. \u00a7 102.65(c) (2015).\n\f                                22\nfile without allowing the other side so much as a week to\nrespond.\n\n     Nonetheless, Salem once again cannot establish that the\nBoard\u2019s mistake prejudiced it. Salem asserts that, by granting\nthe Union\u2019s Special Appeal and reversing the RD\u2019s decision\nsetting a hearing, it was stripped of its ability to argue the\nmerits of Objections 1\u201316 to the ALJ. Although true, Salem\nwas not prejudiced thereby for at least three reasons. First,\nObjections 1\u201316 related to the CNs\u2019 supervisory status, an\nissue that had already been litigated before the Board. Even if\nSalem were allowed to make its arguments to the ALJ, we see\nno reason that the ALJ would have reached a conclusion\ncontrary to that of the Board. Second, if Salem were for some\nreason successful before the ALJ, the Board reviews his\ndecisions and the Board had already determined that Salem\u2019s\nobjections constituted prohibited relitigation.20 Finally, if the\nprocedural error did prejudice Salem, the prejudice was cured\nwhen the Board considered Salem\u2019s motion for\nreconsideration. Before certifying the Union, the Board\nreconsidered its earlier order\u2014this time with the benefit of\nSalem\u2019s response\u2014and reached the same conclusion.\n\n              D. BOARD\u2019S \u201cERRATUM\u201d ORDER\n\n    Salem next questions the propriety of the Board\u2019s\nErratum, which redressed the latter\u2019s failure to timely rule on\n\n        20\n           See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(d) (directing that hearing be held\nonly if there are \u201csubstantial and material factual issues\u201d). The\nUnion argued that Objections 1\u201316 did not meet this requirement\nbecause they were already \u201cdecided by the RD in the [decision and\ndirection of election], concerning which review was denied by the\nBoard,\u201d Union\u2019s Mot. for Special Permission to Appeal at 2, and the\nBoard agreed. See NLRB Order Granting Mot. for Special\nPermission to Appeal at 2.\n\f                                23\nSalem\u2019s appeal of the RD\u2019s administrative dismissal of\nObjections 1\u201316. But the Board had already determined that\nSalem\u2019s Objections 1\u201316 were meritless. It did so both when\nit denied Salem\u2019s petition for review of the RD\u2019s direction of\nelection and when it granted the Union\u2019s Special Appeal.\nSalem does not explain how the Board\u2019s issuance of the\nerratum was ultra vires or how the order prejudiced it.\n\n    E. BOARD\u2019S DENIAL OF SALEM\u2019S DEFENSE TO ULP\n                     CHARGE\n\n      Salem\u2019s final salvo is that the Board prevented it from\nlitigating supervisory taint as a defense to the ULP charge.\nWe do not see how Salem could establish taint without\nrelitigating the predicate supervisory question but it\nnonetheless maintains that the Board should have permitted it\nto make the argument as a defense in the ULP proceeding.\n\n     Board regulations generally prohibit\u2014in ULP\nproceedings\u2014relitigation of matters that arose at the earlier\nrepresentation proceeding stage. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.67(f)\n(\u201c[This rule] shall preclude . . . parties from relitigating, in any\nrelated subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding, any issue\nwhich was, or could have been, raised in the representation\nproceeding.\u201d (emphasis added)). We have upheld the rule,\nsee Pace Univ. v. NLRB, 514 F.3d 19, 23\u201324 (D.C. Cir. 2008),\nand only limited exceptions apply. For example, relitigation\nis allowed if newly discovered evidence requires\nreexamination of the representation decision. See Joseph T.\nRyerson & Sons, Inc. v. NLRB, 216 F.3d 1146, 1151 (D.C. Cir.\n2000) (\u201cIt is well established that in the absence of newly\ndiscovered evidence or other special circumstances requiring\nreexamination of the decision in the representation proceeding,\na respondent is not entitled to relitigate in a subsequent\nrefusal-to-bargain proceeding representation issues that were\n\f                              24\nor could have been litigated in the prior representation\nproceeding.\u201d (quotation omitted)).        Relitigation is also\npermitted if subsequent legal authority changes the relevant\nlaw. See Alois Box Co. v. NLRB, 216 F.3d 69, 78 (D.C. Cir\n2000) (\u201cBecause . . . the company failed to present legal\nauthority indicating that the Board had changed its standard for\ndetermining supervisory status\u201d the application of its \u201crule\nagainst relitigation\u201d was proper).         Again, we review\napplication of the Board\u2019s no-relitigation rule for abuse of\ndiscretion. See Pace Univ., 514 F.3d at 24.\n\n     The relitigation ban plainly applied to Salem. Salem had\nalready raised the CNs\u2019 supervisory status issue in the\nrepresentation proceeding and lost. It was also unsuccessful\nin pursuing its supervisory taint charge. Salem nonetheless\nmakes three arguments in favor of relitigation. First, Salem\nrecycles the argument about its inability to present supervisory\nstatus evidence at the representation hearing. We resolved\nthis issue at the representation hearing level, see supra part\nII.A, and Salem offers no reason for us to reconsider it at the\nULP stage. Next, Salem contends that parties in ULP\nproceedings are guaranteed the right to raise affirmative\ndefenses, notwithstanding the GC considered the facts\nsupporting the defense in the context of a potential charge and\ndeclined to issue a complaint. Although Salem is correct, see\nUnited Food and Commercial Workers v. NLRB, 675 F.2d 346,\n354\u201355 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (because \u201c[a] party subject to an\nunfair labor practice complaint has a right to a hearing\u201d and\n\u201cthe scope of the General Counsel's investigatory inquiry does\nnot approach that of the required hearing,\u201d GC\u2019s consideration\nand denial of charge cannot prevent party from litigating facts\nof charge as defense in ULP proceeding), the argument gets it\nonly half-way to the finish line. It removes one obstacle\u2014the\nGC\u2019s decision not to pursue a supervisory taint complaint\u2014but\nleaves another undisturbed\u2014the fact that Salem already\n\f                                 25\nlitigated\u2014and lost\u2014a question of fact essential to the defense,\nnamely, the CNs\u2019 non-supervisory status.\n\n      Finally, Salem contends that Board precedent permits\nrelitigation here, relying on Sub-Zero Freezer Co., 271 NLRB\n47 (1984) (allowing employer to relitigate pre-election issues\nat ULP proceeding). But, as the Board describes it, Sub-Zero\nis a limited exception. Salem Hosp. Corp., 357 NLRB No.\n119, 2011 WL 5976073 at *1 n.5 (\u201cSub-Zero is one of a limited\nnumber of cases in which the Board has departed from the\n[no-relitigation] rule.\u201d). There, the Board credited allegations\nthat union supporters had threatened the property and lives of\nvoting employees.21 The election was also close\u2014the union\nwon by only two votes. Sub-Zero, 271 NLRB at 47. The\nBoard in Sub-Zero acknowledged its departure from the\ngeneral no-relitigation policy but explained that failure to\nmake an exception there would result in an order \u201crequiring an\nemployer to bargain with a union that has not attained the\nstatus of majority representative from a free and fair election.\u201d\nId.\n\n     Assuming arguendo that the Board erred by not allowing\nSalem to use the Sub-Zero exception, we believe no prejudice\nresulted therefrom. As we have explained, substantial\nevidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the CNs were\nnot supervisors. In addition, Salem had failed to persuade the\nRD that the CNs engaged in any conduct resulting in\nsupervisory taint even if they were in fact supervisors. We\ntherefore conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in\nprohibiting Salem from relitigating supervisory taint.\n\n\n        21\n           In Sub-Zero, the Board incorporated by reference the facts\nset forth in an earlier Board decision. Sub-Zero, 271 NLRB at 47\n(citing 265 NLRB 1521, 1522\u201323 (1982)).\n\f                             26\n                         *   *    *\n\n     The Board\u2019s myriad missteps\u2014its own as well as those of\nits agents\u2014are a cause for concern and we can only hope that\nthis case constitutes an exception to an otherwise robust and\nfaithful adherence to the Board\u2019s own process. See, e.g.,\nMorton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 235 (1974) (\u201c[I]t is incumbent\nupon agencies to follow their own procedures.\u201d).\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we deny Salem\u2019s petition for\nreview and grant the Board\u2019s cross-application for\nenforcement.\n\n                                                 So ordered.\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued September 22, 2015         Decided December 15, 2015\n\n                       No. 11-1466\n\n    SALEM HOSPITAL CORPORATION, DOING BUSINESS AS\n        MEMORIAL HOSPITAL OF SALEM COUNTY,\n                     PETITIONER\n\n                             v.\n\n           NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD,\n                     RESPONDENT\n\n     HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND ALLIED EMPLOYEES,\n                   AFT/AFL-CIO,\n                     INTERVENOR\n\n\n                Consolidated with 12-1009\n\n\n       On Petition for Review and Cross-Application\n                for Enforcement of an Order\n          of the National Labor Relations Board\n\n\n    Kaitlin A.

The thrust of Salem\u2019s petition\nis that the Board\u2019s misapplication of its own adjudicatory\nprocedures denied Salem a fair opportunity to contest the\nbargaining unit\u2019s certification.      Although the Board\u2019s\nproceedings are indeed gaffe-ridden, Salem has failed to\nestablish that it was prejudiced thereby. For the reasons set\nforth below, we deny Salem\u2019s petition for review and grant the\nBoard\u2019s cross-application for enforcement.\n\n                    I. BACKGROUND\n\n     Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or\nAct) provides that employees may \u201cform, join, or assist labor\norganizations, to bargain collectively through representatives\nof their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted\nactivities for the purpose of collective bargaining.\u201d 29 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 157.

For\nexample, the ULP charge is generally filed with the RD of the region\nin which the alleged ULP has occurred or is occurring. 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.10. The RD then investigates to determine whether a\ncomplaint should issue. The investigation may be \u201cas simple as\nascertaining whether certain statements were made . . . .

On May 19, 2010, Health Professionals and Allied\nEmployees AFT, AFL-CIO (HPAE or Union) filed an election\npetition with the Board to represent Salem\u2019s registered nurses.\nThe proposed unit included charge nurses (CNs), who, Salem\nmaintained, were supervisors and thus ineligible for\nrepresentation under the Act. A representation hearing before\nan HO began on June 2, 2010, to create the record on which the\nRD was to determine the CNs\u2019 status and the appropriateness\nof the proposed bargaining unit.\n\n     While the representation hearing was underway, Salem\nfiled a ULP charge against HPAE alleging supervisory taint\nresulting from the involvement of two alleged supervisory CNs\nin the filing of the petition. Upon receiving the charge, the\nRD began a second process to resolve the taint dispute: Salem\nwas directed to provide the RD with evidence regarding the\nCNs\u2019 alleged involvement in the filing, while the record\n\nconduct over the course of protracted contract negotiations violated\n[the Act].\u201d See Nat\u2019l Labor Relations Bd. Casehandling Manual,\nPt. 1, Unfair Labor Practice Proceedings \u00a7 10050 (2015). The\ncharging party must, inter alia, meet with Board agents and comply\nwith any reasonable request necessary to complete the investigation.\nSee id. \u00a7 10054.1. If the charging party delays presentation of\nevidence without cause, the charge is \u201csubject to dismissal for lack\nof cooperation.\u201d Id. If the charging party\u2019s evidence presents a\n\u201cprima facie case,\u201d the charged party \u201cshould be contacted to\nprovide additional and more complete evidence.\u201d               See id.\n\u00a7 10054.4. The RD issues a complaint if \u201cit appears . . . that formal\nproceedings in respect [of the charge] should be instituted\u201d and sets a\nhearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.15. At this point, the GC prosecutes the complaint.\n\f                               7\nregarding the predicate CN supervisory status question was yet\nto be completed by the HO conducting the representation\nhearing.\n\n     Over a one-week period, June 2\u20139, 2010, witnesses for\nboth Salem and the Union testified at the representation\nhearing. Two complications arose. First, Salem moved to\ntransfer the proceeding to another regional office, alleging that\nthe HO had engaged in ex parte communications with certain\nCN witnesses. The motion was denied, first by the HO and,\nultimately, by the GC. Second, Salem requested that the HO\nprepare subpoenas for certain witnesses. Although the HO\nconfirmed that the subpoenas would be prepared, see\nRepresentation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 807 (\u201c[Salem\u2019s Counsel] has\nrequested some subpoenas. They are being prepared.\u201d), he\nclosed the record on the following day over Salem\u2019s objection.\n\n     The RD\u2019s concurrent investigation of Salem\u2019s supervisory\ntaint charge also proved troublesome. Salem missed multiple\ndeadlines to produce witnesses for RD interviews. Moreover,\nthe affidavit evidence it submitted to the RD was deemed\ninsufficient. See Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s Letter of Dismissal 1 (\u201cEven\nassuming that these charge nurses are supervisors within the\nmeaning of . . . the Act, there is insufficient evidence to\nestablish that the charge nurses\u2019 limited prounion activities\ncoerced employees in the exercise of their Section 7 rights.\u201d).\nThe RD then closed the investigation and declined to issue a\ncomplaint. Salem appealed the RD\u2019s decision to the GC but\nits appeal was denied. See Gen. Counsel\u2019s Denial of Hosp.\u2019s\nAppeal of Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s Refusal to Issue Compl.\n\n    On August 2, 2010, using the HO\u2019s record from the\nrepresentation hearing, the RD issued her decision regarding\n\f                                  8\nthe CNs\u2019 supervisory status. She concluded that all but two5\nof Salem\u2019s CNs were not supervisors and issued a \u201cdirection of\nelection.\u201d The election took place on September 1\u20132, 2010.\nSalem challenged the RD\u2019s election order, arguing, inter alia,\nthat the HO\u2019s record closure was premature, repeating its\nallegation of ex parte communications between the HO and\nCN witnesses and claiming that the alleged supervisors tainted\nthe election petition.      The Board denied the petition,\nconcluding that Salem raised no issues warranting review.\nThereafter, the election results were released and revealed that\nthe Union won 73\u201348.\n\n     Salem next moved the RD to set aside the election results,\nraising 20 objections. Objections 1\u201316 tracked the events\nleading up to the election, that is, Salem\u2019s supervisory taint\ncharge and the proceedings resulting in the determination that\nthe CNs were not supervisors. Objections 18\u201320 involved\nallegations of impropriety that occurred during the election.6\nOn January 10, 20117 the RD set a hearing before an HO to\nresolve the objections. The case was then consolidated with a\npending ULP proceeding initiated by the Union and set to be\nheard by an ALJ on February 22.8\n\n\n         5\n         The RD excluded the two nurses from the bargaining unit.\nSee Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s Decision and Direction of Election at 23 n.12.\n         6\n           On December 30, 2010, Salem abandoned Objection 17 by\nletter to the RD.\n         7\n             All subsequent dates occurred in 2011 unless otherwise\nnoted.\n         8\n          The consolidation occurred because there was a pending\nULP complaint against Salem based on charges the Union made. It\nwithdrew the charges before the hearing began. See Union\u2019s Mot.\nfor Special Permission to Appeal at 2 n.5; Salem Hosp.

Seven days later\u2014before Salem\nresponded and on the same day the ALJ began the\nrepresentation hearing\u2014the Board granted the Special Appeal\nand reversed the RD\u2019s decision. Salem filed its response to\nthe Union\u2019s Special Appeal with the Board later that same day.\n\n    Although the Board overturned the RD\u2019s decision to set a\nhearing on Objections 1\u201316, it remanded the Objections to the\nRD for disposition. The RD administratively dismissed them\non February 24. Before the ALJ reached the merits of the\nremaining Objections, Salem made two separate filings with\nthe Board. First, Salem moved for reconsideration of the\nBoard\u2019s grant of the Union\u2019s Special Appeal, arguing that its\nregulations did not allow for the procedure and that, assuming\nthey did, Salem was, at a minimum, entitled to respond.\nSecond, Salem appealed the RD\u2019s administrative dismissal of\nObjections 1\u201316. Before the Board ruled on either motion,\nthe ALJ found against Salem on Objections 18\u201320 and\n\n23, 2011). It is, however, unclear whether Board procedure was\nfollowed when the ALJ continued to hear the representation case.\nBoard rules direct that an HO conduct a hearing on objections to an\nelection. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(d); cf. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(c)(1)(ii)\n(2015) (\u201c[E]xcept that the regional director may consolidate the\nhearing concerning objections and challenges with an unfair labor\npractice proceeding before an administrative law judge.\u201d). By the\ntime the hearing set for February 22nd occurred, the ULP complaint\nhad been withdrawn. The rules authorize the RD to sever a\npreviously consolidated case, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.33(a)(4), (c), and,\npresumably, assign the representation hearing to an HO and the ULP\nproceeding to an ALJ.

On August 3, the Board9 denied\nthe exceptions and certified HPAE as the exclusive collective\nbargaining representative for Salem\u2019s registered nurses\n(including CNs).        The Board also denied Salem\u2019s\nreconsideration motion regarding the Union\u2019s Special Appeal.\nThe Board, however, neglected to dispose of Salem\u2019s appeal of\nthe RD\u2019s administrative dismissal of Objections 1\u201316.\n\n    Salem then refused to recognize or bargain with HPAE\nand, on September 14, the GC filed a ULP complaint alleging\n\n        9\n           Although it is unclear from the record, Salem claims that it\n\u201cfiled with the Board timely Exceptions to [the ALJ\u2019s] decision,\u201d\nPet\u2019r Br. at 14 (emphasis added); Employer\u2019s Br. in Sup. of its\nExceptions to the Rec.

Salem conceded its refusal but raised as\n\u201caffirmative defenses\u201d many of the alleged improprieties that\nplagued the earlier proceedings\u2014specifically, that: (1) the\nBoard should have sustained Salem\u2019s objections to the\nelection; (2) the Board should not have granted the Union\u2019s\nSpecial Appeal; (3) the GC should have transferred the\nrepresentation hearing to another HO; (4) the GC should have\nissued a complaint in connection with Salem\u2019s supervisory\ntaint charge; and (5) the Board impermissibly failed to rule on\nSalem\u2019s appeal of the RD\u2019s dismissal of Objections 1\u201316.\n\n     An ALJ hearing was scheduled for December 14, but, on\nOctober 12, the GC moved for summary judgment before the\nBoard. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.24(a) (summary judgment\nmotion is to be filed with Board). Before ruling on the\nmotion, the Board issued an \u201cerratum\u201d amending its August 3rd\ncertification order. The one-page order acknowledged the\nBoard\u2019s failure to resolve Salem\u2019s appeal of the RD\u2019s\ndismissal of Salem\u2019s Objections 1\u201316 and purported to deny it\nnunc pro tunc. Finally, on November 29 the Board granted\nthe GC\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ULP\ncomplaint, concluding that all of Salem\u2019s defenses either\nwere\u2014or could have been\u2014litigated in the earlier\nproceedings.

CLOSING REPRESENTATION HEARING RECORD\n\n     First, Salem challenges the HO\u2019s closure of the record\nbefore Salem could present evidence supporting its claim\nregarding the CNs\u2019 supervisory taint. The NLRA is largely\nsilent on the gathering and presentation of evidence at a\nrepresentation hearing but the Board has provided substantial\nguidance by regulation. For example, it is the HO\u2019s duty to\n\u201cinquire fully into all matters and issues necessary to obtain a\nfull and complete record.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.64(a). The\nhearing itself is \u201cinvestigatory, intended to make a full record\n\n        10\n           Under recent Board precedent, Salem also challenges the\nvalidity of the regulation\u201429 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.30(a)\u2014pursuant to\nwhich the Union was certified. Because Salem did not press its\nargument in the proceedings before the Board, however, it is\nforfeited. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (\u201cNo objection that has not been\nurged before the Board . . . . shall be considered by the court.\u201d).\nMoreover, we reviewed the challenged regulation in San Miguel\nHosp. Corp. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">697</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.

Before the\nhearing closes, the HO is to ask \u201con the record, whether [the\nparties] have anything further to add.\u201d See id. \u00a7 11240. And\nhe \u201cshall, on the written application of any party, forthwith\nissue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of\nwitnesses.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.66(c) (emphasis added); see also\nid. (\u201cThe Regional Director or the hearing officer . . . shall\nforthwith grant the subpoenas requested.\u201d).11\n\n    The HO\u2019s premature closing of the record was without\nexplanation.    One day after announcing that Salem\u2019s\nrequested subpoenas would issue, he closed the record over\nSalem\u2019s objection. Granted, the HO apparently agreed with\nthe Union that Salem\u2019s requested witnesses were cumulative12\n\n        11\n           The NLRA contains a similar provision. See 29 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 161(1) (Board \u201cshall upon application of any party to such\nproceedings, forthwith issue to such party subp[o]enas requiring the\nattendance and testimony of witnesses\u201d). The Board may revoke a\nsubpoena only if \u201cin its opinion the evidence whose production is\nrequired does not relate to any matter under investigation, or any\nmatter in question in such proceedings, or if in its opinion such\nsubp[o]ena does not describe with sufficient particularity the\nevidence whose production is required.\u201d          Id.

The HO\n\f                                14\nbut that inference is hardly ineluctable. According to the\nrecord, the HO stated only that \u201cthe Employer and the\nPetitioner have had an opportunity to discuss the supervisory\nstatus of the charge nurses\u201d and that he was \u201cnot going to take\nadditional testimony.\u201d Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 916. In\nher decision on the CNs\u2019 supervisory status, the RD also failed\nto explain the HO\u2019s failure to issue the subpoenas.\n\n     Notwithstanding this misstep, the record does not indicate\nthat Salem sought to introduce relevant, non-cumulative\nevidence and, without that, we cannot find that Salem was\nprejudiced.

After the HO predicted that\nthe hearing would conclude within one day, Salem\u2019s counsel\nasserted: \u201cNot if I have anything to do with it. Request for\nsubpoenas, the issuance of subpoenas.\u201d Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at\n805. If this is so, it is indeed regrettable. We have previously\nnoted the sharp practice of Salem\u2019s counsel in proceedings before us\nand do so again here in an effort to stop its repetition. See San\nMiguel Hosp. Corp., 697 F.3d at 1188 (\u201cAs we noted at the outset,\nthe Hospital unleashed a blizzard of arguments to challenge the\nBoard\u2019s unfair-labor-practice orders. It might be appropriate to\nsuggest that in appellate argument, the proverbial rifle is preferable\nto a machine gun\u2014but that would assume petitioner had at least a\nfew good arguments; it did not.

See Reg\u2019l Dir.\u2019s\nDecision and Direction of Election at 17 n.11 (\u201cAt best,\n[Salem] can argue that the evidence is in conflict as to whether\nthe CNs [exercise supervisory authority]. The Board will not\nfind supervisory status in the face of such a conflict.\u201d).\nNonetheless, Salem contends that the excluded testimony\nwould have resolved conflicting evidence tending to show\nnon-supervisory status.15 We do not see how, by introducing\nmore conflicting testimony, Salem could have solved the\nevidentiary conflict.\n\n     Salem relies on our Ozark decision to argue that parties\nhave a right to present all relevant evidence during a\nrepresentation hearing. But Ozark involved substantially\ndifferent facts. There, the employer challenged the Board\u2019s\ncertification because four of its employees allegedly \u201cacted as\nagents of the union.\u201d Ozark, 779 F.3d at 580. In a\npost-election objection hearing, the employer served\nsubpoenas duces tecum on the union and on an employee who,\naccording to the employer, had acted as a union agent. Id. at\n578. Both the union and the employee objected to the\nsubpoenas on the grounds of overbreadth and privilege. Id.\nAfter reserving her ruling on the subpoenas, the HO eventually\ngranted the union\u2019s and the employee\u2019s motions to revoke the\nsubpoenas without examining the documents the employer\nsought. Id. at 578\u201379. We found that the HO\u2019s revocation\naction violated Board procedure. Id. at 581\u201382. The Board\u2019s\nGuide for Hearing Officers in Representation Proceedings\n\u201cstate[d] that when confidentiality or other objections are\nraised to oppose a subpoena . . . the hearing officer should\n\n        15\n           See Pet\u2019r. Br. at 25 (arguing its witnesses would testify\nthat, based on their everyday working relationship with CNs, patient\nassignment was \u201chardly \u2018collaborative\u2019 \u201d).\n\f                                  17\nconsider receiving the material in camera and reviewing the\ndocuments to determine whether redacting certain information\nor narrowing the scope of the subpoena might cure the\nobjection.\u201d Id. at 582. We concluded that the procedural\nflaw prejudiced the employer because establishing that\nemployees acted as union agents was critical to the employer\u2019s\ndefense; in addition, the HO\u2019s delay in ruling on the subpoenas\nincreased the prejudice to the employer because, had the\nemployer known earlier that the subpoenas would be quashed,\nit could have \u201calter[ed] its presentation . . . . All trial lawyers\nknow the danger of the unknown.\u201d Id.\n\n     We are not persuaded by Salem\u2019s attempt to align its case\nwith Ozark. In Ozark we found prejudice based on both the\nrelevant and non-cumulative nature of the evidence sought to\nbe presented and the delay in ruling, which exposed the\nemployer to uncertainty in establishing its defense. Id. at\n582\u201383. By contrast, because Salem failed either to make a\nproffer or to provide any other specific evidence of potential\nwitnesses\u2019 testimony,16 we cannot determine that the excluded\nevidence was either relevant or material.\n\n\n        16\n            At oral argument Salem\u2019s counsel contended that its\nproffer was made orally, see Oral Arg. Recording at 3:30 (\u201cCounsel\nfor the hospital explicitly references the house supervisors and the\nneed, in light of the evidence elicited by the Union . . . to put on the\nhouse supervisors to explain their duties and also to explain the\nillogical position being taken during testimony by the charge\nnurses.\u201d); see also Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 914\u201315 (\u201c[I]t would be\nthe house supervisors\u201d and \u201cit would concern the testimony of [the]\nUnion\u2019s witnesses and embellishment of that position and\ntestimony.\u201d). To the extent we can consider the foregoing a proffer,\nit hardly tells us what the witnesses would testify to, much less how\ntheir testimony could \u201cpersuade to a contrary result,\u201d Reno Hilton\nResorts, 196 F.3d at 1285 n.10, given the Board\u2019s practice of finding\n\f                               18\n    In sum, despite the Board\u2019s unexplained failure to allow a\nparty to submit evidence at a representation hearing, Salem has\nnot, as it must, established prejudice. Accordingly, we\nconclude that the HO\u2019s premature closing of the record was not\nan abuse of discretion.\n\n    B. FAILURE TO TRANSFER FOR ALLEGED EX PARTE\n                  COMMUNICATIONS\n\n    Salem next challenges the GC\u2019s failure, on review from\nthe HO\u2019s similar failure, to transfer the representation hearing\nto another region in light of the alleged ex parte\ncommunications. The Board\u2019s regulations prohibit ex parte\ncommunications.         29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.126(b) (\u201cNo Board\nagent . . . participating in [relevant proceedings], shall . . .\nmake or knowingly cause to be made any prohibited ex parte\ncommunications about the proceeding to any interested person\noutside this agency relevant to the merits of the proceeding.\u201d).\nBoard regulations also grant the GC power to transfer the case\n\u201cin order to effectuate the purposes of the [NLRA].\u201d Id.\n\u00a7 102.33(a).\n\n     The GC\u2019s failure to transfer was reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Salem did not make specific allegations of ex\nparte communications, see Gen. Counsel\u2019s Denial of Hosp.\u2019s\nMot. to Transfer at 2 (July 27, 2010) (\u201cInitially, outside of\nunsubstantiated claims, your communication references no\nevidence of such ex parte meetings.\u201d), and the GC\u2019s own\ninvestigation found that \u201cneither the Hearing Officer nor his\nsupervisor engaged in any.\u201d Id. In fact, the \u201cHearing\nOfficer\u2019s contact with the Employer\u2019s nurses, except for an\n\n\n\nagainst supervisory status if there is conflicting evidence.   See\nPhelps Cmty. Med. Ctr., 295 NLRB at 490.\n\f                               19\noccasional pleasantry, was limited to those times when they\nwere testifying on the record.\u201d Id.\n\n     Salem faults the GC for failing to request its evidence of\nex parte communications but cites no regulation or policy that\nrequires the GC to affirmatively seek evidence. Moreover,\nSalem had the opportunity to present its evidence, both in its\npetition for transfer before the GC and in its earlier motion\nbefore the HO. But the petition contained only conclusory\nassertions, see Salem\u2019s Mot. to Transfer at 1 n.1 (\u201cIt was\napparent during the hearing (specifically on June 4, 2010)\nthat . . . [the HO] had met privately with the Union\u2019s two\nattorneys and at least [one CN] . . . regarding various issues\nrelated to the petition.\u201d), and the same was true at the hearing.\nSee Representation Hr\u2019g Tr. at 618 (\u201cI would imagine that\nthere are Board agents . . . who are bound by certain ethical\nconsideration, in terms of meeting with a supervisor of this\nEmployer in my absence. And I just want the Regional Office\nto understand, if that is something which is in play here . . . I\nwould recommend that serious thought be given to whether or\nnot to modify that behavior.\u201d).\n\n     In any event, Salem does not claim that it was prejudiced\nby the decision not to transfer.          Indeed, \u201cex parte\ncommunications, even when undisclosed during agency\nproceedings, do not necessarily void an agency decision.\u201d\nProf\u2019l Air Traffic Controllers Org. v. FLRA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407565\"><a href=\"/opinion/407565/professional-air-traffic-controllers-organization-v-federal-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564\n(D.C.

Rather, a party must show that \u201cas a result\nof improper ex parte communications, the agency\u2019s\ndecisionmaking process was irrevocably tainted.\u201d            Id.\nBecause Salem has not shown prejudice, we conclude that\nneither the HO nor the GC abused his discretion.17\n\n       17\n         In its brief Salem argued that the alleged ex parte\ncommunications meant that the HO had prejudged the CNs\u2019 status.\n\f                                 20\n                 C. UNION\u2019S SPECIAL APPEAL\n\n     Salem makes two arguments regarding the Union\u2019s\nSpecial Appeal of the RD\u2019s decision to set a hearing on\nSalem\u2019s Objections 1\u201316. First, Salem asserts that no Board\nrule permits such an appeal. Second, it objects to the Board\u2019s\nfailure, in any event, to allow Salem to respond. The Board\u2019s\nerrors are not insignificant but, again, prejudice to Salem is\nlacking.\n\n     The Special Appeal was undoubtedly unauthorized. The\nUnion relied on 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.26 to press its Special Appeal\nbut that rule governs appeals in unfair labor practices\nproceedings. The Board asserts that another rule\u201429 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.65(c)\u2014permits the appeal. Even if the Board is correct,\nit misapplied the rule here.\n\n    At the time the Union made its Special Appeal, Section\n102.65(c) provided that\n\n        Requests to the regional director, or to the\n        Board in appropriate cases, for special\n        permission to appeal from a ruling of the\n        hearing officer, together with the appeal from\n        such ruling, shall be filed promptly, in writing,\n\nIts argument does not support a prejudice finding given that the\nRD\u2014not the HO\u2014makes the status determination. See 29 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 102.67 (directing that RD, not HO, render a decision). Salem also\nargued that, in order to protect the HO, the RD had an improper\nincentive to find no supervisory status. We reject this conclusory\nassertion. Cf. Withrow v. Larkin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109237\"><a href=\"/opinion/109237/withrow-v-larkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 55 (1975) (\u201cWithout\na showing to the contrary, [government actors] are assumed to be\nmen of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a\nparticular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.\u201d)\n(internal quotations omitted).\n\f                                 21\n        and shall briefly state (1) the reasons special\n        permission should be granted and (2) the\n        grounds relied on for the appeal. . . . Any\n        statement in opposition or other response to the\n        request and/or to the appeal shall be filed\n        promptly.\n\n(emphasis added). 18 Section 102.65(c) gave the Board\nconsiderable discretion in its implementation, viz., special\nappeals to the Board were permitted \u201cin appropriate cases.\u201d\n29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.65(c). But the Board could not explain at oral\nargument why this was an \u201cappropriate case,\u201d see Oral Arg.\nRecording at 23:34\u201325:15 (\u201cI do not think it is\nunprecedented . . . . I could try to find out for you.\u201d). 19\nMoreover, the Board\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfiled promptly\u201d here\nis inconsistent at best. The Board heard the Union\u2019s Special\nAppeal even though it was filed more than one month after the\nRD decision setting a hearing. If the Union\u2019s filing was\nprompt, then Salem\u2019s response within one week was\nalacritous. Yet the Board gave one party over one month to\n\n        18\n            The highlighted language has since been deleted.\nSection 102.65(c) now provides: \u201cRequests to the regional director\nfor special permission to appeal from a ruling of the hearing officer,\ntogether with the appeal from such ruling, shall be filed promptly, in\nwriting, and shall briefly state the reasons special permission should\nbe granted and the grounds relied on for the appeal. . . . Any\nstatement in opposition or other response to the request and/or to the\nappeal shall be filed promptly, in writing, and shall be served\nimmediately on the other parties and on the regional director.\u201d\n        19\n           If not unprecedented, the Board has apparently expanded\nthe scope of section 102.65(c) by allowing special appeals from an\nRD decision although special appeals were (and are) limited to \u201ca\nruling of the hearing officer.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.65(c); see also 29\nC.F.R. \u00a7 102.65(c) (2015).\n\f                                22\nfile without allowing the other side so much as a week to\nrespond.\n\n     Nonetheless, Salem once again cannot establish that the\nBoard\u2019s mistake prejudiced it. Salem asserts that, by granting\nthe Union\u2019s Special Appeal and reversing the RD\u2019s decision\nsetting a hearing, it was stripped of its ability to argue the\nmerits of Objections 1\u201316 to the ALJ. Although true, Salem\nwas not prejudiced thereby for at least three reasons. First,\nObjections 1\u201316 related to the CNs\u2019 supervisory status, an\nissue that had already been litigated before the Board. Even if\nSalem were allowed to make its arguments to the ALJ, we see\nno reason that the ALJ would have reached a conclusion\ncontrary to that of the Board. Second, if Salem were for some\nreason successful before the ALJ, the Board reviews his\ndecisions and the Board had already determined that Salem\u2019s\nobjections constituted prohibited relitigation.20 Finally, if the\nprocedural error did prejudice Salem, the prejudice was cured\nwhen the Board considered Salem\u2019s motion for\nreconsideration. Before certifying the Union, the Board\nreconsidered its earlier order\u2014this time with the benefit of\nSalem\u2019s response\u2014and reached the same conclusion.\n\n              D. BOARD\u2019S \u201cERRATUM\u201d ORDER\n\n    Salem next questions the propriety of the Board\u2019s\nErratum, which redressed the latter\u2019s failure to timely rule on\n\n        20\n           See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69(d) (directing that hearing be held\nonly if there are \u201csubstantial and material factual issues\u201d). The\nUnion argued that Objections 1\u201316 did not meet this requirement\nbecause they were already \u201cdecided by the RD in the [decision and\ndirection of election], concerning which review was denied by the\nBoard,\u201d Union\u2019s Mot. for Special Permission to Appeal at 2, and the\nBoard agreed. See NLRB Order Granting Mot. for Special\nPermission to Appeal at 2.\n\f                                23\nSalem\u2019s appeal of the RD\u2019s administrative dismissal of\nObjections 1\u201316. But the Board had already determined that\nSalem\u2019s Objections 1\u201316 were meritless. It did so both when\nit denied Salem\u2019s petition for review of the RD\u2019s direction of\nelection and when it granted the Union\u2019s Special Appeal.\nSalem does not explain how the Board\u2019s issuance of the\nerratum was ultra vires or how the order prejudiced it.\n\n    E. BOARD\u2019S DENIAL OF SALEM\u2019S DEFENSE TO ULP\n                     CHARGE\n\n      Salem\u2019s final salvo is that the Board prevented it from\nlitigating supervisory taint as a defense to the ULP charge.\nWe do not see how Salem could establish taint without\nrelitigating the predicate supervisory question but it\nnonetheless maintains that the Board should have permitted it\nto make the argument as a defense in the ULP proceeding.\n\n     Board regulations generally prohibit\u2014in ULP\nproceedings\u2014relitigation of matters that arose at the earlier\nrepresentation proceeding stage. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.67(f)\n(\u201c[This rule] shall preclude . . . parties from relitigating, in any\nrelated subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding, any issue\nwhich was, or could have been, raised in the representation\nproceeding.\u201d (emphasis added)). We have upheld the rule,\nsee Pace Univ. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23\u201324 (D.C.

See Joseph T.\nRyerson & Sons, Inc. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185236\"><a href=\"/opinion/185236/joseph-t-ryerson-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1151 (D.C.

Relitigation is also\npermitted if subsequent legal authority changes the relevant\nlaw. See Alois Box Co. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185176\"><a href=\"/opinion/185176/alois-box-co-inc-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (D.C.

Again, we review\napplication of the Board\u2019s no-relitigation rule for abuse of\ndiscretion. See Pace Univ., 514 F.3d at 24.\n\n     The relitigation ban plainly applied to Salem. Salem had\nalready raised the CNs\u2019 supervisory status issue in the\nrepresentation proceeding and lost. It was also unsuccessful\nin pursuing its supervisory taint charge. Salem nonetheless\nmakes three arguments in favor of relitigation. First, Salem\nrecycles the argument about its inability to present supervisory\nstatus evidence at the representation hearing. We resolved\nthis issue at the representation hearing level, see supra part\nII.A, and Salem offers no reason for us to reconsider it at the\nULP stage. Next, Salem contends that parties in ULP\nproceedings are guaranteed the right to raise affirmative\ndefenses, notwithstanding the GC considered the facts\nsupporting the defense in the context of a potential charge and\ndeclined to issue a complaint. Although Salem is correct, see\nUnited Food and Commercial Workers v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402320\"><a href=\"/opinion/402320/united-food-and-commercial-workers-international-union-local-no-576/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n354\u201355 (D.C.

It removes one obstacle\u2014the\nGC\u2019s decision not to pursue a supervisory taint complaint\u2014but\nleaves another undisturbed\u2014the fact that Salem already\n\f                                 25\nlitigated\u2014and lost\u2014a question of fact essential to the defense,\nnamely, the CNs\u2019 non-supervisory status.\n\n      Finally, Salem contends that Board precedent permits\nrelitigation here, relying on Sub-Zero Freezer Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">47</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984) (allowing employer to relitigate pre-election issues\nat ULP proceeding).

Sub-Zero, 271 NLRB at 47. The\nBoard in Sub-Zero acknowledged its departure from the\ngeneral no-relitigation policy but explained that failure to\nmake an exception there would result in an order \u201crequiring an\nemployer to bargain with a union that has not attained the\nstatus of majority representative from a free and fair election.\u201d\nId.\n\n     Assuming arguendo that the Board erred by not allowing\nSalem to use the Sub-Zero exception, we believe no prejudice\nresulted therefrom. As we have explained, substantial\nevidence supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that the CNs were\nnot supervisors. In addition, Salem had failed to persuade the\nRD that the CNs engaged in any conduct resulting in\nsupervisory taint even if they were in fact supervisors. We\ntherefore conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in\nprohibiting Salem from relitigating supervisory taint.\n\n\n        21\n           In Sub-Zero, the Board incorporated by reference the facts\nset forth in an earlier Board decision.
