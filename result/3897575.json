Section<cross_reference>669.003</cross_reference> of the Government Code provides in pertinent part that a state agency \"may not enter into a contract with the executive head of the state agency\" unless its governing body (i) votes to approve the contract in an open meeting, and (ii) notifies the Legislative Budget Board of the terms of the proposed contract not later than the fifth day before the date of the vote. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. &#167; <cross_reference>669.003</cross_reference>(1)-(2) (Vernon Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p>Because chapter 669 defines the term \"state agency\" by reference to section <cross_reference>572.002</cross_reference> of the Government Code, <em>see</em> <em>id</em>. &#167; 669.001(2), you first ask if a river authority falls under that provision's definition of state agency. <em>See</em> Request Letter, <em>supra</em> note 1, at 1. Second, and more specifically, you ask if a river authority must comply with the section 669.003(2) notice requirement. <em>See</em><em>id</em>.</p>\n<p>In construing these provisions, we attempt to give effect to the legislature's intent. <em>See Mitchell Energy Corp. v.
