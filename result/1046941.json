In order to determine the reasonableness of an award of attorney\nfees, the Tennessee Supreme Court has directed trial courts to consider a number of factors:\n\n       (1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions\n       involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;\n       (2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the\n       particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;\n       (3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;\n       (4) The amount involved and the results obtained;\n       (5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances\n       (6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n       (7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing\n       the services;\n       (8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent;\n\f        (9) Prior advertisements or statements by the lawyer with respect to the fees\n        the lawyer charges; and\n        (10) Whether the fee agreement is in writing.\n\nWright v.

R. 8, RPC 1.5).\n\n       While every factor may not be relevant in every case, see Wright, 337 S.W.3d at 177\nn.21, the trial court should consider each relevant factor when determining an attorney\u2019s\nreasonable fee. Id. at 185 (\u201c[T]he trial court should apply the factors set forth in RPC\n1.5(a)(1)\u2013(10) when determining a reasonable attorney's fee regardless of the client's age.\u201d).\nRather than utilizing the above factors, the trial court apparently based the attorney fee\naward on Rules 33.04 and 33.05 of the 22nd Judicial District Local Rules of Practice (\u201cthe\nLocal Rules\u201d). I agree with the majority that the determination of reasonable attorney fees\nshould not be governed by the Local Rules, but rather should be based on the factors as\noutlined in Wright. Instead of remanding to the trial court to consider Mr. Colley\u2019s\nreasonable attorney fee in light of the proper standard, the majority concludes that based on\nthe evidence in the record, Mr. Colley is entitled to a fee of $ 8,000.00.\n\n        However, I write to voice my concern regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to comport\nwith the Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s directions in Wright, which hinders our ability to\nproperly consider this appeal.

From my review of the record, no evidentiary hearing was ever conducted as to the\nreasonableness of Mr. Colley\u2019s fee.

Accordingly,\nWright requires that the trial court must consider the relevant factors in awarding reasonable\nattorney fees and both Wright and Rule 52.01 impose a mandatory duty on the trial court\nto make express findings as to those factors.

However, I must\nreiterate that without findings under Rule 52.01, it is not \u201cthe obligation of this Court to\nscrutinize the transcript, in order to discern a trial court's reasoning.\u201d Grand Valley Lakes\nProperty Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. Burrow, No. W2011-00573-COA-R3C, 2011 WL 6916477,\nat *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2011). In addition, I must caution that \u201cwhile in this case we\nchose to proceed with our review despite the fact that the [court] chose not to abide by the\nrules of this Court, we cannot say we will be so accommodating and choose to do the same\nin the future.\u201d Wells v. Wells, No. W2009\u201301600\u2013COA\u2013R3\u2013CV, 2010 WL 891885, *4\n(Tenn. Ct. App. 2010).\n\n       For this reason, I respectfully file this separate concurrence.\n\n\n\n                                                  _________________________________\n                                                  J.
