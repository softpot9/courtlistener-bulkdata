S TEVEN S TAFFORD, J., concurring.\n\n       I concur in both the reasoning and the result reached by the majority in this case, but\nwrite separately to voice my concern over the lack of findings made by the trial court.\n\n       I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the prohibition against clearly excessive\nfees expressed in White v. McBride, 937 S.W.2d 796 (Tenn. 1996), applies to the fee\nrequested in this case.\n\n      I agree also with the majority\u2019s conclusion that, although Mr. Colley\u2019s fee request\nwas not reasonable, it was not so clearly excessive as to deny him any fee pursuant to White.\nAs such, I agree that Mr. Colley is entitled to his reasonable fee in quantum meruit.\n\n        The majority then goes on to consider the reasonable fee that should be awarded to\nMr. Colley in this case. In order to determine the reasonableness of an award of attorney\nfees, the Tennessee Supreme Court has directed trial courts to consider a number of factors:\n\n       (1) The time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions\n       involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly;\n       (2) The likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the\n       particular employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;\n       (3) The fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;\n       (4) The amount involved and the results obtained;\n       (5) The time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances\n       (6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n       (7) The experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing\n       the services;\n       (8) Whether the fee is fixed or contingent;\n\f        (9) Prior advertisements or statements by the lawyer with respect to the fees\n        the lawyer charges; and\n        (10) Whether the fee agreement is in writing.\n\nWright v. Wright, 337 S.W.3d 166, 176 (Tenn. 2011) (internal citations omitted) (quoting\nTenn. Sup. Ct. R. 8, RPC 1.5).\n\n       While every factor may not be relevant in every case, see Wright, 337 S.W.3d at 177\nn.21, the trial court should consider each relevant factor when determining an attorney\u2019s\nreasonable fee. Id. at 185 (\u201c[T]he trial court should apply the factors set forth in RPC\n1.5(a)(1)\u2013(10) when determining a reasonable attorney's fee regardless of the client's age.\u201d).\nRather than utilizing the above factors, the trial court apparently based the attorney fee\naward on Rules 33.04 and 33.05 of the 22nd Judicial District Local Rules of Practice (\u201cthe\nLocal Rules\u201d). I agree with the majority that the determination of reasonable attorney fees\nshould not be governed by the Local Rules, but rather should be based on the factors as\noutlined in Wright. Instead of remanding to the trial court to consider Mr. Colley\u2019s\nreasonable attorney fee in light of the proper standard, the majority concludes that based on\nthe evidence in the record, Mr. Colley is entitled to a fee of $ 8,000.00.\n\n        However, I write to voice my concern regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to comport\nwith the Tennessee Supreme Court\u2019s directions in Wright, which hinders our ability to\nproperly consider this appeal. The Wright Court directed that \u201cthe trial court should develop\nan evidentiary record, make findings concerning each of the factors, and then determine a\nreasonable fee that \u201cdepend[s] upon the particular circumstances of the individual case.\u201d1\nId. at 185\u201386 (emphasis added) (quoting White v. McBride, 937 S.W.2d 796, 800 (Tenn.\n1996)). From my review of the record, no evidentiary hearing was ever conducted as to the\nreasonableness of Mr. Colley\u2019s fee. In addition, the order granting Mr. Colley\u2019s request for\nan attorney fee contains no express consideration of any of the above factors, in\ncontravention of both the Wright decision and Rule 52.01 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Rule 52.01 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n        In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury, the court shall find the facts\n        specially and shall state separately its conclusions of law and direct the entry\n        of the appropriate judgment. The findings of a master, to the extent that the\n        court adopts them, shall be considered as the findings of the court. If an\n        opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the\n\n        1\n          Although Wright dealt specifically with attorney fees in cases involving minors, the Court\nemphasized that the rules governing reasonable attorney fees apply equally to cases involving adults. See\nWright, 337 S.W3d at 177.\n\n                                                   2\n\f       findings of fact and conclusions of law appear therein.\n\nId.\n\n         This Court has previously held that the General Assembly\u2019s decision to require\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law is \u201cnot a mere technicality.\u201d In re K.H., No.\nW2008-01144-COA-R3-PT, 2009 WL 1362314, at *8 (Tenn. Ct. App. May 15, 2009).\nInstead, the requirement serves the important purpose of \u201cfacilitat[ing] appellate review and\npromot[ing] the just and speedy resolution of appeals.\u201d Id.; White v. Moody, 171 S.W.3d\n187, 191 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004); Bruce v. Bruce, 801 S.W.2d 102, 104 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n1990). \u201cWithout such findings and conclusions, this court is left to wonder on what basis\nthe court reached its ultimate decision.\u201d In re K.H., 2009 WL 1362314, at *8 (quoting In\nre M.E.W., No. M2003-01739-COA-R3-PT, 2004 WL 865840, at *19 (Tenn. Ct. App.\nApril 21, 2004)). Indeed, specifically in cases involving attorney fees, the Tennessee\nSupreme Court has held that \u201c[t]o enable appellate review, trial courts should clearly and\nthoroughly explain the particular circumstances and factors supporting their determination\nof a reasonable fee in a given case.\u201d Wright, 337 S.W.3d at 186. \u201cWhere, however, there\nis . . . no way to ascertain whether the court made the award in light of the appropriate\nfactors, there is no way for us to accord the normal deference to the trial court.\u201d First\nPeoples Bank of Tenn. v. Hill, 340 S.W.3d 398, 410 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2010) (citing Jerry\nT. Beech Concrete Contractor, Inc., v. Larry Powell Builders, Inc., No. M2001-02709-\nCOV-R3-CV, 2003 WL 726955, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App. March 4, 2003)). Accordingly,\nWright requires that the trial court must consider the relevant factors in awarding reasonable\nattorney fees and both Wright and Rule 52.01 impose a mandatory duty on the trial court\nto make express findings as to those factors. Neither requirement was complied with in this\ncase.\n\n       The appropriate remedy when a trial court fails to make appropriate findings of fact\nand conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52.01 is to \u201cvacate the trial court's judgment and\nremand the cause to the trial court for written findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d Lake\nv. Haynes, No. W2010\u201300294\u2013COA\u2013R3\u2013CV, 2011 WL 2361563, at *1 (Tenn. Ct. App.\nJune 9, 2011). While I stress the importance of these findings to enable this Court to conduct\na thorough appellate review, this Court has previously held that when faced with a trial\ncourt\u2019s failure to make specific findings, the appellate courts may \u201csoldier on\u201d when the case\ninvolves only a clear legal issue, Burse v. Hicks, No. W2007\u201302848\u2013COA\u2013R3\u2013CV, 2008\nWL 4414718, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Sept. 30, 2008), or when the court\u2019s decision is \u201creadily\nascertainable.\u201d Burgess v. Kone, Inc., No. M2007\u20130259\u2013COA\u2013R3\u2013CV, 2008 WL 2796409,\nat * (Tenn. Ct. App. July 18, 2008). In this case, the only issue on appeal is the reasonable\nattorney fee owed to Mr. Colley. In the trial court, Mr. Colley filed invoices containing the\nnumber of hours he worked on this case, as well as his normal hourly fee, which are\n\n                                              3\n\fcontained in the record on appeal. In this situation, despite the lack of Rule 52.01 findings,\nwe may soldier on to determine Mr. Colley\u2019s reasonable fee in quantum meruit. The\nmajority has indeed reviewed the record and determined that Mr. Colley is entitled to a\nreasonable fee of $ 8,000.00, based on the invoices submitted to the trial court and the\nfactors as outlined in Wright. I concur in the result reached by the majority. However, I must\nreiterate that without findings under Rule 52.01, it is not \u201cthe obligation of this Court to\nscrutinize the transcript, in order to discern a trial court's reasoning.\u201d Grand Valley Lakes\nProperty Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. Burrow, No. W2011-00573-COA-R3C, 2011 WL 6916477,\nat *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. Dec. 28, 2011). In addition, I must caution that \u201cwhile in this case we\nchose to proceed with our review despite the fact that the [court] chose not to abide by the\nrules of this Court, we cannot say we will be so accommodating and choose to do the same\nin the future.\u201d Wells v. Wells, No. W2009\u201301600\u2013COA\u2013R3\u2013CV, 2010 WL 891885, *4\n(Tenn. Ct.

From my review of the record, no evidentiary hearing was ever conducted as to the\nreasonableness of Mr. Colley\u2019s fee. In addition, the order granting Mr. Colley\u2019s request for\nan attorney fee contains no express consideration of any of the above factors, in\ncontravention of both the Wright decision and Rule 52.01 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Rule 52.01 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n        In all actions tried upon the facts without a jury, the court shall find the facts\n        specially and shall state separately its conclusions of law and direct the entry\n        of the appropriate judgment. The findings of a master, to the extent that the\n        court adopts them, shall be considered as the findings of the court. If an\n        opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the\n\n        1\n          Although Wright dealt specifically with attorney fees in cases involving minors, the Court\nemphasized that the rules governing reasonable attorney fees apply equally to cases involving adults.

Indeed, specifically in cases involving attorney fees, the Tennessee\nSupreme Court has held that \u201c[t]o enable appellate review, trial courts should clearly and\nthoroughly explain the particular circumstances and factors supporting their determination\nof a reasonable fee in a given case.\u201d Wright, 337 S.W.3d at 186. \u201cWhere, however, there\nis . . . no way to ascertain whether the court made the award in light of the appropriate\nfactors, there is no way for us to accord the normal deference to the trial court.\u201d First\nPeoples Bank of Tenn. v.

Accordingly,\nWright requires that the trial court must consider the relevant factors in awarding reasonable\nattorney fees and both Wright and Rule 52.01 impose a mandatory duty on the trial court\nto make express findings as to those factors. Neither requirement was complied with in this\ncase.\n\n       The appropriate remedy when a trial court fails to make appropriate findings of fact\nand conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52.01 is to \u201cvacate the trial court's judgment and\nremand the cause to the trial court for written findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d Lake\nv.

While I stress the importance of these findings to enable this Court to conduct\na thorough appellate review, this Court has previously held that when faced with a trial\ncourt\u2019s failure to make specific findings, the appellate courts may \u201csoldier on\u201d when the case\ninvolves only a clear legal issue, Burse v.

Ct. App. July 18, 2008). In this case, the only issue on appeal is the reasonable\nattorney fee owed to Mr. Colley. In the trial court, Mr. Colley filed invoices containing the\nnumber of hours he worked on this case, as well as his normal hourly fee, which are\n\n                                              3\n\fcontained in the record on appeal. In this situation, despite the lack of Rule 52.01 findings,\nwe may soldier on to determine Mr. Colley\u2019s reasonable fee in quantum meruit. The\nmajority has indeed reviewed the record and determined that Mr. Colley is entitled to a\nreasonable fee of $ 8,000.00, based on the invoices submitted to the trial court and the\nfactors as outlined in Wright. I concur in the result reached by the majority. However, I must\nreiterate that without findings under Rule 52.01, it is not \u201cthe obligation of this Court to\nscrutinize the transcript, in order to discern a trial court's reasoning.\u201d Grand Valley Lakes\nProperty Owners Ass'n, Inc. v.

In addition, I must caution that \u201cwhile in this case we\nchose to proceed with our review despite the fact that the [court] chose not to abide by the\nrules of this Court, we cannot say we will be so accommodating and choose to do the same\nin the future.\u201d Wells v.
