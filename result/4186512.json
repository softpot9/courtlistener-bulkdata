See\n\nMem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Oral Examination of J. Debtor Timothy Day & Third\n\nParties, & for Leave to Serve Subpoenas [Dkt. # 88-1].

In his opposition, LeFande asserted his\n\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and he also asserted that any testimony would\n\nbe covered by the attorney-client privilege. Id.\n\n       In an opinion dated June 2, 2017, the Magistrate Judge granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for the\n\nissuance of a subpoena, denied LeFande\u2019s motion for a protective order, and stayed the request for\n\na show cause order.

The\n\nMagistrate Judge concluded that LeFande\u2019s assertions of privilege were premature because\n\nLeFande would be required to assert the attorney-client and fifth-amendment privileges on a\n\nquestion-by-question basis. Id. at 8\u20139. On June 16, 2017, LeFande filed objections to the\n\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s order, and he renewed his request for a protective order.

But it appears to be a matter of first impression in this\njurisdiction whether a Magistrate Judge has the power to resolve post-judgment discovery issues.\nIn the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636, Congress gave magistrate judges the authority\n\u201cto hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), and\nit also empowered district judges to assign to magistrate judges any \u201csuch additional duties as are\nnot inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d Id. \u00a7 636(b)(3). Leading\ncommenters have concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the power of Magistrate\nJudges \u201c[c]ertainly . . . can reach the assignment under section 636(b)(3) of posttrial matters\ncomparable in importance to those section 636(b)(1) authorizes a magistrate judge to address\nbefore trial.\u201d 12 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 3068.1 (2d ed. 1995);\n14 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 72.02 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) (\u201cDiscovery is a nondispositive\npretrial matter that may be referred for disposition to a magistrate judge. Postjudgment discovery\nin collection proceedings may also be referred to a magistrate judge.\u201d). Because the management\nof post-judgment discovery is comparable in importance to the management of pretrial discovery,\nthe Court will review the Magistrate Judge\u2019s opinion under the \u201cclear error\u201d standard. The Court\nnotes, however, that its decision would be the same whether it used the \u201cclear error\u201d standard, or\nwhether it reviewed the Magistrate Judge\u2019s opinion de novo \u2013 there is ample support in the record,\nwhich the Court has reviewed in its entirety, for the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusions.\n                                                  4\n\f                                           ANALYSIS\n\n       LeFande challenges the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling on two grounds: first, he argues that any\n\ntestimony that would be sought from him would be protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination, and second, he contends that any testimony would be protected by\n\nattorney-client privilege. Because LeFande cannot assert these privileges to bar all questioning,\n\nthe Court will overrule the objections.\n\nI.     LeFande must assert the self-incrimination privilege on a question-by-question basis.\n       LeFande argued before the Magistrate Judge that he would refuse to answer any questions\n\nabout the St. Mary\u2019s County transaction, and he cited his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\n\nincrimination. LeFande\u2019s Opp. at 7. The Magistrate Judge concluded that LeFande\u2019s blanket\n\nassertion of the self-incrimination privilege was premature. The Magistrate Judge held:\n\n               [N]o authority supports the proposition that the threat by a witness to claim\n               such privileges is a basis upon which to preclude the issuance of a subpoena.\n               Rather, the applicable authorities require that claims of such privileges be\n               made in response to a specific question or questions actually posed, or\n               specific documents actually requested.\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s Opinion at 8\u20139. While LeFande asserts that \u201cthere are no questions the attorney\n\nwill answer without asserting the [Fifth Amendment] privilege,\u201d LeFande Obj. at 9, he does not\n\nargue that the Magistrate Judge erred in any way. Because the Court agrees with the Magistrate\n\nJudge\u2019s conclusion, LeFande\u2019s objection will be overruled.\n\n       The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be\n\na witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. The privilege \u201ccan be asserted in any\n\nproceeding, civil or criminal . . . and it protects any disclosures which the witness reasonably\n\nbelieves could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so\n\nused.\u201d Kastigar v.

In short, the privilege covers\n\ncommunications, and not all acts undertaken on behalf of a client, and it does not cover\n\ncommunications that the attorney had with third parties.\n\n        The attorney-client privilege is \u201cnarrowly construed by the D.C.

Cir. 1998).\n\n        To support his blanket assertion of attorney-client privilege, LeFande relies on the Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s decision in United States v. Zolin, but that case is largely irrelevant to this dispute. See\n\nLeFande Obj. at 12. In Zolin, the Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether a district\n\ncourt could review documents in camera to determine whether those documents were privileged,\n\nor whether they were subject to the crime-fraud exception. Zolin, 491 U.S. at 556\u201357. The\n\nSupreme Court looked to Federal Rules of Evidence 104(a) and 1101(c), 4 and it concluded that it\n\ncould \u201cnot interpret Rule 104(a) as categorically prohibiting the party opposing the privilege on\n\ncrime-fraud grounds from relying on the results of an in camera review of the communications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n4        Rule 104(a) provides that \u201c[p]reliminary questions concerning . . . the existence of a\nprivilege . . . shall be determined by the court,\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 104(a), and Rule 1101(c) provides\nthat \u201c[t]he rule with respect to privileges applies at all stages of all actions, cases, and proceedings.\u201d\nFed. R. Evid. 1101(c).\n\n                                                    8\n\fId. at 568. But no party has asked the Court to review documents in camera to establish whether\n\nthe elements of the crime-fraud exception have been met, so Zolin is inapposite. 5\n\n       It would not invade the attorney client privilege to ask Mr. LeFande about his alleged role\n\nin the transfer of funds to New Zealand and any actions he took or instructions he provided to third\n\nparties to that end. Because the deposition will not necessarily inquire into privileged matters, and\n\nbecause the Court finds no clear error in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling requiring LeFande to sit for\n\na deposition and assert any applicable privileges in response to particular questions, as appropriate,\n\nLeFande\u2019s objections will be overruled. 6\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       For those reasons, it is hereby\n\n       ORDERED that Matthew LeFande\u2019s objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Opinion are\n\nOVERRULED.\n\n       SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                               AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                               United States District Judge\nDATE: July 14, 2017\n\n\n\n5        LeFande also argues that it would \u201coffend[] Rule 1\u201d of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\nto sit for a deposition at which he will \u201crecite the same objections,\u201d and thereafter be brought \u201cback\nto the Court for consideration of the very same privileges already asserted herein.\u201d LeFande\u2019s\nObj. at 12. But the law does not permit LeFande to make a blanket assertion of privilege, and the\nCourt will be in a better position to determine whether particular questions call for privileged\nresponses when it has the precise questions before it.\n\n6      LeFande also raises equitable concerns as to whether post-judgment discovery on the St.\nMary\u2019s County matter is appropriate. LeFande\u2019s Opp. at 15\u201316. The Court referred the post-\njudgment discovery matters to the Magistrate Judge, Order [Dkt. # 90] (Apr. 5, 2016); Order [Dkt.\n# 95] (June 29, 2016), so those concerns are better directed at the Magistrate Judge in the first\ninstance.\n                                                  9\n\f</pre>", "Case_Text": "                       UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                       FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n____________________________________\n                                     )\nDISTRICT TITLE,                      )\n                                     )\n                  Plaintiff,        )\n                                     )\n      v.                            )   Civil Action No. 14-1808 (ABJ)\n                                     )\nANITA K.

Warren promptly transferred the funds to her son Timothy Day, and the two refused to\n\ngive the money back. See District Title v. Warren, No. 14-1808, 2015 WL 7180200, at *1 (D.D.C.\n\nNov. 13, 2015). On November 13, 2015, the Court granted summary judgment to plaintiff on a\n\nbreach of contract count brought against Warren and an unjust enrichment count brought against\n\nDay. See id. The Court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $293,514.44, plus\n\npre-and-post judgment interest and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and it also entered a permanent\n\ninjunction to enjoin defendants from dissipating their assets until the judgment was satisfied.\n\nOrder (Nov. 13, 2015) [Dkt. # 79]; see also Order (Aug. 3, 2016) [Dkt. # 100] (amending the\n\nNovember 13, 2015 order to correct a clerical error).

May 4,\n\n2016).\n\f       On March 22, 2016, plaintiff filed a motion to conduct post-judgment discovery related to\n\nits efforts to collect on the judgment; it sought to depose Day, 1 and it sought court permission to\n\nserve subpoenas on three individuals, including counsel for defendants, Matthew LeFande. See\n\nMem. of P. & A. in Supp. of Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Oral Examination of J. Debtor Timothy Day & Third\n\nParties, & for Leave to Serve Subpoenas [Dkt. # 88-1]. Plaintiff asserted that it sought to issue a\n\nsubpoena on LeFande because he \u201cmay have information concerning assets held or transferred by\n\nTimothy Day.\u201d Id. at 5.\n\n       The Court referred the motion to a Magistrate Judge pursuant to Local Civil Rule 72.2(a).\n\nOrder (Apr. 5, 2016) [Dkt. # 90]. Thereafter, the Court referred another post-judgment discovery\n\nmatter to the same Magistrate Judge. See Order (June 29, 2016) [Dkt. # 95] (referring plaintiff\u2019s\n\nmotion for the issuance of Letters Rogatory to the Auckland High Court in Auckland, New\n\nZealand); Mem. Op. & Order [Dkt. # 104] (granting the motion for the issuance of Letters\n\nRogatory).\n\n       On April 21, 2017, plaintiff moved for an order to show cause as to why LeFande should\n\nnot be held in contempt, and it renewed its request for leave to issue a subpoena to LeFande.

In support of\n\nits motion, plaintiff pointed to testimony in a related proceeding in a Maryland state court that\n\nLeFande was complicit in the concealment of defendant Day\u2019s assets. Pl.\u2019s Mem. of P. & A. in\n\nSupp. of Pl.\u2019s Mot. [Dkt. # 107-1] (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mem.\u201d) at 3. Plaintiff proffers that Day transferred over\n\n$80,000 in profits received from a November 2014 sale of property in St. Mary\u2019s County,\n\nMaryland to an account in New Zealand. Id. At a trial related to the St. Mary\u2019s County transaction,\n\n\n1      Day has since passed away. See Suggestion of Death [Dkt. # 106].\n\n                                                 2\n\fa witness testified that it was Day\u2019s attorney, Matthew LeFande, who instructed the settlement\n\ncompany to transfer the funds to the New Zealand account. Id.\n\n       LeFande opposed the motion and sought a protective order. Opp. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. & Request\n\nfor Protective Order [Dkt. # 108] (\u201cLeFande\u2019s Opp.\u201d). In his opposition, LeFande asserted his\n\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and he also asserted that any testimony would\n\nbe covered by the attorney-client privilege. Id.\n\n       In an opinion dated June 2, 2017, the Magistrate Judge granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for the\n\nissuance of a subpoena, denied LeFande\u2019s motion for a protective order, and stayed the request for\n\na show cause order. Mem. Op. & Order [Dkt. # 110] (\u201cMagistrate Judge\u2019s Opinion\u201d). The\n\nMagistrate Judge concluded that LeFande\u2019s assertions of privilege were premature because\n\nLeFande would be required to assert the attorney-client and fifth-amendment privileges on a\n\nquestion-by-question basis. Id. at 8\u20139. On June 16, 2017, LeFande filed objections to the\n\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s order, and he renewed his request for a protective order. Obj. to Magistrate\n\nJudge\u2019s Op. & Request for Protective Order [Dkt. # 111] (\u201cLeFande\u2019s Obj.\u201d). In that opposition,\n\nLeFande also contends that plaintiff violated D.C. Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4 by \u201cseek[ing]\n\nor threaten[ing] to seek criminal charges or disciplinary charges solely to obtain an advantage in a\n\ncivil matter.\u201d Id. at 11\u201312. 2 Plaintiff responded to the objections, Reply in Obj. to LeFande\u2019s Obj.\n\n[Dkt. # 112] (\u201cPl.\u2019s Resp.\u201d), and LeFande did not file a reply. Because LeFande has not pointed\n\n\n\n\n2       This argument is frivolous. Plaintiff has not sought criminal or disciplinary charges; it\nseeks contempt for counsel\u2019s alleged violations of the Court\u2019s orders. See Pl.\u2019s Mot. As the D.C.\nBar put it, in the context of a criminal contempt proceeding, \u201c[t]o interpret Rule 8.4(g) to apply to\nsuch a proceeding would, effectively, make it a disciplinary violation for a lawyer to seek this\nparticular remedy, a clearly illogical and anomalous result.\u201d D.C.

Baylor v. Mitchell Rubenstein & Assocs., P.C., 857 F.3d 939, 945 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2017), quoting LCvR 72.2(a). 3 If any party files written objections to a Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling\n\non such a matter, the District Court \u201cmay modify or set aside any portion of [the] order . . . found\n\nto be clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\u201d LCvR 72.2(c). \u201cA court should make such a finding\n\nwhen the court \u2018is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019\u201d\n\nNew Life Evangelistic Ctr., Inc. v. Sebelius, 847 F. Supp. 2d 50, 53 (D.D.C. 2012), quoting Am.\n\nSoc\u2019y for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals v. Feld Entm\u2019t, Inc., 659 F.3d 13, 21 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n3        The Court referred this matter to the Magistrate Judge under Local Civil Rule 72.2(a), and\nneither party has objected to that referral. But it appears to be a matter of first impression in this\njurisdiction whether a Magistrate Judge has the power to resolve post-judgment discovery issues.\nIn the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636, Congress gave magistrate judges the authority\n\u201cto hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), and\nit also empowered district judges to assign to magistrate judges any \u201csuch additional duties as are\nnot inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.\u201d Id. \u00a7 636(b)(3). Leading\ncommenters have concluded that the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the power of Magistrate\nJudges \u201c[c]ertainly . . . can reach the assignment under section 636(b)(3) of posttrial matters\ncomparable in importance to those section 636(b)(1) authorizes a magistrate judge to address\nbefore trial.\u201d 12 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 3068.1 (2d ed. 1995);\n14 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 72.02 (Matthew Bender 3d ed.) (\u201cDiscovery is a nondispositive\npretrial matter that may be referred for disposition to a magistrate judge. Postjudgment discovery\nin collection proceedings may also be referred to a magistrate judge.\u201d). Because the management\nof post-judgment discovery is comparable in importance to the management of pretrial discovery,\nthe Court will review the Magistrate Judge\u2019s opinion under the \u201cclear error\u201d standard. The Court\nnotes, however, that its decision would be the same whether it used the \u201cclear error\u201d standard, or\nwhether it reviewed the Magistrate Judge\u2019s opinion de novo \u2013 there is ample support in the record,\nwhich the Court has reviewed in its entirety, for the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusions.\n                                                  4\n\f                                           ANALYSIS\n\n       LeFande challenges the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling on two grounds: first, he argues that any\n\ntestimony that would be sought from him would be protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination, and second, he contends that any testimony would be protected by\n\nattorney-client privilege. Because LeFande cannot assert these privileges to bar all questioning,\n\nthe Court will overrule the objections.\n\nI.     LeFande must assert the self-incrimination privilege on a question-by-question basis.\n       LeFande argued before the Magistrate Judge that he would refuse to answer any questions\n\nabout the St. Mary\u2019s County transaction, and he cited his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-\n\nincrimination. LeFande\u2019s Opp. at 7. The Magistrate Judge concluded that LeFande\u2019s blanket\n\nassertion of the self-incrimination privilege was premature. The Magistrate Judge held:\n\n               [N]o authority supports the proposition that the threat by a witness to claim\n               such privileges is a basis upon which to preclude the issuance of a subpoena.\n               Rather, the applicable authorities require that claims of such privileges be\n               made in response to a specific question or questions actually posed, or\n               specific documents actually requested.\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s Opinion at 8\u20139. While LeFande asserts that \u201cthere are no questions the attorney\n\nwill answer without asserting the [Fifth Amendment] privilege,\u201d LeFande Obj. at 9, he does not\n\nargue that the Magistrate Judge erred in any way. Because the Court agrees with the Magistrate\n\nJudge\u2019s conclusion, LeFande\u2019s objection will be overruled.\n\n       The Fifth Amendment protects a person from being \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be\n\na witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V. The privilege \u201ccan be asserted in any\n\nproceeding, civil or criminal . . . and it protects any disclosures which the witness reasonably\n\nbelieves could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so\n\nused.\u201d Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 444\u201345 (1972). The privilege may be invoked\n\nwhenever a witness reasonably believes that his testimony could \u201cfurnish a link in the chain of\n\n                                                 5\n\fevidence needed to prosecute\u201d him for a crime. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486\n\n(1951). But the danger of self-incrimination must be real, not remote or speculative. Zicarelli v.\n\nN.J. State Comm\u2019n of Investigation, 406 U.S. 472, 478 (1972). So, as the Supreme Court held\n\nmore than sixty years ago, \u201c[a]s to each question to which a claim of privilege is directed, the court\n\nmust determine whether the answer to that particular question would subject the witness to a real\n\ndanger of . . . [in]crimination.\u201d Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367, 374 (1951).\n\n         Because a witness must have a reasonable belief that a disclosure could be used in a\n\nsubsequent criminal proceeding, \u201c[t]here is a presumption against blanket assertions of Fifth\n\nAmendment privilege,\u201d United States v. McAllister, 693 F.3d 572, 583 (6th Cir. 2012), and the\n\nlaw is clear that the privilege against self-incrimination must be asserted on a question-by-question\n\nbasis. See Anton v. Prospect Cafe Milano, Inc., 233 F.R.D. 216, 218 (D.D.C. 2006), citing United\n\nStates v. Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991); see also, e.g., Doe v. Glazner, 232\n\nF.3d 1258, 1263 (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cThe only way the privilege [against self-incrimination] can be\n\nasserted is on a question-by-question basis, and thus, as to each question asked, the party has to\n\ndecide whether or not to raise his Fifth Amendment right.\u201d); Vazquez-Rijos v. Anhang, 654 F.3d\n\n122, 129 (1st Cir. 2011) (rejecting a litigant\u2019s argument that the Fifth Amendment privilege\n\nexcused her from appearing at a deposition, holding that the \u201cFifth Amendment privilege \u2018cannot\n\nbe invoked on a blanket basis\u2019\u201d), quoting United States v. Castro, 129 F.3d 226, 229 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n         So LeFande must sit for the deposition, and while he may assert the Fifth Amendment\n\nprivilege in response to particular questions as appropriate, he must answer questions with the\n\nunderstanding that the danger of self-incrimination must be real, not remote or speculative.\n\nZicarelli, 406 U.S. at 478.\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fII.    LeFande must assert the attorney-client privilege on a question-by-question basis.\n       LeFande argued before the Magistrate Judge that plaintiff\u2019s allegations of wrongdoing\n\n\u201ccannot overcome any privilege in the communications between this attorney and either\n\nDefendant.\u201d LeFande\u2019s Opp. at 11. The Magistrate Judge rejected this blanket assertion of\n\nattorney-client privilege. Magistrate Judge\u2019s Opinion at 8\u20139. LeFande now argues that the\n\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s decision \u201cflies in the face\u201d of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v.\n\nZolin, 491 U.S. 554, 565 (1989). LeFande\u2019s Obj. at 12. Because the Court concludes that the\n\nMagistrate Judge did not commit clear error, LeFande\u2019s objections will be overruled.\n\n       \u201cThe attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential\n\ncommunications known to the common law.\u201d Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389\n\n(1981). Its purpose is \u201cto encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their\n\nclients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration\n\nof justice.\u201d Id. The privilege \u201capplies to a confidential communication between attorney and client\n\nif that communication was made for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice to the\n\nclient.\u201d In re Kellogg Brown & Root, Inc., 756 F.3d 754, 757 (D.C. Cir. 2014). A party asserting\n\nthe attorney-client privilege must demonstrate that:\n\n       (1)     The asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a client;\n\n       (2)     The person to whom the communication was made (a) is a member of the\n               bar of a court or her subordinate and (b) in connection with this\n               communication is acting as a lawyer;\n\n       (3)     The communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was informed (a)\n               by his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c) for the purpose of\n               securing primarily either (i) an opinion on the law; (ii) legal services; or (iii)\n               assistance in some legal proceeding, and not (d) for the purpose of\n               committing a crime or tort; and\n\n       (4)     The privilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fIn re Sealed Case, 737 F.2d 94, 98\u201399 (D.C. Cir. 1984).                In short, the privilege covers\n\ncommunications, and not all acts undertaken on behalf of a client, and it does not cover\n\ncommunications that the attorney had with third parties.\n\n        The attorney-client privilege is \u201cnarrowly construed by the D.C. Circuit because of its\n\nadverse effects on the full disclosure of truth.\u201d United States v. Philip Morris Inc., 212 F.R.D.\n\n421, 424 (D.D.C. 2002). Therefore, \u201c[a] blanket assertion of the [attorney-client] privilege will\n\nnot suffice. Rather, [t]he proponent must conclusively prove each element of the privilege.\u201d In re\n\nLindsey, 158 F.3d 1263, 1270 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n\n        To support his blanket assertion of attorney-client privilege, LeFande relies on the Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s decision in United States v. Zolin, but that case is largely irrelevant to this dispute. See\n\nLeFande Obj. at 12. In Zolin, the Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether a district\n\ncourt could review documents in camera to determine whether those documents were privileged,\n\nor whether they were subject to the crime-fraud exception. Zolin, 491 U.S. at 556\u201357. The\n\nSupreme Court looked to Federal Rules of Evidence 104(a) and 1101(c), 4 and it concluded that it\n\ncould \u201cnot interpret Rule 104(a) as categorically prohibiting the party opposing the privilege on\n\ncrime-fraud grounds from relying on the results of an in camera review of the communications.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n4        Rule 104(a) provides that \u201c[p]reliminary questions concerning . . . the existence of a\nprivilege . . . shall be determined by the court,\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 104(a), and Rule 1101(c) provides\nthat \u201c[t]he rule with respect to privileges applies at all stages of all actions, cases, and proceedings.\u201d\nFed. R. Evid. 1101(c).\n\n                                                    8\n\fId. at 568. But no party has asked the Court to review documents in camera to establish whether\n\nthe elements of the crime-fraud exception have been met, so Zolin is inapposite. 5\n\n       It would not invade the attorney client privilege to ask Mr. LeFande about his alleged role\n\nin the transfer of funds to New Zealand and any actions he took or instructions he provided to third\n\nparties to that end. Because the deposition will not necessarily inquire into privileged matters, and\n\nbecause the Court finds no clear error in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling requiring LeFande to sit for\n\na deposition and assert any applicable privileges in response to particular questions, as appropriate,\n\nLeFande\u2019s objections will be overruled. 6\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n       For those reasons, it is hereby\n\n       ORDERED that Matthew LeFande\u2019s objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Opinion are\n\nOVERRULED.\n\n       SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                                               AMY BERMAN JACKSON\n                                               United States District Judge\nDATE: July 14, 2017\n\n\n\n5        LeFande also argues that it would \u201coffend[] Rule 1\u201d of the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\nto sit for a deposition at which he will \u201crecite the same objections,\u201d and thereafter be brought \u201cback\nto the Court for consideration of the very same privileges already asserted herein.\u201d LeFande\u2019s\nObj. at 12. But the law does not permit LeFande to make a blanket assertion of privilege, and the\nCourt will be in a better position to determine whether particular questions call for privileged\nresponses when it has the precise questions before it.\n\n6      LeFande also raises equitable concerns as to whether post-judgment discovery on the St.\nMary\u2019s County matter is appropriate. LeFande\u2019s Opp. at 15\u201316. The Court referred the post-\njudgment discovery matters to the Magistrate Judge, Order [Dkt. # 90] (Apr. 5, 2016); Order [Dkt.\n# 95] (June 29, 2016), so those concerns are better directed at the Magistrate Judge in the first\ninstance.\n                                                  9\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "1f113747456731d28033b786773121275373694a", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "District Court, District of Columbia", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/104849/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/104912/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/108541/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/108542/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/110374/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112308/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/197657/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/223445/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/437451/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/555898/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/616285/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/758719/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/771190/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2017-07-14T21:01:30.747846Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 9, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/4409259/district-title-v-warren/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "4186512", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "District Title v.
