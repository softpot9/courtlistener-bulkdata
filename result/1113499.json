Evans, Atty. Gen., and Robert Ward, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., for appellee.</p>\n<p>Alabama Supreme Court 1921351.</p>\n<p>MONTIEL, Judge.</p>\n<p>Joseph Andrews, Jr., was indicted for trafficking in cocaine, in violation of \u00a7 13A-12-231, Code of Alabama 1975. He was found guilty and was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment. The appellant raises three issues on appeal.</p>\n<p>The evidence elicited at trial tended to show the following:</p>\n<p>Gary Jenkins, an employee with the Houston County Sheriff's Department, testified that he received information from a confidential informant with regard to cocaine being brought into Houston County. He stated that the informant had said that a black male by the name of Joseph Holloway would be driving a yellow and black Buick Electra automobile with primer spots and bearing a Florida tag and that he would be transporting cocaine. The informant, he said, identified the direction in which the car would be travelling.</p>\n<p>Jenkins further testified that after receiving the information, he notified Sheriff Hadden and Investigators Greene, Ketchens, Hughs and Baker. They then proceeded to set up surveillance on Highway 84. Jenkins and Hadden arrived at the surveillance area at 12:30 or 1:00 a.m. It was raining and foggy.</p>\n<p>According to Jenkins, at around 1:45 a.m., a car matching the description furnished by the informant was stopped by the officers. The appellant was driving and there were three passengers in the car: a black male, who was in the front passenger seat, and two black females, who were in the back seat. Jenkins testified that he and Hadden removed the occupants from the car and began to search the car. Because of the inclement weather and the lack of adequate lighting, a decision was made to continue the search at the county jail. Jenkins testified that no contraband was found during the roadside search.</p>\n<p>The females rode with Jenkins and Hadden to the county jail. The appellant and the other male rode with Investigators Greene and Ketchens. En route to the jail, one of the females kept her hand under her shirt and was \"fidgety\". Sheriff Hadden noticed her put something behind the seat. When they arrived at the jail, Jenkins found a brown paper sack in the back of the car. It contained 10 bags of marijuana and 7 pieces of crack cocaine. The females were then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p>According to Jenkins, the search of the appellant's car continued at the jail. A can of WD-40 lubricant was found in the trunk, sitting on top of a gasoline can. The gasoline can was in turn sitting on a plastic raincoat, which was on top of a tool box. Officer Jenkins said that he picked up the can of WD-40 and shook it and that he took the top off and sprayed it. He stated that the weight of the can aroused his suspicions and that when he twisted the ends of the can the bottom twisted off. Inside the WD-40 can he found a brown paper bag, which contained pieces of what was later determined to be crack cocaine. There were coffee grounds located on the outside of the bag. Jenkins testified that he had the opportunity to ask the appellant what his name was. He told Jenkins that his name was Joseph Holloway. Jenkins said that he subsequently learned that the appellant's name was Joseph Andrews. Jenkins identified State's exhibit 4 as an identification card that had been taken <span class=\"star-pagination\">*1097</span> from the appellant. This card was issued in the name of Joseph Andrews and showed a Florida address. Jenkins testified that the appellant had indicated that the vehicle he had been driving belonged to him. Receipts were found in the car. Some of these receipts were in the name of Joseph Andrews and some were in the name of Joseph Holloway. A map of Florida and the adjoining states with a line drawn from Florida to Dothan was also located in the car.</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, Jenkins indicated that when Sheriff Hadden made the stop of the appellant's vehicle, he activated the blue lights and the \"wig-wags\" on his patrol car. The appellant traveled approximately 50 yards before stopping. Sheriff Hadden approached the driver's side of the car and Jenkins approached the passenger's side. Jenkins testified that he did not question the appellant at the scene but that he questioned him at the county jail after the search of the appellant's car had been completed. Jenkins indicated that Sheriff Hadden asked the appellant his name at the scene. Jenkins overheard the appellant say that his name was Joseph Holloway.</p>\n<p>In addition to the WD-40 can, other items such as fishing rods, tools, an amplifier, and suitcases containing clothes, were also located in the trunk of the car. Jenkins admitted that other people could have had access to the trunk and that the appellant's fingerprints were not found on the WD-40 can. On redirect examination, Jenkins testified that all of the occupants of the car denied ownership of the suitcases.</p>\n<p>David Thorne, an employee of the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, testified that he received an evidence envelope from the Houston County Sheriff's Department. He said that he examined the contents of the envelope and that it contained 10 small \"zip lock\" plastic bags. Within each of these bags was off-white compressed material. Thorne testified that he examined the material and that he identified it to be cocaine. Thorne testified that it weighed 29.750 grams.</p>\n<p>Sheriff Hadden testified that on the night in question he stopped a vehicle driven by the appellant. It was raining and foggy. Hadden asked the appellant his name and he said that his name was Joseph Holloway. Hadden identified State's exhibit 4 as the identification given to him by the appellant (which was issued in the name Joseph Andrews).</p>\n<p>On cross-examination, Hadden testified that the appellant did not pull over immediately when Hadden activated the blue lights on his patrol car and that he continued for what \"seemed like a long ways\" before he pulled over. Hadden testified that after the search of the car it began to rain harder so he and Jenkins decided to continue the search at the jail.</p>\n<p>The appellant testified that on the morning he was stopped, he was traveling to Demopolis, Alabama, where he had family. He testified that the other male and one of the females had suitcases in the car. He stated that he and the other female were sharing a suitcase. The appellant denied having any knowledge of the cocaine and in fact requested the officers to fingerprint the WD-40 can. They declined. He denied telling the sheriff that his name was Joseph Holloway or ever using the name Joseph Holloway.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The appellant contends that the prosecution used its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner, violating <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span> (1986).</p>\n<p>The record reflects that the appellant entered a timely <i>Batson</i> motion challenging the State's use of its peremptory strikes to remove all 3 black veniremembers from the venire. The trial court took judicial notice that the appellant was a black and conducted a hearing on the <i>Batson</i> motion. The prosecution did not request the trial court to determine whether a prima facie case of racial discrimination had been established but instead proceeded to state its reasons for striking the 3 black jurors. Accordingly, we will review the reasons asserted by the prosecution without addressing whether the prosecution had established a prima facie case. See <i>Jackson v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1872208\"><a href=\"/opinion/1872208/jackson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span> (Ala.Crim. App.1991).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*1098</span> The defendant challenged the State's use of its peremptory strikes to strike prospective jurors nos. 28, 75, and 98. The State's reason offered for striking prospective juror no. 28 was that earlier in the week he had served on a jury that had acquitted the defendant. The trial court found this to be a sufficiently race-neutral reason. We agree. See <i>Childers v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1142702\"><a href=\"/opinion/1142702/childers-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span> (Ala.Crim.App.1992).</p>\n<p>The rationale offered for striking prospective juror no. 98 was that she had been charged with the offense of issuing bad checks. The trial court found this to be a sufficiently race-neutral reason. Again, we agree. \"We have repeatedly held that a veniremember's connection with or involvement in criminal activity may serve as a race-neutral reason for striking that veniremember.\" <i>Wilsher v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1924774\"><a href=\"/opinion/1924774/wilsher-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span> (Ala.Crim.App.1992), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p>The trial court found that the State's rationale for striking prospective juror no. 75, L.P.R., was sufficiently race-neutral. After a careful review of the record, we disagree. The pertinent portion of the record from the hearing is set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote>\"MR. MAXWELL [prosecutor]: Judge, on R., the Clerk's list, and I'll show it to the Court, under L.P.R lists a husband as being E.R., retired. Before I went to work with the district attorney's office, I represented a J.L.R. and in the course of representing a [him] I came to learn that his father is E.R. <i>I don't know whether or not this E.R. is the same E.R. that is the father of J.L.R., but due to the fact that J.L.R has been convicted in this circuit four or five times I couldn't take the chance of it being the same E.R. or a relative of Mr. J.L.R.</i> ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"MR. YOUNG: [defense counsel] May I respond to that, Judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: You may respond at the end of Mr. Maxwell's explanations. Continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\". . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"MR. YOUNG: [defense counsel] Judge, on the rational that Mr. Maxwell gave for Ms. R., we except and object to that because we feel <i>that that could have been covered on voir dire, any questions to eliminate.</i> As it stands now, Your Honor, my client has no members of his race on the jury. And for the Record, Judge, we feel that the excuse on Ms. R. is shallow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"THE COURT: Okay. Of course, neither <i>Batson</i> nor <i>[Ex parte Branch]</i> hold that any Defendant is entitled to any particular number of members of his group, his or her group, on the panel. Rather both decisions require the prosecution, in exercising its right to peremptory challenge, to do so in a way that is not based on racial factors. I am acquainted with J.L.R. myself. I presided over a trial in which he was convicted for burglary and I have heard a series of Rule 20 motions concerning convictions before I became a circuit judge and those convictions were held in Judge White's courtroom. I find that the district attorney's explanation of that strike is satisfactory.\"</blockquote>\n<p>(S.R. 15-18.)

As defense counsel astutely points out, this could have been ascertained on voir dire.</p>\n<p>Thus, in accordance with the principles set forth in <i>Bird,</i> supra, we conclude that the trial court erroneously denied the appellant's <i>Batson</i> motion. Accordingly, we must reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand the cause to the circuit court for a new trial.</p>\n<p>In the interest of judicial economy, we will address other issues that may arise in subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Prior to trial, the appellant moved to suppress the admission into evidence of the crack cocaine found in his car. This motion was denied. The appellant asserts that his motion to suppress should have been granted because, he argues, the crack cocaine found in the WD-40 can was discovered as a result of an illegal search. Specifically, the appellant argues that the officers had no probable cause to search his car.</p>\n<p>If we examine only the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we would be inclined to conclude that the State had failed to prove probable cause. There is no indication from Jenkins's testimony as to when he learned that the appellant had given the officers a false name. There was also no testimony regarding what steps were taken when the vehicle was stopped, e.g. whether identification was requested, whether a \"pat down\" was performed, etc. Additionally, there was no testimony from Sheriff Hadden regarding the questioning of the appellant. However, \"we are not limited merely to the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, but may also consider the testimony given to the jury.\" <i>Henry v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1820672\"><a href=\"/opinion/1820672/henry-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">896</span></a></span>, 899 (Ala.Crim.App.1984). Accordingly, we will examine both the evidence elicited at the suppression hearing <i>and</i> the evidence presented at trial to determine whether probable cause to search the car was established.</p>\n<p>We start our analysis with the premise that the officers were authorized to stop the appellant's car. The information provided by the informant, coupled with corroborating the details \"exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the investigatory stop.\" <i>Alabama v.

Although we find that the officers were authorized to stop the vehicle based on reasonable suspicion, the subsequent search of the vehicle cannot be justified unless it falls within an exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p>\"It is well established that, although the Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches, all searches without a warrant are deemed <i>per se</i> unreasonable unless they fall within certain recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.\" <i>Mewbourn v.

One such recognized exception is the \"automobile exception\" (see <i>Carroll v.

The automobile was clearly capable of mobility as evidenced by the fact that it was driven to the jail. The only issue to be determined to justify a warrantless search of the automobile pursuant to the automobile exception is whether probable cause existed.</p>\n<blockquote>\"It has been stated many times that `[p]robable cause deals with probabilities, not legal technicalities.

He contends that this arrest was made without probable cause and, thus, that any subsequent inventory search of the automobile was not pursuant to a lawful arrest. Accordingly, he argues, the motion to suppress should be granted. He then argues, alternatively, that even assuming he were lawfully arrested, because, he says, the sheriff's department had no established procedures concerning inventory searches the inventory search is invalid and the evidence seized as a result inadmissible.</p>\n<p>We see no reason to address these contentions because we find that there was authorization to conduct a warrantless search of the car pursuant to the automobile exception and the evidence was found a result of this legal search.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The appellant contends that the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction because, he argues, the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had constructive possession of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p>Section: 13A-12-231, Ala.Code 1975, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote>\"(2) Any person who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, or brings into this state, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive possession of, 28 grams or more of cocaine or of any mixture containing cocaine, described in section 20-2-25(1), is guilty of a felony, which felony shall be known as `trafficking in cocaine.' If the quantity involved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"a.
