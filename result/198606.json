Fernando Vazquez-Ortiz challenges the 97-month\n\nsentence imposed upon him for conspiring to launder monetary\n\ninstruments.   We affirm the district court judgment.\n\n          First, Vazquez claims, the district court erred by placing\n\nhim in criminal history category III, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, given that\n\nthe Arecibo Superior Court subsequently vacated an earlier conviction\n\nfor aggravated larceny. On the other hand, the government counters\n\nwith a more recent document from the same superior court which\n\nconclusively refutes any such vacatur.\n\n          Second, Vazquez contends that the government breached a\n\nprovision in the plea agreement \u2014 that the base offense level was to be\n\n23 and that \"there would not be any further adjustment\" \u2014 by remaining\n\nsilent as the district court imposed a three-level enhancement, on its\n\nown motion, based on the supervisory role Vazquez played in the offense\n\nof conviction. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. Once again we disagree, since\n\nthe district court carefully explained to Vazquez, during the plea\n\ncolloquy, that it was not bound by the sentencing recommendation made\n\nby the government. See United States v. Grimm, 170 F.3d 760, 768 (1st\n\nCir. 1999). Moreover, the government neither agreed to recommend that\n\nthe court impose no upward adjustments, cf. United States v. Velez-\n\nCarrero, 77 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 1996), nor to oppose whatever upward\n\nadjustments the probation office might recommend or the district court\n\nmight opt to impose, cf. United States v. Clark, 55 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                  3\n\f1995).\n\n          Finally, Vazquez argues that the district court erred in\n\nbasing its \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement exclusively on the conclusory\n\ndescription of his involvement in the charged offense set forth in the\n\npresentence report, and by refusing to conduct an evidentiary hearing.\n\nFirst, the presentence report contained reliable evidence of the\n\nsupervisory role played by Vazquez. See United States v. Gonzalez-\n\nVazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"Facts contained in a\n\npresentence report ordinarily are considered reliable evidence for\n\nsentencing purposes.\").     It indicated that Vazquez produced and\n\ndistributed flyers which he and his codefendants utilized to gain\n\naccess to mailboxes for the purpose of stealing U.S. Treasury checks.\n\nVazquez used his own vehicle to transport codefendants to these sites,\n\nto obtain false identification cards, and to cash the stolen checks.\n\nSee United States v. Joyce, 70 F.3d 679, 683 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting\n\nthat \u00a7 3B1.1 enhancement may apply where defendant was \"responsible for\n\norganizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime\"). At the\n\nRule 11 hearing, Vazquez, through counsel, not only accepted the\n\ngovernment\u2019s description of the evidence, but \"made no proffer\n\nregarding any [other] possible, let alone relevant or material,\n\nevidence that would be brought forward at an evidentiary hearing.\"\n\nUnited States v. Grant, 114 F.3d 323, 327 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          Accordingly, the factual determinations made by the district\n\n\n                                  4\n\fcourt were not clearly erroneous.
