Fernando Vazquez-Ortiz challenges the 97-month\n\nsentence imposed upon him for conspiring to launder monetary\n\ninstruments.   We affirm the district court judgment.\n\n          First, Vazquez claims, the district court erred by placing\n\nhim in criminal history category III, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1, given that\n\nthe Arecibo Superior Court subsequently vacated an earlier conviction\n\nfor aggravated larceny. On the other hand, the government counters\n\nwith a more recent document from the same superior court which\n\nconclusively refutes any such vacatur.\n\n          Second, Vazquez contends that the government breached a\n\nprovision in the plea agreement \u2014 that the base offense level was to be\n\n23 and that \"there would not be any further adjustment\" \u2014 by remaining\n\nsilent as the district court imposed a three-level enhancement, on its\n\nown motion, based on the supervisory role Vazquez played in the offense\n\nof conviction. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1. Once again we disagree, since\n\nthe district court carefully explained to Vazquez, during the plea\n\ncolloquy, that it was not bound by the sentencing recommendation made\n\nby the government.
