The court designated her former husband, Chad\n\nCurtis, appellee, the children\u2019s residential parent and legal custodian. Jamaica challenges this decision.\n\nFinding no error, we affirm.\n\f                                                                                                       \uf02d2\uf02d\n\n\n                                                Background\n\n        {\u00b6 2}     Jamaica (Mother) and Chad (Father) have two children together\u2013L.C., born in 2002,\n\nand his sister, H.C., born in 2003. In August 2010, Mother and Father were divorced, and a\n\nshared-parenting decree was entered. Later that same year, both parties asked the domestic relations\n\ncourt to terminate shared parenting. The court referred the matter to a magistrate.\n\n        {\u00b6 3}     On the magistrate\u2019s order, the court\u2019s Family Relations Department completed a\n\nfamily investigation and filed a report. The magistrate held a hearing at which Mother and Father\n\ntestified as well as the maternal grandmother and paternal grandfather. In October 2011, the magistrate\n\nissued a decision recommending that shared parenting continue but with modifications. Both parties\n\nfiled objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision with the trial court.\n\n        {\u00b6 4}     In May 2012, the trial court largely rejected the magistrate\u2019s decision. After\n\ndetermining that it was in the children\u2019s best interest to terminate shared parenting, the court concluded\n\nthat it was in the children\u2019s best interest to designate Father as their residential parent and legal\n\ncustodian.\n\n        {\u00b6 5}     Mother appealed.\n\n                          The Designation of Father as the Custodian Parent\n\n        {\u00b6 6}     Mother\u2019s sole assignment of error challenges the trial court\u2019s designation of Father as\n\nthe custodial parent. Mother contends that this decision is an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion and that the\n\ndesignation of Father is contrary to the weight of the evidence. We disagree with both contentions.\n\n        {\u00b6 7}     Before explaining our disagreement, we briefly address the statutory requirements for\n\nterminating shared parenting and issuing a modified decree allocating parental rights. The governing\n\nstatute, R.C. 3109.04, permits a court to modify a parental-rights decree. R.C. 3109.04(E)(1). And the\n\nstatue permits a court to terminate shared parenting. R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(c). Generally, to modify a\n\nparental rights decree the court must first find that there has been a change in circumstances. R.C.\n\f                                                                                                       \uf02d3\uf02d\n\n\n3109.04(E)(1)(a). But a change in circumstances is not required before terminating shared parenting.\n\nBrennaman v. Huber, 2d Dist. Greene Nos. 97 CA 53 and 94 DR 0058, 1998 WL 127081, *2 (Mar. 20,\n\n1998) (saying that \u201cnothing in R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(c) requires the trial court to find a change of\n\ncircumstances in order to terminate a shared parenting agreement\u201d). To terminate shared parenting, the\n\nstatue requires only \u201c\u2018that the court find that it is in the best interests of the minor child.\u2019\u201d Toler v.\n\nToler, 2d Dist. Clark No. 10-CA-69, 2011-Ohio-3510, \u00b6 11, quoting Beismann v. Beismann, 2d Dist.\n\nMontgomery No. 22323, 2008-Ohio-984, \u00b6 8; see Goetze v. Goetze, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16491,\n\n1998 WL 136164, *2 (Mar. 27, 1998) (observing that \u201c[s]everal appellate districts, including this one,\n\nhave held that a trial court need not find a change of circumstances before terminating a shared\n\nparenting decree\u201d). After termination, the court issues a modified decree allocating parental rights \u201cas if\n\nno decree for shared parenting had been granted and as if no request for shared parenting ever had been\n\nmade.\u201d R.C. 3109.04(E)(2)(d).\n\n        {\u00b6 8}     Here the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate the shared-parenting decree is not\n\nchallenged\u2013both parties asked the court to terminate it. The parties appear to be under the mistaken\n\nimpression that a change in circumstances was needed for the court to do this. Both parties briefed the\n\nchange-in-circumstances issue, despite agreeing that there has been a change. Because the issue is not\n\ncontested, we will not consider it further.\n\n        {\u00b6 9}     The contested issues raised are abuse of discretion and the weight of the evidence.\n\n\u201cThe discretion which a trial court enjoys in custody matters should be accorded the utmost respect.\u201d\n\nMiller v. Miller, 37 Ohio St.3d 71, 74, 523 N.E.2d 846 (1988). \u201cThe knowledge a trial court gains\n\nthrough observing the witnesses and the parties in a custody proceeding cannot be conveyed to a\n\nreviewing court by a printed record. Thus, a reviewing court may not reverse a custody determination\n\nunless the trial court has abused its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Beismann at \u00b6 20. An abuse of\n\ndiscretion \u201cimplies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d Blakemore v.\n\nBlakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \u201c\u2018A decision is unreasonable if there is no\n\f                                                                                                       \uf02d4\uf02d\n\n\nsound reasoning process that would support that decision.\u2019\u201d Beismann at \u00b6 20, quoting AAAA\n\nEnterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553\n\nN.E.2d 597 (1990).\n\n        {\u00b6 10} The trial court concluded that Father is more reliable and better suited to be the\n\nchildren\u2019s custodial parent. The court reached this decision from the following findings of fact. Before\n\nthe divorce, the family lived in Miamisburg, Ohio. Mother continues to live in Miamisburg with her\n\nparents, and Father has moved to Xenia, Ohio, and lives with his parents. Father currently has the\n\nchildren most of the time. The children now attend school in Xenia. The children participate in various\n\nactivities in both locations, for example, soccer in Xenia and scouts in Miamisburg.\n\n        {\u00b6 11} The court found that the children enjoy spending time with both of their parents and\n\nwant to spend time with them both. The magistrate interviewed both children in chambers, and a\n\ntranscript of each interview is in the record. The transcripts show that the children enjoy their time with\n\nboth parents. Neither child voiced any concern with life at either grandparents\u2019 house. The only\n\ncomplaint came from L.C. who said that he would like more time with Mother.\n\n        {\u00b6 12} Aside from their inability to work together for their children\u2019s sake, the court\u2019s only\n\nreal criticism was directed at Mother. The court noted that she had had difficulty getting the children to\n\nschool on the days they were with her. The children were often with her on Fridays, and they were\n\nconsistently absent or late on those Fridays. While Mother blamed illness for the absences, the court\n\npointed out that no doctor\u2019s note was provided, that both children would miss school on those days, and\n\nthat the children would sometimes participate in other activities on those days.\n\n        {\u00b6 13} Finally, the court noted that the Family Investigation Report recommends that Father\n\nbe designated the custodial parent. It also noted that the report recommends that Mother submit to a\n\nmental health assessment, but the court did not follow this recommendation.\n\n        {\u00b6 14} We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by designating Father the\n\ncustodial parent. Mother does not really dispute any of the trial court\u2019s factual findings. And based on\n\f                                                                                                      \uf02d5\uf02d\n\n\nthese facts, the court\u2019s decision is reasonable.\n\n        {\u00b6 15} The weight of the evidence concerns \u201c\u2018the inclination of the greater amount of\n\ncredible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis\n\nsic.) Eastley v. Volkman, ___ Ohio St.3d ___, 2012-Ohio-2179, \u00b6 12, quoting State v. Thompkins, 78\n\nOhio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997); see Forney v. Forney, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA\n\n2011-08-057, 2012-Ohio-3427, \u00b6 34 (quoting the same in its review of a trial court\u2019s best-interest\n\ndecision). In a review of the manifest weight of the evidence, \u201cevery reasonable presumption must be\n\nmade in favor of the judgment and the finding of facts.\u201d Volkman, supra at \u00b6 21. \u201cIf the evidence is\n\nsusceptible of more than one construction, the reviewing court is bound to give it that interpretation\n\nwhich is consistent with the verdict and judgment * * *.\u201d Id. [citations omitted]\n\n        {\u00b6 16} Mother does not say exactly why the designation of Father as the custodial parent goes\n\nagainst the evidence\u2019s weight. She does not challenge the credibility of any of the evidence presented.\n\nBased on our review of the record evidence, we do not think that it establishes clearly that either parent\n\nshould be favored over the other. Because the evidence is susceptible to more than one interpretation,\n\nand we must construe the evidence consistent with the trial court\u2019s judgment, we cannot find the\n\ndesignation of Father as custodian to be contrary to the weight of the evidence.\n\n        {\u00b6 17} The sole assignment of error is overruled.\n\n        {\u00b6 18} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n                                              .............\n\n\nDONOVAN and VUKOVICH, JJ., concur.\n\n(Hon.

Because the issue is not\n\ncontested, we will not consider it further.\n\n        {\u00b6 9}     The contested issues raised are abuse of discretion and the weight of the evidence.\n\n\u201cThe discretion which a trial court enjoys in custody matters should be accorded the utmost respect.\u201d\n\nMiller v.

The court reached this decision from the following findings of fact. Before\n\nthe divorce, the family lived in Miamisburg, Ohio. Mother continues to live in Miamisburg with her\n\nparents, and Father has moved to Xenia, Ohio, and lives with his parents. Father currently has the\n\nchildren most of the time. The children now attend school in Xenia. The children participate in various\n\nactivities in both locations, for example, soccer in Xenia and scouts in Miamisburg.\n\n        {\u00b6 11} The court found that the children enjoy spending time with both of their parents and\n\nwant to spend time with them both. The magistrate interviewed both children in chambers, and a\n\ntranscript of each interview is in the record. The transcripts show that the children enjoy their time with\n\nboth parents. Neither child voiced any concern with life at either grandparents\u2019 house. The only\n\ncomplaint came from L.C. who said that he would like more time with Mother.\n\n        {\u00b6 12} Aside from their inability to work together for their children\u2019s sake, the court\u2019s only\n\nreal criticism was directed at Mother. The court noted that she had had difficulty getting the children to\n\nschool on the days they were with her. The children were often with her on Fridays, and they were\n\nconsistently absent or late on those Fridays. While Mother blamed illness for the absences, the court\n\npointed out that no doctor\u2019s note was provided, that both children would miss school on those days, and\n\nthat the children would sometimes participate in other activities on those days.\n\n        {\u00b6 13} Finally, the court noted that the Family Investigation Report recommends that Father\n\nbe designated the custodial parent. It also noted that the report recommends that Mother submit to a\n\nmental health assessment, but the court did not follow this recommendation.\n\n        {\u00b6 14} We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by designating Father the\n\ncustodial parent. Mother does not really dispute any of the trial court\u2019s factual findings. And based on\n\f                                                                                                      \uf02d5\uf02d\n\n\nthese facts, the court\u2019s decision is reasonable.\n\n        {\u00b6 15} The weight of the evidence concerns \u201c\u2018the inclination of the greater amount of\n\ncredible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis\n\nsic.)
