The\ndistrict court dismissed her case as barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion, and\n\n\n\n      *\n      After an examination of the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral\nargument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record.\nSee FED. R. APP. P. 34(a)(2).\n\fNo. 06-3567                                                                       Page 2\n\nPullen-Walker filed several motions for postjudgment relief, which the district court\ndenied. We affirm.\n       This is the second appeal arising out of the fourth of at least five civil actions\nPullen-Walker has brought against the university. The first of these, No. 04 C 3728,\nwas filed in the federal district court in Chicago in May 2005. Judge Coar dismissed\nthe complaint because the court lacked jurisdiction over all but one of the many\nclaims, but gave Pullen-Walker leave to file an amended complaint within a specified\ntime. She failed to do so, and so Judge Coar dismissed the case. Pullen-Walker\nappealed, and in an unpublished order we summarily affirmed. See Pullen-Walker v.\nRoosevelt Univ., No. 04-3456 (7th Cir. Nov. 4, 2004). She then petitioned this court\nfor a writ of mandamus, which we denied. See In re Pullen-Walker, No. 05-1113 (7th\nCir. Jan. 26, 2005).\n\n       In October 2005 Pullen-Walker filed her fourth lawsuit against the university\n(by then her second and third lawsuits, Nos. 04 C 3733 and 05 C 3600, already had\nbeen dismissed) and requested that counsel be recruited to assist her. Judge Darrah\nagreed and enlisted a lawyer who filed an amended complaint claiming\ndiscrimination on the basis of Pullen-Walker\u2019s age, sex, race, and disability. In July\n2006, however, the district court allowed counsel to withdraw and, having been\napprised of the previous suits before other judges, dismissed the entire action on\ngrounds of claim preclusion. Judge Darrah added that, with respect to the claim of\ndisability discrimination, Pullen-Walker had failed to exhaust her administrative\nremedies under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213.\n\n       The same day that judgment was docketed, Pullen-Walker moved for\nreconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). Judge Darrah declined.\nPullen-Walker then filed an untimely notice of appeal, which we dismissed for lack of\njurisdiction. See Pullen-Walker v. Roosevelt Univ., No. 07-2076 (7th Cir. June 22,\n2005). Between August 14 and 22, 2006, Pullen-Walker filed four additional motions\nfor postjudgment relief; each was filed outside the 10-day limit for motions under\nRule 59(e), so all of them are properly construed as motions under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 60(b).
