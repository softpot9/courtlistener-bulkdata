The district court found that Means' first amended complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted because, inter alia, the Commissioner was protected by the doctrine of judicial immunity.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Means' complaint against Commissioner Brandenburg arises out of a hearing the Commissioner conducted in a small claims case.  Appellant argues that \"California Commissioners are not judges\" and thus are not entitled to judicial immunity.  We reject this claim.  This circuit's law makes clear that judicial immunity extends to municipal court commissioners.  O'Neil v.

Commissioner Brandenberg neither acted in \"clear absence of jurisdiction\" nor engaged in \"non-judicial acts\" when, in disposing of Means' claims, he 1) advised the defendants to file a malicious prosecution claim against Means and 2) ruled against Means on res judicata grounds.  Certainly a judge is free to comment on the record that the case before him or her appears frivolous or without basis.  By \"advising\" the Schoenbergs to file a malicious prosecution suit against Means, Commissioner Brandenburg did just that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Means' claim that the Commissioner's bias against Means infused the entire proceeding as intent plays no role in the immunity analysis.  Ashelman, 973 F.2d at 1078;  Sparkman, 435 U.S. at 356 (\"A judge will not be deprived of immunity because the action he took ... was done maliciously....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly dismissed with prejudice any potential state law claims that may have been raised by Means' complaint.  California courts have held that judicial immunity extends to court commissioners in the exercise of judicial functions, even if their acts are in excess of jurisdiction or are alleged to have been malicious or corrupt.
