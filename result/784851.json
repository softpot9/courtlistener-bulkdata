Consistent with the terms of his plea agreement with the government, the district court sentenced Pedroza to a term of 92 months followed by a mandatory consecutive sentence of 60 months for possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. In response to the government's Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 35(b) motion, the court later reduced Pedroza's total sentence to 130 months.

Pedroza does not claim that his sentence was (1) imposed in violation of law, (2) imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, (3) greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range, or (4) imposed for an offense that has no guideline or is plainly unreasonable. <i>See id.</i> Rather, Pedroza contends only that the district court abused its discretion by failing to reduce his offense level, and consequently his sentence, to a degree that he believes properly reflects the assistance he provided to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Accordingly, Pedroza has failed to satisfy the requirements set forth in &#167; 3742(a) and, under <i>Arishi,</i> 54 F.3d at 599, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review his appeal.
