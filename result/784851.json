Consistent with the terms of his plea agreement with the government, the district court sentenced Pedroza to a term of 92 months followed by a mandatory consecutive sentence of 60 months for possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. In response to the government's Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 35(b) motion, the court later reduced Pedroza's total sentence to 130 months. Pedroza challenges the extent of the reduction, arguing that it did not adequately reflect the breadth of his cooperation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right to appeal is statutory, not constitutional, so a party's claim \"must come within the terms of[an] applicable statute\" to establish appellate jurisdiction. <i>United States v.

Appeals of a sentence reduction pursuant to Rule 35(b) are controlled exclusively by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742. <i>Id.</i> at 599(holding that \"the exclusive avenue of appeal of rulings on Rule 35(b) motions is 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 3742, a prospective appellant must establish that the sentence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) was imposed in violation of law;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; or,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) is greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range to the extent that the sentence includes a greater fine or term of imprisonment, probation, or supervised release than the maximum established in the guideline range, or includes a more limiting condition of probation or supervised release under section 3563(b)(6) or (b)(11) than the maximum established in the guideline range; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 3742(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Pedroza is appealing the district court's ruling on a Rule 35 motion, this Court may assert jurisdiction only if his appeal satisfies one of &#167; 3742's four criteria. Pedroza does not claim that his sentence was (1) imposed in violation of law, (2) imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, (3) greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range, or (4) imposed for an offense that has no guideline or is plainly unreasonable. <i>See id.</i> Rather, Pedroza contends only that the district court abused its discretion by failing to reduce his offense level, and consequently his sentence, to a degree that he believes properly reflects the assistance he provided to the government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Accordingly, Pedroza has failed to satisfy the requirements set forth in &#167; 3742(a) and, under <i>Arishi,</i> 54 F.3d at 599, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review his appeal.
