The basic process for making Portland\ncement is much the same today as it was when the material\nwas first developed nearly 200 years ago.              Cement\nmanufacturers pulverize limestone and minerals, and then\nheat those raw materials to several thousand degrees. The\nresulting substance, called clinker, is then cooled and ground\ninto a fine gray powder. This powder \u2013 called Portland\ncement \u2013 is later combined with sand, rocks, and water to\nmake concrete.\n\n    The grinding and heating involved in cement\nmanufacturing has an unfortunate side effect: It releases into\nthe air a number of hazardous air pollutants, most notably\n\f                              3\nmercury, hydrochloric acid, hydrocarbons, and particulate\nmatter. This case concerns EPA\u2019s efforts to develop rules\nunder the Clean Air Act to limit emissions of those pollutants\nfrom cement plants.\n\n     In a previous decision, we considered EPA\u2019s first attempt\nto create emission standards for the cement industry, and we\nfound the agency\u2019s action arbitrary and capricious. See\nPortland Cement Association v. EPA, 665 F.3d 177 (D.C. Cir.\n2011). Following our ruling, EPA went back to the drawing\nboard and developed the emission standards at issue here, the\n2013 Rule.\n\n     Several environmental organizations, including the\nNatural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club, have\npetitioned for review of the 2013 Rule, arguing primarily that\ncertain aspects of the Rule contravene the Clean Air Act.\nThey also challenge EPA\u2019s decision to create an affirmative\ndefense for private civil suits in which plaintiffs sue sources\nof pollution and seek penalties for violations of emission\nstandards. EPA\u2019s affirmative defense would be available to\ndefendants in cases where an \u201cunavoidable\u201d malfunction had\nresulted in impermissible levels of emissions.\n\n    We conclude that the emissions-related provisions of\nEPA\u2019s 2013 Rule are permissible but that the affirmative\ndefense for private civil suits exceeds EPA\u2019s statutory\nauthority. We therefore grant the petitions in part and vacate\nthe portion of the Rule pertaining to the affirmative defense.\nWe deny the petitions in all other respects.\n\n                               I\n\n    Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412,\nrequires EPA to establish technology-based emission\nstandards for major sources of certain hazardous air\n\f                              4\npollutants. Emission standards must reflect \u201cthe maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions\u201d that EPA determines is\n\u201cachievable,\u201d taking into consideration \u201cthe cost of achieving\nsuch emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and\nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7412(d)(2). The resulting standards are commonly known\nas the \u201cmaximum achievable control technology,\u201d or\n\u201cMACT\u201d standards. See National Lime Association v. EPA,\n233 F.3d 625, 630 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n\n     EPA uses a two-step process for establishing MACT\nstandards. The agency begins by setting a minimum\nstringency level, or \u201cfloor,\u201d based on the results achieved by\nthe best-performing similar sources.          See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7412(d)(3). Once EPA sets the statutory floor, it then\ndetermines, considering cost and the other factors listed in\nSection 112(d)(2), whether a more restrictive standard is\n\u201cachievable,\u201d and if so then adopts that standard. EPA calls\nthese stricter requirements \u201cbeyond-the-floor\u201d standards.\nSierra Club v. EPA, 479 F.3d 875, 877 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n     When EPA sets an emission standard, it also determines a\nschedule for compliance with that standard. For existing\nsources, EPA must \u201cprovide for compliance as expeditiously\nas practicable, but in no event later than 3 years after the\neffective date\u201d of the emission standard.         42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7412(i)(3)(A).\n\n     In 2010, pursuant to its Section 112 authority, EPA\npromulgated National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants from the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry\nand Standards of Performance for Portland Cement Plants, 75\nFed. Reg. 54,970 (Sept. 9, 2010). That 2010 Rule set or\nrevised emissions limits for mercury, hydrogen chloride, total\nhydrocarbons (a surrogate for organic hazardous air pollutants\n\f                              5\nsuch as benzene and formaldehyde), and particulate matter (a\nsurrogate for certain non-mercury metals). Cement plants\nwould be required to comply with the new standards\nbeginning in September 2013. 75 Fed. Reg. at 54,993.\n\n     In addition to establishing emission standards, the 2010\nRule created an affirmative defense in private civil suits when\nviolations of the standards occurred because of \u201cunavoidable\u201d\nmalfunctions. See id. at 54,993, 55,053. The affirmative\ndefense replaced a previous EPA policy creating an\nexemption from emissions limitations during malfunction\nevents. In a prior decision, this Court struck down that\nexemption because it was inconsistent with the requirement\nthat emission standards apply continuously. See Sierra Club\nv. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1027-28 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n     Industry groups petitioned this Court for review and we\nfound the 2010 Rule arbitrary and capricious and remanded to\nEPA. We ruled specifically that, in calculating the floor for\nMACT purposes, EPA had arbitrarily included in its dataset\ninformation from cement kilns properly classified as\ncommercial incinerators, which are regulated under a separate\nprovision of the Act. See Portland Cement Association v.\nEPA, 665 F.3d 177, 186-89 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n     In our 2011 decision, however, we did not vacate the\nemission standards set forth in the 2010 Rule or stay its\nimplementation pending EPA\u2019s reconsideration process,\nstating that \u201cit is unlikely that significant changes will be\nmade to the standards upon reconsideration.\u201d Id. at 189.\n\n     On remand, however, EPA made several relevant\nchanges to the Portland cement emission standards. See\nNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for\nthe Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry and Standards of\n\f                              6\nPerformance for Portland Cement Plants, 78 Fed. Reg. 10,006\n(Feb. 12, 2013) (the 2013 Rule).\n\n     First, consistent with our Portland Cement opinion, EPA\nrevised its dataset to exclude commercial incinerators. When\nrecalculated using the revised data, the maximum emissions\nlevel for particulate matter \u2013 the floor \u2013 was ultimately\nrevised from 0.04 lb/ton to 0.07 lb/ton of clinker for existing\nkilns. See id. at 10,017-19. And EPA declined to re-adopt the\nmore stringent, 0.04 lb/ton limit of the 2010 Rule as a\nbeyond-the-floor standard.       The agency reasoned that\nachieving that additional increment of particulate reduction\nwould not be cost effective on a cost-per-ton basis. See id. at\n10,020-21.\n\n     Second, citing additional compliance strategies afforded\ncement manufacturers by the revised particulate standard,\nEPA established a new compliance date of September 2015\nfor that standard. See id. at 10,014. EPA further concluded\nthat although the emissions limits for mercury, hydrochloric\nacid, and hydrocarbons remained the same as in the 2010\nRule, the new September 2015 compliance date would also\napply to those emission standards. According to EPA,\ncoordinating the compliance date for particulate matter,\nmercury, hydrochloric acid, and hydrocarbons was essential\nbecause the latter standards \u201call typically involve some\nelement of [particulate matter] generation and capture and so\nthe controls must be integrated with [particulate matter]\ncontrol strategies.\u201d Id. at 10,022.\n\n     The 2013 Rule also retained the affirmative defense for\nprivate civil suits when the defendant violated emission\nstandards due to an unavoidable malfunction. EPA explained\nthat in its view, the affirmative defense was necessary to\nresolve a \u201ctension\u201d between the Clean Air Act\u2019s requirement\n\f                               7\nthat emission standards apply at all times and the fact that\nemission limits may sometimes be exceeded for reasons\nbeyond the control of the source. See id. at 10,014.\n\n     NRDC, the Sierra Club, and other environmental\norganizations have petitioned for review of various aspects of\nthe 2013 Rule. In Part II of this opinion, we address\npetitioners\u2019 arguments regarding the emission standards for\nparticulate matter. In Part III, we address petitioners\u2019\nchallenge to the compliance schedule implementing some of\nthe 2013 Rule\u2019s emission standards. In Part IV, we consider\nwhether EPA\u2019s decision to create the affirmative defense to\ncivil penalties for certain malfunction-related events exceeds\nthe agency\u2019s statutory authority.\n\n                               II\n\n    We first consider petitioners\u2019 challenges to the emission\nstandards for particulate matter.\n\n                               A\n\n     The 2013 Rule ultimately set the emissions level for\nparticulate matter at 0.07 lb/ton of clinker for existing kilns.\nThe 2010 Rule had set the level at 0.04 lb/ton of clinker.\nPetitioners argue that the 2013 Rule weakens the particulate\nmatter standard in violation of Section 112(d)(7) of the Clean\nAir Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(7). That provision, titled \u201cOther\nrequirements preserved,\u201d states:\n\n       No emission standard or other requirement\n       promulgated under this section shall be interpreted,\n       construed or applied to diminish or replace the\n       requirements of a more stringent emission limitation\n       or other applicable requirement established pursuant to\n\f                              8\n       section 7411 of this title, part C or D of this\n       subchapter, or other authority of this chapter or a\n       standard issued under State authority.\n\n(emphases added). Petitioners maintain that EPA violated\nSection 112(d)(7) because the 2013 Rule\u2019s particulate matter\nstandards \u201cdiminish or replace\u201d the more stringent standards\nin the 2010 Rule.\n\n    EPA responds that such a reduction does not violate\nSection 112(d)(7). In EPA\u2019s view, the most natural reading of\nSection 112(d)(7) is that \u201cother authority\u201d refers to authority\nother than Section 112 and other than the parts of the Clean\nAir Act specifically enumerated in Section 112(d)(7). Stated\nanother way, EPA suggests that Section 112(d)(7) is simply a\nsavings clause that makes clear that Section 112 does not\nsupersede the requirements of other, more restrictive\nprovisions of the Act.\n\n     By contrast, petitioners say that \u201cother authority\u201d of the\nAct includes Section 112 itself, as well as other provisions in\nthe Act. Petitioners read the statute as an anti-backsliding\nrestriction on EPA\u2019s ability to voluntarily reduce the\nstringency of any emission standard issued under Section 112.\n\n     As EPA points out, however, when Congress has sought\nto include that sort of anti-backsliding provision in the Clean\nAir Act, it has done so directly and explicitly. Cf., e.g., 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(l) (\u201cThe Administrator shall not approve a\nrevision of a [State Implementation Plan] if the revision\nwould interfere with any applicable requirement concerning\nattainment and reasonable further progress\u201d); id. \u00a7 7502(e)\n(specifying pollution control requirements if \u201cthe\nAdministrator relaxes a national primary ambient air quality\nstandard\u201d). Section 112(d)(7) contains no such language.\nFurthermore, EPA argues that petitioners\u2019 interpretation of\n\f                              9\nSection 112(d)(7) would mean that any change to a rule\nissued under Section 112 \u2013 even a necessary change made just\nfor technical reasons or because there was a calculation error\n\u2013 would be impermissible if the change made the standard\nless stringent. EPA says that it would be extraordinary if the\nstatute precluded that kind of necessary change.\n\n     In wading through this back-and-forth, we ultimately\nneed not decide whether EPA\u2019s reading is the better or only\nreading of this statutory provision, but simply whether it is a\npermissible reading. EPA administers the Clean Air Act, and\nwe must defer to its reasonable interpretation of any\nambiguities in the statute. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC,\n467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984). Here, even if the statute does\nnot compel EPA\u2019s reading, and indeed even if EPA\u2019s reading\nis not the better reading, the statute at a minimum is\nsufficiently ambiguous on this point to permit EPA\u2019s reading\nof \u201cother authority.\u201d Because EPA\u2019s reading is at least\nreasonable, we reject petitioners\u2019 argument and rule for EPA\nat Chevron step two.\n\n                              B\n\n     Petitioners also contend that EPA should have set a more\nrestrictive particulate matter standard when considering\nwhether to set \u201cbeyond-the-floor\u201d standards. Petitioners\nargue in particular that EPA misinterpreted the statute to\nallow it to consider cost-effectiveness when setting beyond-\nthe-floor standards.\n\n     Under Section 112(d), EPA must require \u201cthe maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions\u201d that EPA determines is\n\u201cachievable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2). To determine that\nemission level, EPA first establishes a minimum stringency\nlevel, or \u201cfloor,\u201d based on the emission results achieved by\n\f                                10\nthe best-performing sources in the category at issue. See id.\n\u00a7 7412(d)(3). Once EPA sets the statutory floor, it then\ndetermines, based on cost and the other factors listed in\nSection 112(d)(2), whether a more restrictive, beyond-the-\nfloor standard is achievable.1\n\n     When it promulgated the 2013 Rule, EPA rejected\npetitioners\u2019 argument to set a 0.04 lb/ton limit as a beyond-\nthe-floor standard. 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,020. EPA estimated\nthat a beyond-the-floor standard set at the 0.04 lb/ton level\nwould result in a reduction of 138 tons of particulate matter\nper year, at a cost of $37 million. Id. Based on those\nestimates, EPA noted that the cost-effectiveness of the\npotential beyond-the-floor standard \u2013 $268,000 per ton of\nparticulate matter removed \u2013 was substantially lower than the\ncost-effectiveness of other emission standards previously\nrejected by EPA. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,021.\n\n     Petitioners take issue with EPA\u2019s consideration of cost-\neffectiveness as a component of the Section 112(d)(2) cost\nanalysis. Petitioners contend that \u201ccost\u201d for purposes of the\nstatute only concerns whether \u201cthe standard is too expensive\nfor industry to achieve,\u201d in essence, whether the standards\nwould bankrupt the industry. Pet\u2019rs Br. 34.\n\n\n    1\n       In relevant part, the statute reads: \u201cEmissions standards\npromulgated under this subsection and applicable to new or existing\nsources of hazardous air pollutants shall require the maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants\nsubject to this section (including a prohibition on such emissions,\nwhere achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration\nthe cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air\nquality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements,\ndetermines is achievable for new or existing sources in the category\nor subcategory . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2) (emphasis added).\n\f                               11\n     EPA says that Congress afforded it wide latitude in\ndeciding how to balance cost and other considerations when\ndetermining that maximum achievable reduction in emissions.\nAccording to EPA, Section 112 does not command EPA to\nuse a particular form of cost analysis. In taking cost into\naccount, EPA contends that it may determine whether the\nproposed emission levels would be cost-effective. Indeed,\nEPA notes that this Court has previously recognized EPA\u2019s\nauthority to consider cost-effectiveness in setting standards\nunder nearly identical provisions of the Clean Air Act. See,\ne.g., Husqvarna AB v. EPA, 254 F.3d 195, 200 (D.C. Cir.\n2001) (\u201cBecause section 213 does not mandate a specific\nmethod of cost analysis, we find reasonable the EPA\u2019s choice\nto consider costs on the per ton of emissions removed\nbasis.\u201d); National Association of Clean Water Agencies v.\nEPA, 734 F.3d 1115, 1156-57 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citing\nHusqvarna; EPA could consider cost-effectiveness in setting\na beyond-the-floor standard under Section 129(a)(2) of the\nAct).\n\n      Again on this issue as with the first, we need not decide\nwhether EPA\u2019s reading is the only reading of this provision.\nEven if the statute does not compel EPA\u2019s approach, and even\nif EPA\u2019s reading is not the better reading, we conclude that it\nis still at least a reasonable reading given the various potential\nmeanings of \u201ccost\u201d in this context. Therefore, we reject\npetitioners\u2019 argument that EPA was required to exclude\nconsideration of cost-effectiveness and to set a beyond-the-\nfloor standard of 0.04 lb/ton of clinker.\n\n                               III\n\n    Next, we consider petitioners\u2019 claim that EPA acted\nunreasonably in setting a compliance date of September 2015\n\f                              12\nfor the emission standards for particulate matter, mercury,\nhydrochloric acid, and hydrocarbons.\n\n     Under Section 112(i)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act, EPA\nmust require compliance with emission standards for existing\nsources \u201cas expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later\nthan 3 years after the effective date of such standard.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412(i)(3)(A). Petitioners here contend that EPA\nviolated this timing provision by \u201cextending\u201d the compliance\ndeadline for the 2010 Rule from September 2013 to\nSeptember 2015.\n\n     As applied to the particulate matter standard, there is a\nbasic flaw in petitioners\u2019 argument: The 2013 Rule did not\nsimply \u201cextend\u201d the deadline for complying with the 2010\nRule. Rather, the 2013 Rule established new particulate\nmatter standards with a new effective date of February 2013,\nand a new compliance date of September 2015. EPA\nconcluded that any earlier date of compliance would not be\npracticable because of the multi-year timeline for upgrading\nthe technology necessary to ensure compliance. See 78 Fed.\nReg. at 10,024. As we have ruled before, EPA may reset the\ncompliance date for an emission standard when it introduces a\nnew standard with a new effective date, as was the case for\nparticulate matter in the 2013 Rule. See NRDC v. EPA, 489\nF.3d 1364 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n     According to petitioners, even if EPA could change the\ncompliance date for the particulate matter standard, the\nagency could not do the same for the mercury, hydrochloric\nacid, and hydrocarbon standards. The 2010 Rule set the\nemission levels for those pollutants, and the 2013 Rule did not\nalter the emission levels for those pollutants. This situation\ndoes indeed present a bit of a conundrum. On the one hand,\nwe know under the terms of the statute that EPA has set a\n\f                               13\ncompliance date of 2015 as the date that is as expeditious as\npracticable for particulate matter. On the other hand, our\nprior decision did not vacate the prior 2010 Rule, and the\ncompliance date for the other pollutants as set forth in that\nRule would otherwise be 2013.\n\n     This conundrum is resolved when one realizes that it\nwould be irrational and even absurd to have different\ncompliance dates for the different pollutants. EPA explained\nthat the technology is such that it would be senseless to have\ndifferent compliance dates. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,024. Even\npetitioners do not deny that the compliance date for all the\npollutants should be the same. To be sure, they want 2013 not\n2015 as the compliance date. But they recognize the general\nundesirability of a compliance date of 2013 for some of the\npollutants and of 2015 for other pollutants. See Tr. of Oral\nArgument at 10-11. Finally and perhaps most importantly,\nour prior decision in this case also recognized, at least\nimplicitly, that there must be a single compliance date for all\nof the pollutants. See Portland Cement Association, 665 F.3d\nat 189. Our decision necessarily relied on an assumption that\nif EPA did not alter the level for any of the pollutants, the date\nwould be 2013. But if EPA changed the level for one of the\npollutants, the compliance date for all the pollutants would\nmove together. Petitioners\u2019 argument for a 2013 compliance\ndate would be inconsistent with our prior decision.\n\n   In short, we reject petitioners\u2019 argument about the 2015\ncompliance date.\n\n                               IV\n\n    We next consider petitioners\u2019 challenge to the affirmative\ndefense that EPA created for cases of \u201cunavoidable\u201d\nmalfunctions.\n\f                               14\n     Section 304(a) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a),\nallows individuals to file citizen suits in federal district court\nagainst sources that violate emission standards. Under the\nlaw as originally enacted, a court could order only injunctive\nrelief as a remedy for a violation. But as part of the 1990\namendments to the Act, Congress expanded the citizen suit\nprovision to give district courts authority to impose \u201cany\nappropriate civil penalties,\u201d which may include monetary\npenalties. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a).\n\n     In the 2010 Rule, EPA created an affirmative defense to\nSection 304(a) for certain emissions violations caused by\n\u201cunavoidable\u201d malfunctions. Under the affirmative defense,\nthe district court may assess penalties only if violators \u201cfail to\nmeet [their] burden of proving all of the requirements in the\naffirmative defense.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,039. EPA retained\nthe affirmative defense when it promulgated the 2013 Rule.\nSee 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.1344.\n\n    Petitioners now argue that the affirmative defense\nexceeds EPA\u2019s statutory authority and that it is for the courts\nto decide whether to create an affirmative defense in these\nprivate civil suits, not EPA. We agree.\n\n     The threshold question is whether petitioners have\nstanding to challenge EPA\u2019s adoption of the affirmative\ndefense. Petitioners are environmental associations with\nindividual members across the country. EPA\u2019s affirmative\ndefense would immunize certain emissions that petitioners\ncontend should be penalized. Some of petitioners\u2019 members\nwill suffer from those higher emissions, according to their\naffidavits. A ruling in their favor would prevent those\nemissions and help alleviate that harm. That\u2019s good enough.\nPetitioners have shown injury-in-fact, causation, and\nredressability, and they thus have standing under Article III.\n\f                               15\n     We turn, then, to the substance of petitioners\u2019 challenge\nto the affirmative defense.\n\n     Section 304(a) grants \u201cany person\u201d the right to\n\u201ccommence a civil action\u201d against any person \u201cwho is alleged\nto have violated (if there is evidence that the alleged violation\nhas been repeated) or to be in violation of\u201d an emission\nstandard or limitation under the Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7604(a). The statute further provides that the federal district\ncourts \u201cshall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount\nin controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such\nan emission standard or limitation . . . and to apply any\nappropriate civil penalties.\u201d Id.\n\n     When determining whether civil penalties are\nappropriate, district courts look to Section 113(e)(1) of the\nAct, which directs courts to \u201ctake into consideration (in\naddition to such other factors as justice may require) the size\nof the business, the economic impact of the penalty on the\nbusiness, the violator\u2019s full compliance history and good faith\nefforts to comply, the duration of the violation as established\nby any credible evidence . . . , payment by the violator of\npenalties previously assessed for the same violation, the\neconomic benefit of noncompliance, and the seriousness of\nthe violation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(e)(1).\n\n     Section 304(a) creates a private right of action, and as the\nSupreme Court has explained, \u201cthe Judiciary, not any\nexecutive agency, determines \u2018the scope\u2019 \u2013 including the\navailable remedies \u2013 \u2018of judicial power vested by\u2019 statutes\nestablishing private rights of action.\u201d City of Arlington v.\nFCC, 133 S. Ct. 1863, 1871 n.3 (2013) (emphasis added)\n(quoting Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, 494 U.S. 638, 650\n(1990)). Section 304(a) is in keeping with that principle. By\nits terms, Section 304(a) clearly vests authority over private\n\f                               16\nsuits in the courts, not EPA. As the language of the statute\nmakes clear, the courts determine, on a case-by-case basis,\nwhether civil penalties are \u201cappropriate.\u201d By contrast, EPA\u2019s\nability to determine whether penalties should be assessed for\nClean Air Act violations extends only to administrative\npenalties, not to civil penalties imposed by a court. See 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7413(d)(2)(B) (Administrator may \u201ccompromise,\nmodify, or remit, with or without conditions, any\nadministrative penalty\u201d). To the extent that the Clean Air Act\ncontemplates a role for EPA in private civil suits, it is only as\nan intervenor. See id. \u00a7 7604(c)(2). EPA also of course could\nseek to participate as an amicus curiae.\n\n     EPA argues that its proposed affirmative defense simply\nfleshes out the statutory requirement that penalties be applied\nonly when \u201cappropriate.\u201d But under this statute, deciding\nwhether penalties are \u201cappropriate\u201d in a given private civil\nsuit is a job for the courts, not for EPA. When a private suit is\nfiled, the defendant can argue that penalties should not be\nassessed, based on the factors in Section 113(e)(1) such as the\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cfull compliance history and good faith efforts to\ncomply.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7413(e)(1). EPA can support that argument as\nintervenor or amicus, to the extent such status is deemed\nappropriate by the relevant court. But under the statutory\nscheme, the decision whether to accept the defendant\u2019s\nargument is for the court in the first instance, not for EPA.\n\n     EPA alternatively contends that it is permitted to create\nthe affirmative defense because of Section 301(a)(1) of the\nClean Air Act. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,014. That provision\nauthorizes EPA\u2019s Administrator to \u201cprescribe such regulations\nas are necessary to carry out his functions under\u201d the Act. 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7601(a)(1). But we have consistently held that\nEPA\u2019s authority to issue ancillary regulations is not open-\nended, particularly when there is statutory language on point.\n\f                              17\nSee, e.g., American Petroleum Institute v. EPA, 52 F.3d 1113,\n1119 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (\u201cthe general grant of rulemaking\npower to EPA cannot trump specific portions of the CAA\u201d);\nNRDC v. Reilly, 976 F.2d 36, 41 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (EPA\ncannot use its general rulemaking authority as justification for\nadding to a statutorily specified list); Sierra Club v. EPA, 719\nF.2d 436, 453 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same); see also Gonzales v.\nOregon, 546 U.S. 243, 264-65 (2006) (\u201cIt would\ngo . . . against the plain language of the text to treat a\ndelegation for the \u2018execution\u2019 of [the Attorney General\u2019s]\nfunctions as a further delegation to define other functions well\nbeyond the statute\u2019s specific grants of authority.\u201d). Those\nprecedents establish a simple and sensible rule: EPA cannot\nrely on its gap-filling authority to supplement the Clean Air\nAct\u2019s provisions when Congress has not left the agency a gap\nto fill. So it is here.\n\n     On a different tack, EPA notes that Section 304(a)(1)\ndoes not expressly deny EPA the ability to create an\naffirmative defense, and EPA emphasizes that this Court has\nfrequently recognized the need for flexibility in the\nadministrative process. EPA Br. 46. That\u2019s true. But the\nsuggestion implicit in EPA\u2019s argument \u2013 that we should\n\u201cpresume a delegation of power absent an express\nwithholding of such power\u201d \u2013 is \u201cplainly out of keeping with\nChevron . . . .\u201d Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Association v.\nNational Mediation Board, 29 F.3d 655, 671 (D.C. Cir. 1994)\n(en banc).\n\n    Finally, EPA suggests that an affirmative defense for\nmalfunctions is necessary to account for the tension between\nrequirements that emissions limitations be \u201ccontinuous\u201d and\nthe practical reality that control technology can fail\nunavoidably. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,014. That is a good\nargument for EPA to make to the courts \u2013 and for the courts\n\f                               18\nto then consider \u2013 in future civil cases when this issue arises.\nBut it does not suffice to give EPA authority to create an\naffirmative defense.2\n\n                              ***\n\n     We grant the petitions for review with regard to EPA\u2019s\naffirmative defense and vacate those portions of the 2013\nRule pertaining to the defense.

The basic process for making Portland\ncement is much the same today as it was when the material\nwas first developed nearly 200 years ago.              Cement\nmanufacturers pulverize limestone and minerals, and then\nheat those raw materials to several thousand degrees. The\nresulting substance, called clinker, is then cooled and ground\ninto a fine gray powder. This powder \u2013 called Portland\ncement \u2013 is later combined with sand, rocks, and water to\nmake concrete.\n\n    The grinding and heating involved in cement\nmanufacturing has an unfortunate side effect: It releases into\nthe air a number of hazardous air pollutants, most notably\n\f                              3\nmercury, hydrochloric acid, hydrocarbons, and particulate\nmatter. This case concerns EPA\u2019s efforts to develop rules\nunder the Clean Air Act to limit emissions of those pollutants\nfrom cement plants.\n\n     In a previous decision, we considered EPA\u2019s first attempt\nto create emission standards for the cement industry, and we\nfound the agency\u2019s action arbitrary and capricious. See\nPortland Cement Association v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618634\"><a href=\"/opinion/618634/portland-cement-assn-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir.\n2011). Following our ruling, EPA went back to the drawing\nboard and developed the emission standards at issue here, the\n2013 Rule.\n\n     Several environmental organizations, including the\nNatural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club, have\npetitioned for review of the 2013 Rule, arguing primarily that\ncertain aspects of the Rule contravene the Clean Air Act.\nThey also challenge EPA\u2019s decision to create an affirmative\ndefense for private civil suits in which plaintiffs sue sources\nof pollution and seek penalties for violations of emission\nstandards. EPA\u2019s affirmative defense would be available to\ndefendants in cases where an \u201cunavoidable\u201d malfunction had\nresulted in impermissible levels of emissions.\n\n    We conclude that the emissions-related provisions of\nEPA\u2019s 2013 Rule are permissible but that the affirmative\ndefense for private civil suits exceeds EPA\u2019s statutory\nauthority. We therefore grant the petitions in part and vacate\nthe portion of the Rule pertaining to the affirmative defense.\nWe deny the petitions in all other respects.\n\n                               I\n\n    Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412,\nrequires EPA to establish technology-based emission\nstandards for major sources of certain hazardous air\n\f                              4\npollutants. Emission standards must reflect \u201cthe maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions\u201d that EPA determines is\n\u201cachievable,\u201d taking into consideration \u201cthe cost of achieving\nsuch emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and\nenvironmental impacts and energy requirements.\u201d 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7412(d)(2). The resulting standards are commonly known\nas the \u201cmaximum achievable control technology,\u201d or\n\u201cMACT\u201d standards. See National Lime Association v.

The agency begins by setting a minimum\nstringency level, or \u201cfloor,\u201d based on the results achieved by\nthe best-performing similar sources.          See 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7412(d)(3). Once EPA sets the statutory floor, it then\ndetermines, considering cost and the other factors listed in\nSection 112(d)(2), whether a more restrictive standard is\n\u201cachievable,\u201d and if so then adopts that standard. EPA calls\nthese stricter requirements \u201cbeyond-the-floor\u201d standards.\nSierra Club v.

Cir. 2007).\n\n     When EPA sets an emission standard, it also determines a\nschedule for compliance with that standard. For existing\nsources, EPA must \u201cprovide for compliance as expeditiously\nas practicable, but in no event later than 3 years after the\neffective date\u201d of the emission standard.         42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7412(i)(3)(A).\n\n     In 2010, pursuant to its Section 112 authority, EPA\npromulgated National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants from the Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry\nand Standards of Performance for Portland Cement Plants, 75\nFed. Reg. 54,970 (Sept. 9, 2010). That 2010 Rule set or\nrevised emissions limits for mercury, hydrogen chloride, total\nhydrocarbons (a surrogate for organic hazardous air pollutants\n\f                              5\nsuch as benzene and formaldehyde), and particulate matter (a\nsurrogate for certain non-mercury metals).

See id. at 54,993, 55,053. The affirmative\ndefense replaced a previous EPA policy creating an\nexemption from emissions limitations during malfunction\nevents.

See Portland Cement Association v.\nEPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618634\"><a href=\"/opinion/618634/portland-cement-assn-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186-89 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\n     In our 2011 decision, however, we did not vacate the\nemission standards set forth in the 2010 Rule or stay its\nimplementation pending EPA\u2019s reconsideration process,\nstating that \u201cit is unlikely that significant changes will be\nmade to the standards upon reconsideration.\u201d Id. at 189.\n\n     On remand, however, EPA made several relevant\nchanges to the Portland cement emission standards. See\nNational Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for\nthe Portland Cement Manufacturing Industry and Standards of\n\f                              6\nPerformance for Portland Cement Plants, 78 Fed. Reg. 10,006\n(Feb. 12, 2013) (the 2013 Rule).\n\n     First, consistent with our Portland Cement opinion, EPA\nrevised its dataset to exclude commercial incinerators. When\nrecalculated using the revised data, the maximum emissions\nlevel for particulate matter \u2013 the floor \u2013 was ultimately\nrevised from 0.04 lb/ton to 0.07 lb/ton of clinker for existing\nkilns. See id. at 10,017-19. And EPA declined to re-adopt the\nmore stringent, 0.04 lb/ton limit of the 2010 Rule as a\nbeyond-the-floor standard.       The agency reasoned that\nachieving that additional increment of particulate reduction\nwould not be cost effective on a cost-per-ton basis. See id. at\n10,020-21.\n\n     Second, citing additional compliance strategies afforded\ncement manufacturers by the revised particulate standard,\nEPA established a new compliance date of September 2015\nfor that standard. See id. at 10,014. EPA further concluded\nthat although the emissions limits for mercury, hydrochloric\nacid, and hydrocarbons remained the same as in the 2010\nRule, the new September 2015 compliance date would also\napply to those emission standards. According to EPA,\ncoordinating the compliance date for particulate matter,\nmercury, hydrochloric acid, and hydrocarbons was essential\nbecause the latter standards \u201call typically involve some\nelement of [particulate matter] generation and capture and so\nthe controls must be integrated with [particulate matter]\ncontrol strategies.\u201d Id. at 10,022.\n\n     The 2013 Rule also retained the affirmative defense for\nprivate civil suits when the defendant violated emission\nstandards due to an unavoidable malfunction. EPA explained\nthat in its view, the affirmative defense was necessary to\nresolve a \u201ctension\u201d between the Clean Air Act\u2019s requirement\n\f                               7\nthat emission standards apply at all times and the fact that\nemission limits may sometimes be exceeded for reasons\nbeyond the control of the source. See id. at 10,014.\n\n     NRDC, the Sierra Club, and other environmental\norganizations have petitioned for review of various aspects of\nthe 2013 Rule. In Part II of this opinion, we address\npetitioners\u2019 arguments regarding the emission standards for\nparticulate matter. In Part III, we address petitioners\u2019\nchallenge to the compliance schedule implementing some of\nthe 2013 Rule\u2019s emission standards. In Part IV, we consider\nwhether EPA\u2019s decision to create the affirmative defense to\ncivil penalties for certain malfunction-related events exceeds\nthe agency\u2019s statutory authority.\n\n                               II\n\n    We first consider petitioners\u2019 challenges to the emission\nstandards for particulate matter.\n\n                               A\n\n     The 2013 Rule ultimately set the emissions level for\nparticulate matter at 0.07 lb/ton of clinker for existing kilns.\nThe 2010 Rule had set the level at 0.04 lb/ton of clinker.\nPetitioners argue that the 2013 Rule weakens the particulate\nmatter standard in violation of Section 112(d)(7) of the Clean\nAir Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(7). That provision, titled \u201cOther\nrequirements preserved,\u201d states:\n\n       No emission standard or other requirement\n       promulgated under this section shall be interpreted,\n       construed or applied to diminish or replace the\n       requirements of a more stringent emission limitation\n       or other applicable requirement established pursuant to\n\f                              8\n       section 7411 of this title, part C or D of this\n       subchapter, or other authority of this chapter or a\n       standard issued under State authority.\n\n(emphases added). Petitioners maintain that EPA violated\nSection 112(d)(7) because the 2013 Rule\u2019s particulate matter\nstandards \u201cdiminish or replace\u201d the more stringent standards\nin the 2010 Rule.\n\n    EPA responds that such a reduction does not violate\nSection 112(d)(7). In EPA\u2019s view, the most natural reading of\nSection 112(d)(7) is that \u201cother authority\u201d refers to authority\nother than Section 112 and other than the parts of the Clean\nAir Act specifically enumerated in Section 112(d)(7). Stated\nanother way, EPA suggests that Section 112(d)(7) is simply a\nsavings clause that makes clear that Section 112 does not\nsupersede the requirements of other, more restrictive\nprovisions of the Act.\n\n     By contrast, petitioners say that \u201cother authority\u201d of the\nAct includes Section 112 itself, as well as other provisions in\nthe Act. Petitioners read the statute as an anti-backsliding\nrestriction on EPA\u2019s ability to voluntarily reduce the\nstringency of any emission standard issued under Section 112.\n\n     As EPA points out, however, when Congress has sought\nto include that sort of anti-backsliding provision in the Clean\nAir Act, it has done so directly and explicitly. Cf., e.g., 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(l) (\u201cThe Administrator shall not approve a\nrevision of a [State Implementation Plan] if the revision\nwould interfere with any applicable requirement concerning\nattainment and reasonable further progress\u201d); id. \u00a7 7502(e)\n(specifying pollution control requirements if \u201cthe\nAdministrator relaxes a national primary ambient air quality\nstandard\u201d). Section 112(d)(7) contains no such language.\nFurthermore, EPA argues that petitioners\u2019 interpretation of\n\f                              9\nSection 112(d)(7) would mean that any change to a rule\nissued under Section 112 \u2013 even a necessary change made just\nfor technical reasons or because there was a calculation error\n\u2013 would be impermissible if the change made the standard\nless stringent. EPA says that it would be extraordinary if the\nstatute precluded that kind of necessary change.\n\n     In wading through this back-and-forth, we ultimately\nneed not decide whether EPA\u2019s reading is the better or only\nreading of this statutory provision, but simply whether it is a\npermissible reading. EPA administers the Clean Air Act, and\nwe must defer to its reasonable interpretation of any\nambiguities in the statute. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 843-44 (1984). Here, even if the statute does\nnot compel EPA\u2019s reading, and indeed even if EPA\u2019s reading\nis not the better reading, the statute at a minimum is\nsufficiently ambiguous on this point to permit EPA\u2019s reading\nof \u201cother authority.\u201d Because EPA\u2019s reading is at least\nreasonable, we reject petitioners\u2019 argument and rule for EPA\nat Chevron step two.\n\n                              B\n\n     Petitioners also contend that EPA should have set a more\nrestrictive particulate matter standard when considering\nwhether to set \u201cbeyond-the-floor\u201d standards. Petitioners\nargue in particular that EPA misinterpreted the statute to\nallow it to consider cost-effectiveness when setting beyond-\nthe-floor standards.\n\n     Under Section 112(d), EPA must require \u201cthe maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions\u201d that EPA determines is\n\u201cachievable.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2). To determine that\nemission level, EPA first establishes a minimum stringency\nlevel, or \u201cfloor,\u201d based on the emission results achieved by\n\f                                10\nthe best-performing sources in the category at issue. See id.\n\u00a7 7412(d)(3). Once EPA sets the statutory floor, it then\ndetermines, based on cost and the other factors listed in\nSection 112(d)(2), whether a more restrictive, beyond-the-\nfloor standard is achievable.1\n\n     When it promulgated the 2013 Rule, EPA rejected\npetitioners\u2019 argument to set a 0.04 lb/ton limit as a beyond-\nthe-floor standard. 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,020. EPA estimated\nthat a beyond-the-floor standard set at the 0.04 lb/ton level\nwould result in a reduction of 138 tons of particulate matter\nper year, at a cost of $37 million. Id. Based on those\nestimates, EPA noted that the cost-effectiveness of the\npotential beyond-the-floor standard \u2013 $268,000 per ton of\nparticulate matter removed \u2013 was substantially lower than the\ncost-effectiveness of other emission standards previously\nrejected by EPA. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,021.\n\n     Petitioners take issue with EPA\u2019s consideration of cost-\neffectiveness as a component of the Section 112(d)(2) cost\nanalysis. Petitioners contend that \u201ccost\u201d for purposes of the\nstatute only concerns whether \u201cthe standard is too expensive\nfor industry to achieve,\u201d in essence, whether the standards\nwould bankrupt the industry. Pet\u2019rs Br. 34.\n\n\n    1\n       In relevant part, the statute reads: \u201cEmissions standards\npromulgated under this subsection and applicable to new or existing\nsources of hazardous air pollutants shall require the maximum\ndegree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants\nsubject to this section (including a prohibition on such emissions,\nwhere achievable) that the Administrator, taking into consideration\nthe cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air\nquality health and environmental impacts and energy requirements,\ndetermines is achievable for new or existing sources in the category\nor subcategory . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412(d)(2) (emphasis added).\n\f                               11\n     EPA says that Congress afforded it wide latitude in\ndeciding how to balance cost and other considerations when\ndetermining that maximum achievable reduction in emissions.\nAccording to EPA, Section 112 does not command EPA to\nuse a particular form of cost analysis. In taking cost into\naccount, EPA contends that it may determine whether the\nproposed emission levels would be cost-effective. Indeed,\nEPA notes that this Court has previously recognized EPA\u2019s\nauthority to consider cost-effectiveness in setting standards\nunder nearly identical provisions of the Clean Air Act. See,\ne.g., Husqvarna AB v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185414\"><a href=\"/opinion/185414/husqvarna-ab-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (D.C.

Cir. 2013) (citing\nHusqvarna; EPA could consider cost-effectiveness in setting\na beyond-the-floor standard under Section 129(a)(2) of the\nAct).\n\n      Again on this issue as with the first, we need not decide\nwhether EPA\u2019s reading is the only reading of this provision.\nEven if the statute does not compel EPA\u2019s approach, and even\nif EPA\u2019s reading is not the better reading, we conclude that it\nis still at least a reasonable reading given the various potential\nmeanings of \u201ccost\u201d in this context. Therefore, we reject\npetitioners\u2019 argument that EPA was required to exclude\nconsideration of cost-effectiveness and to set a beyond-the-\nfloor standard of 0.04 lb/ton of clinker.\n\n                               III\n\n    Next, we consider petitioners\u2019 claim that EPA acted\nunreasonably in setting a compliance date of September 2015\n\f                              12\nfor the emission standards for particulate matter, mercury,\nhydrochloric acid, and hydrocarbons.\n\n     Under Section 112(i)(3)(A) of the Clean Air Act, EPA\nmust require compliance with emission standards for existing\nsources \u201cas expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later\nthan 3 years after the effective date of such standard.\u201d 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7412(i)(3)(A). Petitioners here contend that EPA\nviolated this timing provision by \u201cextending\u201d the compliance\ndeadline for the 2010 Rule from September 2013 to\nSeptember 2015.\n\n     As applied to the particulate matter standard, there is a\nbasic flaw in petitioners\u2019 argument: The 2013 Rule did not\nsimply \u201cextend\u201d the deadline for complying with the 2010\nRule. Rather, the 2013 Rule established new particulate\nmatter standards with a new effective date of February 2013,\nand a new compliance date of September 2015. EPA\nconcluded that any earlier date of compliance would not be\npracticable because of the multi-year timeline for upgrading\nthe technology necessary to ensure compliance. See 78 Fed.\nReg. at 10,024. As we have ruled before, EPA may reset the\ncompliance date for an emission standard when it introduces a\nnew standard with a new effective date, as was the case for\nparticulate matter in the 2013 Rule. See NRDC v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186945\"><a href=\"/opinion/186945/nat-resrc-def-cncl-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n\n     According to petitioners, even if EPA could change the\ncompliance date for the particulate matter standard, the\nagency could not do the same for the mercury, hydrochloric\nacid, and hydrocarbon standards. The 2010 Rule set the\nemission levels for those pollutants, and the 2013 Rule did not\nalter the emission levels for those pollutants. This situation\ndoes indeed present a bit of a conundrum. On the one hand,\nwe know under the terms of the statute that EPA has set a\n\f                               13\ncompliance date of 2015 as the date that is as expeditious as\npracticable for particulate matter. On the other hand, our\nprior decision did not vacate the prior 2010 Rule, and the\ncompliance date for the other pollutants as set forth in that\nRule would otherwise be 2013.\n\n     This conundrum is resolved when one realizes that it\nwould be irrational and even absurd to have different\ncompliance dates for the different pollutants. EPA explained\nthat the technology is such that it would be senseless to have\ndifferent compliance dates. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,024. Even\npetitioners do not deny that the compliance date for all the\npollutants should be the same. To be sure, they want 2013 not\n2015 as the compliance date. But they recognize the general\nundesirability of a compliance date of 2013 for some of the\npollutants and of 2015 for other pollutants. See Tr. of Oral\nArgument at 10-11. Finally and perhaps most importantly,\nour prior decision in this case also recognized, at least\nimplicitly, that there must be a single compliance date for all\nof the pollutants. See Portland Cement Association, 665 F.3d\nat 189. Our decision necessarily relied on an assumption that\nif EPA did not alter the level for any of the pollutants, the date\nwould be 2013. But if EPA changed the level for one of the\npollutants, the compliance date for all the pollutants would\nmove together. Petitioners\u2019 argument for a 2013 compliance\ndate would be inconsistent with our prior decision.\n\n   In short, we reject petitioners\u2019 argument about the 2015\ncompliance date.\n\n                               IV\n\n    We next consider petitioners\u2019 challenge to the affirmative\ndefense that EPA created for cases of \u201cunavoidable\u201d\nmalfunctions.\n\f                               14\n     Section 304(a) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a),\nallows individuals to file citizen suits in federal district court\nagainst sources that violate emission standards. Under the\nlaw as originally enacted, a court could order only injunctive\nrelief as a remedy for a violation. But as part of the 1990\namendments to the Act, Congress expanded the citizen suit\nprovision to give district courts authority to impose \u201cany\nappropriate civil penalties,\u201d which may include monetary\npenalties. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604(a).\n\n     In the 2010 Rule, EPA created an affirmative defense to\nSection 304(a) for certain emissions violations caused by\n\u201cunavoidable\u201d malfunctions. Under the affirmative defense,\nthe district court may assess penalties only if violators \u201cfail to\nmeet [their] burden of proving all of the requirements in the\naffirmative defense.\u201d 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,039. EPA retained\nthe affirmative defense when it promulgated the 2013 Rule.\nSee 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 63.1344.\n\n    Petitioners now argue that the affirmative defense\nexceeds EPA\u2019s statutory authority and that it is for the courts\nto decide whether to create an affirmative defense in these\nprivate civil suits, not EPA. We agree.\n\n     The threshold question is whether petitioners have\nstanding to challenge EPA\u2019s adoption of the affirmative\ndefense. Petitioners are environmental associations with\nindividual members across the country. EPA\u2019s affirmative\ndefense would immunize certain emissions that petitioners\ncontend should be penalized. Some of petitioners\u2019 members\nwill suffer from those higher emissions, according to their\naffidavits. A ruling in their favor would prevent those\nemissions and help alleviate that harm. That\u2019s good enough.\nPetitioners have shown injury-in-fact, causation, and\nredressability, and they thus have standing under Article III.\n\f                               15\n     We turn, then, to the substance of petitioners\u2019 challenge\nto the affirmative defense.\n\n     Section 304(a) grants \u201cany person\u201d the right to\n\u201ccommence a civil action\u201d against any person \u201cwho is alleged\nto have violated (if there is evidence that the alleged violation\nhas been repeated) or to be in violation of\u201d an emission\nstandard or limitation under the Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 7604(a). The statute further provides that the federal district\ncourts \u201cshall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount\nin controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce such\nan emission standard or limitation . . . and to apply any\nappropriate civil penalties.\u201d Id.\n\n     When determining whether civil penalties are\nappropriate, district courts look to Section 113(e)(1) of the\nAct, which directs courts to \u201ctake into consideration (in\naddition to such other factors as justice may require) the size\nof the business, the economic impact of the penalty on the\nbusiness, the violator\u2019s full compliance history and good faith\nefforts to comply, the duration of the violation as established\nby any credible evidence . . . , payment by the violator of\npenalties previously assessed for the same violation, the\neconomic benefit of noncompliance, and the seriousness of\nthe violation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7413(e)(1).\n\n     Section 304(a) creates a private right of action, and as the\nSupreme Court has explained, \u201cthe Judiciary, not any\nexecutive agency, determines \u2018the scope\u2019 \u2013 including the\navailable remedies \u2013 \u2018of judicial power vested by\u2019 statutes\nestablishing private rights of action.\u201d City of Arlington v.\nFCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"868384\"><a href=\"/opinion/868384/arlington-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Section 304(a) is in keeping with that principle. By\nits terms, Section 304(a) clearly vests authority over private\n\f                               16\nsuits in the courts, not EPA. As the language of the statute\nmakes clear, the courts determine, on a case-by-case basis,\nwhether civil penalties are \u201cappropriate.\u201d By contrast, EPA\u2019s\nability to determine whether penalties should be assessed for\nClean Air Act violations extends only to administrative\npenalties, not to civil penalties imposed by a court. See 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7413(d)(2)(B) (Administrator may \u201ccompromise,\nmodify, or remit, with or without conditions, any\nadministrative penalty\u201d). To the extent that the Clean Air Act\ncontemplates a role for EPA in private civil suits, it is only as\nan intervenor. See id. \u00a7 7604(c)(2). EPA also of course could\nseek to participate as an amicus curiae.\n\n     EPA argues that its proposed affirmative defense simply\nfleshes out the statutory requirement that penalties be applied\nonly when \u201cappropriate.\u201d But under this statute, deciding\nwhether penalties are \u201cappropriate\u201d in a given private civil\nsuit is a job for the courts, not for EPA. When a private suit is\nfiled, the defendant can argue that penalties should not be\nassessed, based on the factors in Section 113(e)(1) such as the\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cfull compliance history and good faith efforts to\ncomply.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7413(e)(1). EPA can support that argument as\nintervenor or amicus, to the extent such status is deemed\nappropriate by the relevant court. But under the statutory\nscheme, the decision whether to accept the defendant\u2019s\nargument is for the court in the first instance, not for EPA.\n\n     EPA alternatively contends that it is permitted to create\nthe affirmative defense because of Section 301(a)(1) of the\nClean Air Act. See 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,014. That provision\nauthorizes EPA\u2019s Administrator to \u201cprescribe such regulations\nas are necessary to carry out his functions under\u201d the Act. 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 7601(a)(1).

Those\nprecedents establish a simple and sensible rule: EPA cannot\nrely on its gap-filling authority to supplement the Clean Air\nAct\u2019s provisions when Congress has not left the agency a gap\nto fill. So it is here.\n\n     On a different tack, EPA notes that Section 304(a)(1)\ndoes not expressly deny EPA the ability to create an\naffirmative defense, and EPA emphasizes that this Court has\nfrequently recognized the need for flexibility in the\nadministrative process. EPA Br. 46. That\u2019s true. But the\nsuggestion implicit in EPA\u2019s argument \u2013 that we should\n\u201cpresume a delegation of power absent an express\nwithholding of such power\u201d \u2013 is \u201cplainly out of keeping with\nChevron . . . .\u201d Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Association v.\nNational Mediation Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"674584\"><a href=\"/opinion/674584/railway-labor-executives-association-american-railway-and-airway/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671 (D.C.

See 78 Fed. Reg. at 10,014. That is a good\nargument for EPA to make to the courts \u2013 and for the courts\n\f                               18\nto then consider \u2013 in future civil cases when this issue arises.\nBut it does not suffice to give EPA authority to create an\naffirmative defense.2\n\n                              ***\n\n     We grant the petitions for review with regard to EPA\u2019s\naffirmative defense and vacate those portions of the 2013\nRule pertaining to the defense.
