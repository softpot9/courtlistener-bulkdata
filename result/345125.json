Rotundo's recalcitrance occurred despite his having been granted use immunity by the district court pursuant to the written motion signed by the Acting United States Attorney.  We have examined all of the assertions of error asserted by appellant and find them to be without merit.  Accordingly, the judgment holding appellant in contempt of court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rotundo challenges the authority of the Acting United States Attorney to request the grant of use immunity upon him as a witness.  He contends that the United States Attorney alone may lawfully make such a motion on behalf of the Government.  However, the United States Attorney specifically designated his Chief Assistant, Mr. Antle, in writing to perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney during his absence pursuant to 28 C.F.R. sec. 0.131.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In our view, this was adequate to comply with 18 U.S.C. sec. 6003<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> pertaining to a motion to order an individual to give testimony despite his privilege against self-incrimination upon the grant of immunity as provided by 18 U.S.C. sec. 6002.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See United States v. Smith, 10 Cir. 1976, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334069\"><a href=\"/opinion/334069/united-states-v-elijah-dewayne-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span> which approved the designation of an Acting Assistant United States Attorney to perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney as specifically authorized by 28 C.F.R. sec. 0.131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant further asserts as error the failure of the trial court to grant an evidentiary hearing to permit him to show taint from a New York electronic surveillance.  It is clear from the record that neither the prosecutor nor the FBI Agent assisting him had any prior knowledge of the New York interceptions and that they had just been informed thereof before hearing of this contempt proceeding.  The Government's counsel (Mr. Steinberg) specifically denied in open court that any information from the New York surveillance was used in connection with questions propounded to Rotundo before the grand jury.  It was stipulated that Mr. Heist, the FBI Agent assisting the prosecutor, would similarly testify.  An affidavit by Mr. Steinberg, Special Attorney for the United States in charge of the investigation concerning Rotundo, to the same effect was filed in the record herein.  The affidavit averred that the only electronic surveillance used by the Government was that referred to in the case of United States v. Sklaroff which was not connected with the New York surveillance.  Lawfulness of that intercept has recently been affirmed by us in United States v. Sklaroff, 5 Cir. 1977, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"344494\"><a href=\"/opinion/344494/united-states-v-martin-sklaroff-reuben-goldstein-and-pearl-leppo-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1156</span></a></span>.  There was no evidence to the contrary of that produced by the Government and no reason to believe otherwise.  See In re: Lochiatto, 1 Cir. 1974, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"319512\"><a href=\"/opinion/319512/in-re-barbara-lochiatto-in-re-patrick-lochiatto-in-re-john-e-dunn/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">803</span></a></span>; In re: Millow, 2 Cir. 1976, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"332958\"><a href=\"/opinion/332958/in-re-francis-joseph-millow/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span>.  Thus, the assertion of error is without merit, there being no need for an evidentiary hearing under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is further charged that the trial court erred and failed to hold that the government's application for disclosure under 18 U.S.C. sec. 2517(5) was insufficient and that being true the questions to the witness Rotundo before the grand jury were illegal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, appellant contends that he asserted \"a complete defense\" to the contempt proceeding.  We have examined the Government's application to use the contents of wire interceptions relating to offenses other than those specified in the intercept order as well as the order of Judge King granting the Government's motion for disclosure.  In our view, there has been sufficient compliance with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. sec. 2517(5).  We reject, therefore, the contention that the disclosure was insufficient.  Read with the Government's application, Judge King's order is ample.  Nor is the Government's application defective for failure to be supported by oath and affirmation.  There is no requirement in the subsection requiring an oath or affirmation.  We are also satisfied that the application was made \"as soon as practicable\" under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Rule 18, 5 Cir.; see Isbell Enterprises, Inc. v.
