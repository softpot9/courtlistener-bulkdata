The scope of these orders2 was stated as follows:\n\n       The products covered by the order are new pneumatic tires designed for off-the-road\n       (OTR) and off-highway use, subject to exceptions identified below. Certain OTR tires\n       are generally designed, manufactured and offered for sale for use on off-road or\n       off-highway surfaces, including but not limited to, agricultural fields, forests,\n       construction sites, factory and warehouse interiors, airport tarmacs, ports and harbors,\n       mines, quarries, gravel yards, and steel mills. The vehicles and equipment for which\n       certain OTR tires are designed for use include, but are not limited to: (1) Agricultural and\n       forestry vehicles and equipment, including agricultural tractors, combine harvesters,\n       agricultural high clearance sprayers, industrial tractors, log-skidders, agricultural\n       implements, highway-towed implements, agricultural logging, and agricultural,\n       industrial, skid-steers/mini-loaders; (2) construction vehicles and equipment, including\n       earthmover articulated dump products, rigid frame haul trucks, front end loaders, dozers,\n       lift trucks, straddle carriers, graders, mobile cranes, compactors; and (3) industrial\n       vehicles and equipment, including smooth floor, industrial, mining, counterbalanced lift\n       trucks, industrial and mining vehicles other than smooth floor, skid-steers/mini-loaders,\n       and smooth floor off-the-road counterbalanced lift trucks. The foregoing list of vehicles\n       and equipment generally have in common that they are used for hauling, towing, lifting,\n       and/or loading a wide variety of equipment and materials in agricultural, construction and\n       industrial settings. Such vehicles and equipment, and the descriptions contained in the\n       footnotes are illustrative of the types of vehicles and equipment that use certain OTR\n       tires, but are not necessarily all-inclusive. While the physical characteristics of certain\n       OTR tires will vary depending on the specific applications and conditions for which the\n       tires are designed (e.g., tread pattern and depth), all of the tires within the scope have in\n       common that they are designed for off-road and off-highway use. Except as discussed\n       below, OTR tires included in the scope of the order range in size (rim diameter) generally\n       but not exclusively from 8 inches to 54 inches. The tires may be either tube-type or\n       tubeless, radial or non-radial, and intended for sale either to original equipment\n       manufacturers or the replacement market. The subject merchandise is currently\n       classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (\u201cHTSUS\u201d)\n       subheadings: 4011.20.10.25, 4011.20.10.35, 4011.20.50.30, 4011.20.50.50,\n       4011.61.00.00, 4011.62.00.00, 4011.63.00.00, 4011.69.00.00, 4011.92.00.00,\n       4011.93.40.00, 4011.93.80.00, 4011.94.40.00, and 4011.94.80.00. While HTSUS\n       subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description\n       of the scope is dispositive.\n\n\n\n       2\n         Although the AD Order and CVD Order differ in some respects, the two orders are\nidentical for the purpose of defining the scope of the orders.\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                               Page 4\n\n\nAD Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 51,624\u201325 (footnotes with definitions omitted). The orders also listed\n\ntypes of tires which were excluded from the scope:\n\n        [P]neumatic tires that are not new, including recycled or retreaded tires and used tires;\n        non-pneumatic tires, including solid rubber tires; tires of a kind designed for use on\n        aircraft, all-terrain vehicles, and vehicles for turf, lawn and garden, golf and trailer\n        applications. Also excluded from the scope are radial and bias tires of a kind designed\n        for use in mining and construction vehicles and equipment that have a rim diameter equal\n        to or exceeding 39 inches. Such tires may be distinguished from other tires of similar\n        size by the number of plies that the construction and mining tires contain (minimum of\n        16) and the weight of such tires (minimum 1500 pounds).\n\nId. at 51,625. In February 2011, OTR Wheel filed a scope ruling request, asking that Commerce\n\nfind Trac Master and Traction Master tires imported by OTR Wheel fall within the scope\n\nexclusion for \u201ctires of a kind used on . . . vehicles for turf, lawn and garden . . . applications.\u201d\n\nScope Ruling Request: OTR Wheel Engineering, Inc. \u2013 Lawn & Garden Tires, available at Pl.\u2019s\n\nApp., Ex. A, at 4 (Feb. 11, 2011) (quoting AD Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 51,625). OTR Wheel\n\nargued that the plain language of the scope was dispositive in excluding OTR Wheel\u2019s Trac\n\nMaster and Traction Master tires. Id. Bridgestone Americas, Inc. and Bridgestone Americas\n\nTire Operations, LLC (collectively \u201cBridgestone\u201d) filed comments opposing OTR Wheel\u2019s\n\nexclusion request.\n\n                In April 2011, Commerce released its Final Scope Ruling, finding that the tires\n\nwere not excluded from the orders. Final Scope Ruling at 8. Pursuant to 19 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 351.225(k)(1), Commerce stated that it found the description of the merchandise contained in\n\nthe petition, the initial investigation, and the determinations of the Secretary of Commerce and\n\nthe ITC to be dispositive. Id. at 6. By drafting the scope orders during the original investigation\n\nto replace the word \u201cuse\u201d with the phrase \u201cdesigned for use,\u201d Commerce made clear that end-use\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                             Page 5\n\n\nwas not determinative. Id. Commerce then looked at data from the Tire and Rim Association\n\n(\u201cTRA\u201d) and the ITC\u2019s injury determinations to determine the general purpose of the tires.\n\nCommerce found that tires with R-1 and R-4 type treads were used for farming, light industrial\n\nservice, and highway mowing. Id. at 7. Because the tires in question had R-1 and R-4 type\n\ntreads, Commerce determined that such tires were not excluded from the scope of the order. Id.\n\nat 7\u20138. Commerce found it unnecessary to conduct a formal proceeding to consider the\n\nadditional factors contained in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(2). Id. at 5.3 For its part, OTR Wheel\n\ndoes not argue that its tires fall outside the general scope of the orders, merely that they are\n\nwithin an exclusion for turf, lawn, and garden applications.\n\n                      JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n               The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2).

Pl.\u2019s Rule 56.2 Mot. for J. on the\n\nAgency R. (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mot.\u201d) 11. Specifically, OTR Wheel argues that Commerce erred because it\n\ngave improper weight to tread type, failed to consider tire size, and took statements made in the\n\nITC injury determinations out of context.

Final\n\nScope Ruling at 7. All OTR Wheel tires at issue have R-1 and R-4 type treads.6 Commerce\n\nreviewed the \u201cTRA\u2019s 2011 Yearbook regarding agricultural and industrial tires, and lawn and\n\ngarden tires, and found no instance where the TRA designated R-1 and R-4 [tread type] tires for\n\nservice for lawn and garden applications.\u201d Id. After noting that the orders covered tires ranging\n\nfrom eight to fifty-four inches in rim diameter and that the tires at issue were from eight to\n\ntwelve inches in rim diameter, Commerce turned to the ITC\u2019s Preliminary Injury Determination\n\nPricing Data, which referenced Hi-Traction Lug R-1 tread type tires stating:\n\n       R-1 tires are identified as:\n               . . . a typical farm tractor rear wheel having a regular depth \u2018lug-type\u2019 R-1 tread\n               used for general farming, as defined by the Tire Rim Association \u2018TRA.\u2019 A farm\n               tractor tire of this nature would typically have a herringbone (criss-cross) tread\n\n\n       6\n         OTR Wheel\u2019s tires were classified under HTSUS 4011.61.0000: \u201cOther, having a\n\u2018herring-bone\u2019 or similar tread: Of a kind used on agricultural or forestry vehicles and\nmachines.\u201d This subheading is mentioned in the orders.

Tires of this\n              type are commonly found on the rear wheel of \u2018backhoe loaders\u2019 which, for\n              example, may be used in a stationary, braced position to dig holes and trenches\n              with the backhoe; for example, to tie into an underground water main or power\n              supply in light construction areas. The front blade attachment may be used to\n              scoop up and lift dirt. TRA recommends this type tire for light industrial service\n              and highway mowing.\n\nFinal Scope Ruling at 7 (quoting Preliminary Injury Determination at V-3). OTR Wheel states\n\nthat \u201cR-4 tires are traditionally, but not universally, designed for use on tractors, light industrial\n\nequipment or on vehicles with highway mowing capabilities,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. 3\u20134, 17, but Commerce\n\ndiscounted OTR Wheel\u2019s evidence that its products are advertised for use on lawn and garden\n\n\n\n       7\n         Commerce in the Final Scope Ruling claims that the Preliminary Injury Determination\nwas \u201cunchanged in final determination.\u201d Final Scope Ruling at 7 n.38.

Although the TRA 2011 Yearbook might support a conclusion that some tires\n\ncontaining R-1 and R-4 tread types have been designed for use on other than turf, lawn and\n\ngarden vehicles, the Yearbook also provides some evidence that tires of the size (and possibly\n\nthe tread type) created by OTR Wheel are designed for use on turf, lawn, and garden vehicles.\n\nTaken as a whole and without further context, the TRA 2011 Yearbook does not provide\n\nsubstantial support for a scope decision as to OTR Wheel\u2019s tires.\n\n               OTR Wheel contends that \u201cCommerce\u2019s reference to the ITC Final [Injury\n\nDetermination] is misleading because that particular ITC reference to tread types was taken\n\n\n\n\n       12\n         OTR Wheel alleges that all its tires fall within the tire size designations of this section.\nOTR Wheel\u2019s tires range from 16 inches (nominal overall diameter) by 7.50 inches (nominal\nsection width) to 26 inches by 12.00 inches.

Commerce counters that the ITC references are merely\n\ndescriptions of R-1 and R-4 tread type tires generally and that such definitions were not limited\n\nto certain R-1 and R-4 tread type tires included within the scope of the orders. Def.\u2019s Resp. at\n\n17.\n\n               Preliminarily, Commerce has not explained if the absence of the explanatory\n\nfootnotes regarding R-1 and R-4 tread type tires from the Final Injury Determination has any\n\nsignificance. Next, the Preliminary Injury Determination focuses on \u201cHi-Traction Lug R-1\u201d and\n\n\u201cIndustrial Tractor Lug R-4\u201d tires of certain sizes. Preliminary Injury Determination at V-3.\n\nThe referenced \u201cIndustrial Tractor Lug R-4\" size tire does not seem consistent with the\n\ndimensions of OTR Wheel\u2019s tires. That is, the descriptions of these tires seem applicable to tires\n\nof specific usage, size, and tread type, rather than generally fitting to all R-1 and R-4 tread type\n\ntires. Thus, the materials cited from ITC\u2019s injury investigation fail to provide useful evidence\n\nthat all R-1 and R-4 tread type tires of a size imported by OTR Wheel are not excluded from the\n\nscope of the orders by the turf, lawn, and garden exception.14\n\n\n       13\n          The ITC Final Injury Determination at V-4 lists some specific R-1 and R-4 tires,\nwithout definition. As noted by OTR Wheel, these lists are in the pricing section of the Final\nInjury Determination, as they were in the Preliminary. It is unclear what the ITC determinations\nadd to the inquiry.\n       14\n          Commerce argues that OTR Wheel \u201chas not provided information to substantiate that\nclaim [that OTR Wheel\u2019s Trac Master and Traction Master tires are specifically designed for use\non vehicles with turf, lawn, and garden applications] (e.g., designs, schematics, internal\nmemoranda, etc.).\u201d Final Scope Ruling at 8; see Def.\u2019s Resp. at 14.

Although evidence cited by Commerce may\n\nindicate that some tires containing R-1 and R-4 tread types are designed for general agricultural\n\nand industrial use, Commerce\u2019s evidence does not indicate that other R-1 and R-4 tread type tires\n\nare not designed more specifically for use on turf, lawn, and garden vehicles. Commerce\u2019s\n\ndetermination lacks substantial evidence that all tires with R-1 and R-4 tread types are included\n\nwithin the scope of the order. The sources used by Commerce under its purported (k)(1) analysis\n\nare not \u201c\u2018controlling\u2019 of the scope inquiry in the sense that they definitively answer the scope\n\nquestion.\u201d Sango Int\u2019l, 484 F.3d at 1379. The industry standards and ITC injury investigation\n\nmaterials relied upon by Commerce do not provide substantial support for determining whether\n\ntires of this particular size and tread type are excluded as turf, lawn, or garden tires.15 It seems\n\nquite unlikely that Commerce can confine itself to a limited \u00a7 351.225(k)(1) analysis here and\n\nreach a supported conclusion for the question of whether Plaintiff\u2019s products are designed for use\n\nin vehicles for turf, lawn, or garden applications.

Normally, Commerce\ncannot consider these types of materials under a (k)(1) analysis, no matter who submits them.\nThe issue here is whether a full inquiry should be undertaken.\n       15\n        As the documents Commerce relied on do not clarify scope, we need not analyze all the\ndocuments that Commerce may consider at the (k)(1) stage in order to determine if the materials\nCommerce did consider were somehow incorporated into permitted documents.\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                            Page 14\n\n\nThese seem to be the types of questions that require a more reaching (k)(2) analysis.

The foregoing list of vehicles\n       and equipment generally have in common that they are used for hauling, towing, lifting,\n       and/or loading a wide variety of equipment and materials in agricultural, construction and\n       industrial settings. Such vehicles and equipment, and the descriptions contained in the\n       footnotes are illustrative of the types of vehicles and equipment that use certain OTR\n       tires, but are not necessarily all-inclusive. While the physical characteristics of certain\n       OTR tires will vary depending on the specific applications and conditions for which the\n       tires are designed (e.g., tread pattern and depth), all of the tires within the scope have in\n       common that they are designed for off-road and off-highway use. Except as discussed\n       below, OTR tires included in the scope of the order range in size (rim diameter) generally\n       but not exclusively from 8 inches to 54 inches. The tires may be either tube-type or\n       tubeless, radial or non-radial, and intended for sale either to original equipment\n       manufacturers or the replacement market. The subject merchandise is currently\n       classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (\u201cHTSUS\u201d)\n       subheadings: 4011.20.10.25, 4011.20.10.35, 4011.20.50.30, 4011.20.50.50,\n       4011.61.00.00, 4011.62.00.00, 4011.63.00.00, 4011.69.00.00, 4011.92.00.00,\n       4011.93.40.00, 4011.93.80.00, 4011.94.40.00, and 4011.94.80.00. While HTSUS\n       subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description\n       of the scope is dispositive.\n\n\n\n       2\n         Although the AD Order and CVD Order differ in some respects, the two orders are\nidentical for the purpose of defining the scope of the orders.\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                               Page 4\n\n\nAD Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 51,624\u201325 (footnotes with definitions omitted). The orders also listed\n\ntypes of tires which were excluded from the scope:\n\n        [P]neumatic tires that are not new, including recycled or retreaded tires and used tires;\n        non-pneumatic tires, including solid rubber tires; tires of a kind designed for use on\n        aircraft, all-terrain vehicles, and vehicles for turf, lawn and garden, golf and trailer\n        applications. Also excluded from the scope are radial and bias tires of a kind designed\n        for use in mining and construction vehicles and equipment that have a rim diameter equal\n        to or exceeding 39 inches. Such tires may be distinguished from other tires of similar\n        size by the number of plies that the construction and mining tires contain (minimum of\n        16) and the weight of such tires (minimum 1500 pounds).\n\nId. at 51,625. In February 2011, OTR Wheel filed a scope ruling request, asking that Commerce\n\nfind Trac Master and Traction Master tires imported by OTR Wheel fall within the scope\n\nexclusion for \u201ctires of a kind used on . . . vehicles for turf, lawn and garden . . . applications.\u201d\n\nScope Ruling Request: OTR Wheel Engineering, Inc. \u2013 Lawn & Garden Tires, available at Pl.\u2019s\n\nApp., Ex. A, at 4 (Feb. 11, 2011) (quoting AD Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 51,625). OTR Wheel\n\nargued that the plain language of the scope was dispositive in excluding OTR Wheel\u2019s Trac\n\nMaster and Traction Master tires. Id. Bridgestone Americas, Inc. and Bridgestone Americas\n\nTire Operations, LLC (collectively \u201cBridgestone\u201d) filed comments opposing OTR Wheel\u2019s\n\nexclusion request.\n\n                In April 2011, Commerce released its Final Scope Ruling, finding that the tires\n\nwere not excluded from the orders. Final Scope Ruling at 8. Pursuant to 19 C.F.R.\n\n\u00a7 351.225(k)(1), Commerce stated that it found the description of the merchandise contained in\n\nthe petition, the initial investigation, and the determinations of the Secretary of Commerce and\n\nthe ITC to be dispositive. Id. at 6. By drafting the scope orders during the original investigation\n\nto replace the word \u201cuse\u201d with the phrase \u201cdesigned for use,\u201d Commerce made clear that end-use\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                             Page 5\n\n\nwas not determinative. Id. Commerce then looked at data from the Tire and Rim Association\n\n(\u201cTRA\u201d) and the ITC\u2019s injury determinations to determine the general purpose of the tires.\n\nCommerce found that tires with R-1 and R-4 type treads were used for farming, light industrial\n\nservice, and highway mowing. Id. at 7. Because the tires in question had R-1 and R-4 type\n\ntreads, Commerce determined that such tires were not excluded from the scope of the order. Id.\n\nat 7\u20138. Commerce found it unnecessary to conduct a formal proceeding to consider the\n\nadditional factors contained in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(2). Id. at 5.3 For its part, OTR Wheel\n\ndoes not argue that its tires fall outside the general scope of the orders, merely that they are\n\nwithin an exclusion for turf, lawn, and garden applications.\n\n                      JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n               The court has jurisdiction pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(a)(2). Commerce\u2019s final\n\nscope determination is upheld unless it is found \u201cto be unsupported by substantial evidence on\n\nthe record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n               In determining if a product is within the scope of an order, \u201c\u2018the scope of a final\n\norder may be clarified, [but] it can not be changed in a way contrary to its terms.\u2019\u201d Duferco\n\nSteel, Inc. v. United States, 296 F.3d 1087, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting Smith Corona Corp.\n\nv. United States, 915 F.2d 683, 686 (Fed.

Pl.\u2019s Rule 56.2 Mot. for J. on the\n\nAgency R. (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mot.\u201d) 11. Specifically, OTR Wheel argues that Commerce erred because it\n\ngave improper weight to tread type, failed to consider tire size, and took statements made in the\n\nITC injury determinations out of context. Id. at 11\u201314.\n\n                 Pursuant to 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(d),5 \u201cin considering whether a particular product\n\nis included within the scope of an order or a suspended investigation, [Commerce] will take into\n\naccount . . . [t]he descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition, the initial\n\n\n\n       4\n         The Government contends that although the plain scope language itself is not\ndispositive, when understood in the context of the controlling documents it becomes clear that\nthe merchandise is not excluded.\n       5\n           Section 351.225(d) states that:\n\n       If the Secretary can determine, based solely upon the application and the descriptions of\n       the merchandise referred to in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, whether a product is\n       included within the scope of an order or a suspended investigation, the Secretary will\n       issue a final ruling as to whether the product is included within the order or suspended\n       investigation.\n\n19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(d).\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                               Page 7\n\n\ninvestigation, and the determinations of [Commerce] (including prior scope determinations) and\n\nthe [ITC].\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(1). Only \u201c[w]hen the above criteria are not dispositive . . .\n\nwill [Commerce] further consider: (i) The physical characteristics of the product; (ii) The\n\nexpectations of the ultimate purchasers; (iii) The ultimate use of the product; (iv) The channels\n\nof trade in which the product is sold; and (v) The manner in which the product is advertised and\n\ndisplayed.\u201d 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(2).\n\n               In its Final Scope Ruling, Commerce determined that the record evidence\n\ndemonstrated that OTR Wheel\u2019s Trac Master and Traction Master tires were not specifically\n\ndesigned for turf, lawn, and garden applications because of the tread types of the tires. Final\n\nScope Ruling at 7. All OTR Wheel tires at issue have R-1 and R-4 type treads.6 Commerce\n\nreviewed the \u201cTRA\u2019s 2011 Yearbook regarding agricultural and industrial tires, and lawn and\n\ngarden tires, and found no instance where the TRA designated R-1 and R-4 [tread type] tires for\n\nservice for lawn and garden applications.\u201d Id. After noting that the orders covered tires ranging\n\nfrom eight to fifty-four inches in rim diameter and that the tires at issue were from eight to\n\ntwelve inches in rim diameter, Commerce turned to the ITC\u2019s Preliminary Injury Determination\n\nPricing Data, which referenced Hi-Traction Lug R-1 tread type tires stating:\n\n       R-1 tires are identified as:\n               . . . a typical farm tractor rear wheel having a regular depth \u2018lug-type\u2019 R-1 tread\n               used for general farming, as defined by the Tire Rim Association \u2018TRA.\u2019 A farm\n               tractor tire of this nature would typically have a herringbone (criss-cross) tread\n\n\n       6\n         OTR Wheel\u2019s tires were classified under HTSUS 4011.61.0000: \u201cOther, having a\n\u2018herring-bone\u2019 or similar tread: Of a kind used on agricultural or forestry vehicles and\nmachines.\u201d This subheading is mentioned in the orders.

Tires of this\n              type are commonly found on the rear wheel of \u2018backhoe loaders\u2019 which, for\n              example, may be used in a stationary, braced position to dig holes and trenches\n              with the backhoe; for example, to tie into an underground water main or power\n              supply in light construction areas. The front blade attachment may be used to\n              scoop up and lift dirt. TRA recommends this type tire for light industrial service\n              and highway mowing.\n\nFinal Scope Ruling at 7 (quoting Preliminary Injury Determination at V-3). OTR Wheel states\n\nthat \u201cR-4 tires are traditionally, but not universally, designed for use on tractors, light industrial\n\nequipment or on vehicles with highway mowing capabilities,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. 3\u20134, 17, but Commerce\n\ndiscounted OTR Wheel\u2019s evidence that its products are advertised for use on lawn and garden\n\n\n\n       7\n         Commerce in the Final Scope Ruling claims that the Preliminary Injury Determination\nwas \u201cunchanged in final determination.\u201d Final Scope Ruling at 7 n.38. This is incorrect.\nAlthough the Final Injury Determination references some of the same types of tires, the Final\nInjury Determination does not contain the two footnotes explaining the use of the R-1 and R-4\ntread type tires referenced there, upon which Commerce relied in its Final Scope Ruling.

Ultimate use is to be considered under 19 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 351.225(k)(2). End-use, however, is not dispositive unless scope is clearly limited by end-use.\nKing Supply Co., 674 F.3d at 1348\u201349 (finding that when Commerce intends to impose an\nend-use exception it uses the terms \u201conly\u201d or \u201csolely\u201d).\n       9\n        Additionally, no party contends that the petition contains information defining the\nexclusion clause in the order. The court notes that 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(1) requires\nCommerce to consider the petition. Here, Commerce made no reference to the petition in its\nFinal Scope Ruling, except for a formulaic mention of it.\n       10\n          The court also notes that in a limited inquiry under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(1)\nCommerce may not rely on Bridgestone\u2019s ex-petition comments regarding usage of R-1 and R-4\ntread type tires.

United States, Slip Op. 11-82, 2011 WL 2713872, at *1 (CIT July 12, 2011) (finding that\n\n\u201c4.75 mm\u201d is not one definite measurement because, in the context of the industry, purchasers\n\nroutinely accept variance in measurement).11 Because the exclusionary provision of the orders\n\ndoes not unambiguously define \u201ctires of a kind designed for use on . . . vehicles for turf, lawn\n\nand garden . . . applications,\u201d AD Order, 73 Fed. Reg. at 51,625, Commerce relied on external\n\ndocuments to try to determine if OTR Wheel products were excluded, but it did not limit itself to\n\nthe documents listed in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(1). Neither did Commerce formally reach the 19\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(2) factors. In any case, the documents Commerce cited do not provide\n\nsubstantial evidence for its scope determination.\n\n               Both parties rely on the TRA 2011 Yearbook, yet it is unclear what it says about\n\nindustry understanding of the tires at issue. OTR Wheel identifies evidence in the TRA 2011\n\nYearbook as an indication that \u201cTrac Master and Traction Master tires are tires of a kind\n\ndesigned for use on vehicles with turf, lawn and garden applications.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 11 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). OTR Wheel alleges that its tires fall within the size of \u201cLawn and\n\nGarden\u201d tires in TRA 2011 Yearbook Section 6 (\u201cIndustrial Section\u201d) and are smaller than some\n\nof the tires in TRA 2011 Yearbook Section 5 (\u201cAgricultural Section\u201d). Id. at 11 (citing Pl.\u2019s\n\nApp. Ex. E at 6-24\u20136-31). OTR Wheel contends that Commerce \u201cinexplicably disregarded or\n\nignored\u201d this evidence, and \u201caccord[ed] disproportionate weight to the fact that Plaintiff\u2019s tires\n\nhappen to share a common \u2018R-1\u2019and \u2018R-4\u2019 tread type with some of the tires covered by the\u201d\n\n\n       11\n          The Government relies on this case to expand its ability to look beyond (k)(1) criteria\nor to avoid formal proceedings, but it is one thing to look at accepted industry understandings of\nparticular terms used in an order. It is another matter to look at industry publications to\ndetermine if particular products fit within undefined terms.\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                            Page 11\n\n\norders. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 11, 13, 16\u201318. The Industrial Section of the TRA 2011 Yearbook contains\n\na sub-section defining \u201cTires for Utility Vehicles and Lawn and Garden Tractors.\u201d All of OTR\n\nWheel\u2019s tires fall within the tire size designations of this section,12 but the sub-section does not\n\nspecify whether tires under this section contain either an R-1 or R-4 type tread. Pl.\u2019s App. Ex. E,\n\nat 6-24\u201327.\n\n               The Agricultural Section of the TRA 2011 Yearbook does not contain a sub-\n\nsection on lawn and garden tires and, unlike the Industrial Section, which does not address tire\n\ntread type, lists R-1 or R-4 tread type tires as for service on \u201cagricultural tractor[s],\u201d combine\n\nharvester[s],\u201d \u201cagricultural high clearance sprayer[s],\u201d and \u201cindustrial tractor[s].\u201d Pl.\u2019s App. Ex.\n\nE, at 5-01. Although the TRA 2011 Yearbook might support a conclusion that some tires\n\ncontaining R-1 and R-4 tread types have been designed for use on other than turf, lawn and\n\ngarden vehicles, the Yearbook also provides some evidence that tires of the size (and possibly\n\nthe tread type) created by OTR Wheel are designed for use on turf, lawn, and garden vehicles.\n\nTaken as a whole and without further context, the TRA 2011 Yearbook does not provide\n\nsubstantial support for a scope decision as to OTR Wheel\u2019s tires.\n\n               OTR Wheel contends that \u201cCommerce\u2019s reference to the ITC Final [Injury\n\nDetermination] is misleading because that particular ITC reference to tread types was taken\n\n\n\n\n       12\n         OTR Wheel alleges that all its tires fall within the tire size designations of this section.\nOTR Wheel\u2019s tires range from 16 inches (nominal overall diameter) by 7.50 inches (nominal\nsection width) to 26 inches by 12.00 inches. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 11. Tires under the \u201cUtility Vehicles\nand Lawn and Garden Tractors\u201d sub-section range from 11 inches by 4.00 inches to 27 inches by\n12 inches. Pl.\u2019s App. Ex. E, at 6-24\u201331. Thus, OTR Wheel\u2019s tires all fall within the tire size\ndesignations of the \u201cTires for Utility Vehicles and Lawn and Garden Tractors\u201d section.\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                           Page 12\n\n\nentirely out of context.\u201d13 Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 14. OTR Wheel asserts that the ITC\u2019s discussion focused\n\non the pricing of in-scope product categories to the exclusion of product categories excluded\n\nfrom the scope. Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 14\u201315. Commerce counters that the ITC references are merely\n\ndescriptions of R-1 and R-4 tread type tires generally and that such definitions were not limited\n\nto certain R-1 and R-4 tread type tires included within the scope of the orders. Def.\u2019s Resp. at\n\n17.\n\n               Preliminarily, Commerce has not explained if the absence of the explanatory\n\nfootnotes regarding R-1 and R-4 tread type tires from the Final Injury Determination has any\n\nsignificance. Next, the Preliminary Injury Determination focuses on \u201cHi-Traction Lug R-1\u201d and\n\n\u201cIndustrial Tractor Lug R-4\u201d tires of certain sizes. Preliminary Injury Determination at V-3.\n\nThe referenced \u201cIndustrial Tractor Lug R-4\" size tire does not seem consistent with the\n\ndimensions of OTR Wheel\u2019s tires. That is, the descriptions of these tires seem applicable to tires\n\nof specific usage, size, and tread type, rather than generally fitting to all R-1 and R-4 tread type\n\ntires. Thus, the materials cited from ITC\u2019s injury investigation fail to provide useful evidence\n\nthat all R-1 and R-4 tread type tires of a size imported by OTR Wheel are not excluded from the\n\nscope of the orders by the turf, lawn, and garden exception.14\n\n\n       13\n          The ITC Final Injury Determination at V-4 lists some specific R-1 and R-4 tires,\nwithout definition. As noted by OTR Wheel, these lists are in the pricing section of the Final\nInjury Determination, as they were in the Preliminary. It is unclear what the ITC determinations\nadd to the inquiry.\n       14\n          Commerce argues that OTR Wheel \u201chas not provided information to substantiate that\nclaim [that OTR Wheel\u2019s Trac Master and Traction Master tires are specifically designed for use\non vehicles with turf, lawn, and garden applications] (e.g., designs, schematics, internal\nmemoranda, etc.).\u201d Final Scope Ruling at 8; see Def.\u2019s Resp. at 14. Such documents are\n                                                                                      (continued...)\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                            Page 13\n\n\n               It is not enough that OTR Wheel\u2019s tires are agricultural or industrial tires\n\ngenerally within the scope of the order: OTR Wheel\u2019s tires must not be designed for use on turf,\n\nlawn, and garden vehicles in order to be included. Although evidence cited by Commerce may\n\nindicate that some tires containing R-1 and R-4 tread types are designed for general agricultural\n\nand industrial use, Commerce\u2019s evidence does not indicate that other R-1 and R-4 tread type tires\n\nare not designed more specifically for use on turf, lawn, and garden vehicles. Commerce\u2019s\n\ndetermination lacks substantial evidence that all tires with R-1 and R-4 tread types are included\n\nwithin the scope of the order. The sources used by Commerce under its purported (k)(1) analysis\n\nare not \u201c\u2018controlling\u2019 of the scope inquiry in the sense that they definitively answer the scope\n\nquestion.\u201d Sango Int\u2019l, 484 F.3d at 1379. The industry standards and ITC injury investigation\n\nmaterials relied upon by Commerce do not provide substantial support for determining whether\n\ntires of this particular size and tread type are excluded as turf, lawn, or garden tires.15 It seems\n\nquite unlikely that Commerce can confine itself to a limited \u00a7 351.225(k)(1) analysis here and\n\nreach a supported conclusion for the question of whether Plaintiff\u2019s products are designed for use\n\nin vehicles for turf, lawn, or garden applications. What are turf, lawn, and garden applications?\n\nHow does the industry view tires that are relatively small, but have somewhat aggressive treads?\n\n\n\n\n       14\n         (...continued)\ntypically evidence of the physical characteristics of the product, which are considered by\nCommerce as part of its formal 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k)(2) analysis. Normally, Commerce\ncannot consider these types of materials under a (k)(1) analysis, no matter who submits them.\nThe issue here is whether a full inquiry should be undertaken.\n       15\n        As the documents Commerce relied on do not clarify scope, we need not analyze all the\ndocuments that Commerce may consider at the (k)(1) stage in order to determine if the materials\nCommerce did consider were somehow incorporated into permitted documents.\n\fCourt No. 11-00166                                                                            Page 14\n\n\nThese seem to be the types of questions that require a more reaching (k)(2) analysis. Thus,\n\nunless there is some dispositive feature of the petition and prior determinations that were\n\noverlooked by Commerce, it shall proceed with a full inquiry.16\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               Although OTR Wheel has asked this court to \u201cremand this matter to Commerce\n\nwith instructions to exclude Plaintiff\u2019s \u2018Trac Master\u2019 and \u2018Traction Master\u2019 tires from the scope\n\nof the subject Tires Orders,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. 24, Commerce has not yet properly completed its\n\nanalysis under 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k). The court hereby remands the matter to Commerce for\n\nfurther evaluation pursuant to the procedures set forth in 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225(k).\n\n\n\n                                                          /s/ Jane A. Restani\n                                                             Jane A. Restani\n                                                                 Judge\n\nDated: This 27th day of June, 2012.\n       New York, New York.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          The Government contends that OTR Wheel has not exhausted its administrative\nremedies as to \u00a7 351.225(k)(2) because it initially contended that either the plain scope language\nor the \u00a7 351.225(k)(1) materials were dispositive of the issue in its favor. If Commerce\u2019s\nconclusion, which is properly before this court, is not supported by substantial evidence, the\nGovernment may not prevail. That OTR Wheel properly challenged Commerce\u2019s\n\u00a7 351.225(k)(1) analysis is sufficient. If Commerce cannot make a proper (k)(1) decision, it\nmust proceed with a (k)(2) analysis and permit the parties to submit the full range of evidence.\nWhat it may not do is reject (k)(2) evidence from one party and accept it from another.\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "12-89", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "de2eff460b4a620bdd8027c2019c729b8f66203a", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "United States Court of International Trade", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/210656/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/212077/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/548804/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/626137/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/778388/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2013-02-10T19:36:19.624578Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 14, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/820120/otr-wheel-engineering-inc-v-united-states/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "820120", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "OTR Wheel Engineering, Inc. v.
