We affirm.\n\f                                   BACKGROUND\n\n      Jules sued Marvlyn for divorce, and Marvlyn countersued.

Temporary orders\n\n      Jules contends that the trial court\u2019s temporary orders improperly excluded him\n\nfrom his home, removed the children from his care, and deprived him of access to\n\nthe children. These orders continued in force until the trial court entered the divorce\n\ndecree.\n\n      This court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments, not\n\ninterlocutory orders, unless interlocutory appeal is authorized by statute.

Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review challenges to the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s temporary orders, and thus overrule Jules\u2019s first, third, and eighth issues.\n\nII.   Lack of a reporter\u2019s record\n\n      The appellate record was due on January 30, 2017. Jules failed to pay or make\n\nsatisfactory arrangements to pay for the record. The clerk of the court notified Jules,\n\nwho is not appealing as an indigent, that unless he filed proof of payment or\n\nsatisfactory arrangement of payment by March 3, the court could consider and\n\ndecide any issues for which a reporter\u2019s record was unnecessary. After Jules failed\n\nto satisfy this deadline, the court notified him that it would decide those issues and\n\nordered the parties to file their briefs. To date, a reporter\u2019s record has not been filed\n\n\n                                           3\n\fand Jules has filed neither proof of payment nor proof of satisfactory arrangement\n\nof payment for it.\n\n      The remainder of Jules\u2019s challenges turn on the evidence introduced at trial or\n\nrulings made by the trial court. Jules contends that he did not waive trial by jury;\n\nMarvlyn responds that he did. Jules contends that Marvlyn\u2019s counsel tampered with\n\na witness by excusing that witness before the witness had testified and that the trial\n\ncourt failed to provide him with adequate relief from this misconduct; Marvlyn\n\ndisputes Jules\u2019s account. Jules contends that the trial court violated his free-speech\n\nrights by considering statements Jules made on the internet, but there is nothing in\n\nthe record that demonstrates the substance of these statements and the trial court\u2019s\n\nconsideration of them at trial. Jules contends that the evidence is insufficient to\n\nsupport multiple aspects of the divorce decree; however, neither the witness\n\ntestimony nor the trial exhibits are before us. Finally, Jules contends that the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s fee award was improper, but the record does not contain any of the\n\nproceedings concerning attorney\u2019s fees.\n\n      When the merits of an appellate issue depend on the evidence introduced at\n\ntrial or the rulings made by the trial court, a reporter\u2019s record of the relevant proof\n\nor challenged ruling is necessary; without the reporter\u2019s record, the appellate court\n\ncannot ascertain whether there was reversible error.
