Galligan drove past the van, confirmed the description of the suspect\r\nand the suspect\u2019s van with a police dispatcher, and then advised the dispatcher that\r\nhe had possibly located the suspect.  Galligan then drove back toward the van and\r\nsaw that the appellant had walked out into the street.  When appellant pulled a gun\r\nfrom under his shirt, ran toward Galligan, and fired his gun, Galligan got out of his\r\npolice car and returned gun fire.  Appellant then returned to his van, reloaded his\r\nweapon, and again ran toward Galligan, firing his gun</span><span>.  Galligan reloaded his gun and\r\npointed it at appellant, who then surrendered.  However, appellant struggled with\r\nGalligan as he attempted to handcuff him.
