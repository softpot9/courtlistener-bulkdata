Because substantial evidence\nsupports the Board's decision, we affirm.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (Act) authorizes the Attorney\nGeneral, in her discretion, to confer asylum on any refugee. See 8\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (1994). The Act defines a refugee as a person\nunwilling or unable to return to his native country\"because of perse-\ncution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, reli-\ngion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\nopinion.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (1994); see M.A. v. INS, 899\nF.2d 304, 307 (4th Cir. 1990) (in banc).\n\nThe \"well-founded fear of persecution\" standard contains both a\nsubjective and an objective component. An applicant may satisfy the\nsubjective element by presenting \"`candid, credible, and sincere testi-\nmony' demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.\" Berroteran-\nMelendez v. INS, 955 F.2d 1251, 1256 (9th Cir. 1992); see Figeroa\nv. INS, 886 F.2d 76, 79 (4th Cir. 1989). The objective element\nrequires a showing of specific, concrete facts that would lead a rea-\nsonable person in like circumstances to fear persecution. See\nHuaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, 979 F.2d 995,\n999 (4th Cir. 1992).\n\nEligibility for asylum can also be based on grounds of past perse-\ncution alone even though there is \"`no reasonable likelihood of pres-\nent persecution.'\" Baka v. INS, 963 F.2d 1376, 1379 (10th Cir. 1992)\n(quoting Rivera-Cruz v. INS, 948 F.2d 962, 969 (5th Cir. 1991)). \"To\nestablish such eligibility, an alien must show past persecution so\nsevere that repatriation would be inhumane.\" Id.; see Matter of Chen,\n20 I. & N. Dec. 16 (BIA 1989).\n\n                    2\n\fWe must uphold the Board's determination that Opoku-Arhin is\nnot eligible for asylum if the determination is\"supported by reason-\nable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as\na whole.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994).* We accord the Board all\npossible deference. See Huaman-Cornelio, 979 F.2d at 999. The deci-\nsion may be \"reversed only if the evidence presented by [Opoku-\nArhin] was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude\nthat the requisite fear of persecution existed.\" INS v. Elias-Zacarias,\n502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992).\n\nOpoku-Arhin, who entered the United States as an alien crewman\non March 19, 1992, disagrees with the Board's finding that he failed\nto qualify for asylum and withholding of deportation. Evidence estab-\nlished that Opoku-Arhin, a native and citizen of Ghana, worked as a\nnavigator in the Ghanian merchant marine from 1980 to 1992. In\n1986 he became active in the Campaign for Democracy in Ghana\n(CDG), a group opposed to the military dictatorship of Flight Lieuten-\nant Jerry Rawlings. Although not a high-ranking member of CDG,\nOpoku-Arhin attended meetings, distributed leaflets, and contributed\nfinancially to the group. On board his merchant marine ship, Opoku-\nArhin periodically organized CDG meetings of approximately twenty\npeople. Opoku-Arhin testified that he began to fear persecution for\nthese activities upon learning that a fellow shipmate was denounced\nby other shipmates for political activity. The shipmate fled Ghana in\n1994 amidst rumors he was wanted for questioning.\n\nOpoku-Arhin also testified that his sister told him that a neighbor\nwho was involved in the democracy movement was arrested and\nbeaten in 1994 for participation in political activities. Again according\nto the sister, the neighbor left the country after his 1994 release from\nincarceration. Opoku-Arhin further explained that he feared persecu-\ntion because his wife, whom he married in a customary ceremony in\nGhana in 1984, was the organizing secretary for a local branch of the\n_________________________________________________________________\n*We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994) was repealed by the Ille-\ngal Immigration Reform Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-\n128, 110 Stat. 3009 (IIRIRA), effective April 1, 1997. Because this case\nwas in transition at the time IIRIRA was passed, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)(a)(4)\nis still applicable under the terms of the transitional rules contained in\n\u00a7 309(c) of IIRIRA.\n\n                    3\n\fPopular Front Party (PFP), a group which advocated the overthrow of\nthe Rawlings government. His wife testified that she was arrested in\n1985 for participation in a demonstration. She was interrogated,\nbeaten, and forced to sign a statement that she would not participate\nin any political opposition upon her release. After her release, she fled\nto the United States. Opoku-Arhin's wife explained that the Ghanian\ngovernment never knew she and Opoku-Arhin were married because\nthey did not live together as husband and wife until they were\nreunited in the United States in 1992. Opoku-Arhin testified he fears\nthat someone in the Ghanian community in the United States who\nknows of their marriage may have informed the Ghanian government\nof the relationship.\n\nCiting the above evidence, Opoku-Arhin maintains that the Board\nand IJ erred in finding that he failed to demonstrate a well-founded\nfear of persecution. As a threshold matter, our review is limited to the\ndecision of the Board, not that of the IJ. See Huaman-Cornelio, 979\nF.2d at 999. We find that substantial evidence supports the Board's\nconclusion that Opoku-Arhin lacked an objective basis to fear perse-\ncution in Ghana because of his political opinion.\n\nAs the Board noted, Opoku-Arhin was never arrested, detained,\ninterrogated, or otherwise harmed for his political activities. More-\nover, while his wife testified to abuse because of her political opinion,\ntestimony established that the Ghanian government did not know that\nshe and Opoku-Arhin were married. Opoku-Arhin's professed fear\nthat Ghanians in the United States may have reported the marriage to\nthe Ghanian government is speculative. The State Department country\nreport in the record notes that the Rawlings regime is now engaged\nin a dialogue with opposition groups and that there are currently no\nknown political prisoners in Ghana. Because of these changes in\ncountry conditions, it is unlikely Opoku-Arhin would face persecution\nbecause of his relationship with an individual who has been living\nabroad for more than twelve years.\n\nSimilarly, Opoku-Arhin's expressed fear of mistreatment because\nof activities he engaged in before his departure more than five years\nago lacks an objective basis. And finally, Opoku-Arhin's claim that\nhe is similarly-situated to his fellow shipman and his neighbor, who\nboth experienced difficulties in 1994, is not persuasive because of the\n\n                     4\n\fchange in conditions which makes it clear that he is not in danger of\npersecution because of mere opposition to the government.\n\nOpoku-Arhin next contends that the IJ violated his right to Due\nProcess because he failed to consider all the evidence in the record\nand did not provide him with a fair and reasonable hearing. This\nclaim is meritless because the record shows that the IJ thoroughly\nconsidered all of the evidence presented and conducted an appropriate\nand adequate hearing. Opoku-Arhin further maintains that Board and\nIJ erred in failing to sufficiently consider the past persecution of his\nwife and those similarly situated, contending that he merited a grant\nof humanitarian asylum. Because there is no evidence in the record\nthat Opoku-Arhin personally suffered past persecution, we find this\ncontention to be without merit.\n\nFinally, Opoku-Arhin insists he qualified for withholding of depor-\ntation. The standard for withholding of deportation is more stringent\nthan that for granting asylum. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S.\n421, 431-32 (1987). To qualify for withholding of deportation, an\napplicant must demonstrate a \"clear probability of persecution.\" Id. at\n430. Because substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that\nOpoku-Arhin is ineligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher stan-\ndard for withholding of deportation.\n\nWe accordingly affirm the Board's order. We dispense with oral\nargument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately pres-\nented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the\ndecisional process.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n                    5\n\f", "ML_Tags": [], "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "Case_No": "97-2390", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">UNPUBLISHED\n\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n\nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\nJOSEPH OPOKU-ARHIN,\nPetitioner,\n\nv.\n                                                                       No. 97-2390\nU.S. IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION\nSERVICE,\nRespondent.\n\nOn Petition for Review of an Order\nof the Board of Immigration Appeals.\n(A72-382-677)\n\nSubmitted: April 14, 1998\n\nDecided: April 30, 1998\n\nBefore LUTTIG and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges, and HALL,\nSenior Circuit Judge.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nAffirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nCOUNSEL\n\nLaurence F.
