Salazar, et al., Case No. 11-cv-01564 (\u201cSCI Action\u201d), ECF\n\nNo. 26, and the other filed by the plaintiffs in Exotic Wildlife Association, et al. v. United States\n\n\n                                                    1\n\fDepartment of the Interior, et al., Case No. 12-cv-00340, ECF No. 3 (\u201cEWA Action\u201d). 1 The\n\nplaintiffs seek different injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiff in the SCI Action seeks to enjoin\n\nenforcement of endangered species status for U.S. non-native captive populations of three antelope\n\nspecies \u2013 the scimitar-horned oryx, dama gazelle, and addax (\u201cThree Antelope species\u201d), while the\n\nplaintiffs in the EWA Action are seeking more narrow relief to enjoin enforcement of a Final Rule\n\npromulgated by the Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d) that goes into effect on April 4, 2012\n\n(\u201cFinal Rule\u201d). The Final Rule would remove a regulation that has, since 2005, exempted U.S. non-\n\nnative captive populations of the Three Antelope species from many of the prohibitions, restrictions,\n\nand requirements attendant to their classification as endangered species. Since the exemption\n\nregulation was issued at the same time the Three Antelope species were listed as endangered in\n\n2005, the removal of the 2005 exemption would, for the first time, allow for full enforcement of\n\nendangered species status of the Three Antelope species. For the reasons explained below, the two\n\npending Motions for a Preliminary Injunction are denied. 2\n\nI.       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n         A.       Endangered Species Act, Fish and Wildlife Service, and The National\n                  Environmental Policy Act\n\n         The Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) was enacted by Congress in 1973 \u201cto provide a means\n\n\n1\n  It is helpful to understand the procedural background of this case before delving into the pending motions. The SCI\nand EWA Actions have been consolidated, along with Owen, et al. v. United States Department of the Interior, et al.,\nCase No. 12-cv-00194 (\u201cOwen Action\u201d). The Owen and EWA Actions were reassigned as related cases to the presiding\njudge on February 10 and March 14, 2012, respectively. Each of the three consolidated actions is against Ken Salazar,\nin his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d);\nand Daniel Ashe, in his official capacity as Director of the FWS. The U.S. Department of the Interior is also a\ndefendant in Case Nos. 12-cv-00194 and 12-cv-00340. (The Court refers to the defendants collectively as \u201cFederal\nDefendants\u201d). On March 23, 2012, this Court granted the Motions to Intervene by two organizations, Friends of\nAnimals (\u201cFOA\u201d) and Defenders of Wildlife (\u201cDOW\u201d) (collectively, \u201cdefendant-intervenors\u201d). See Order, Case No.\n11-cv-01564, ECF No. 42.\n2\n  The plaintiffs have requested a hearing on their motions for injunctive relief. See Letter from SCI counsel, dated\nMarch 23, 2012, ECF No. 44-5; EWA Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\u201cEWA Reply\u201d), ECF No. 40 at 20. The\nCourt finds, however, that \u201cthe record is sufficient to demonstrate a lack of right to relief\u201d without the need for a\nhearing. Smith v. Harvey, No. 06-1117 (RWR), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48150, at *5 (D.D.C. July 17, 2006) (citing\nJohnson v. Holway, 329 F. Supp. 2d 12, 14 n.1 (D.D.C. 2004)); Local Civil Rule 65.1(d) (noting \u201cpractice in this\njurisdiction\u201d to decide a motion for preliminary injunction on the papers).\n                                                            2\n\fwhereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be\n\nconserved, to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened\n\nspecies, and to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and\n\nconventions set forth in subsection(a) of this section.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b).\n\n           Under the Endangered Species Act, the Secretary 3 \u201cshall . . . determine whether any species\n\nis an endangered species or a threatened species because of any of the following factors:\u201d\n\n           (A) the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat\n           or range;\n           (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;\n           (C) disease or predation;\n           (D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or\n           (E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.\n\n16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(a). The Secretary makes this determination \u201csolely on the basis of the best\n\nscientific and commercial data available to him after conducting a review of the status of the species\n\nand after taking into account those efforts, if any, being made by any State or foreign nation, or any\n\npolitical subdivision of a State or foreign nation, to protect such species, whether by predator\n\ncontrol, protection of habitat and food supply, or other conservation practices, within any area under\n\nits jurisdiction, or on the high seas.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(b)(1)(A).\n\n           Once an animal species has been listed as \u201cendangered,\u201d it is unlawful under the ESA \u201cfor\n\nany person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d to, inter alia, \u201ctake any such species\n\nwithin the United States or the territorial sea of the United States\u201d or \u201csell or offer for sale in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce any such species\u201d or \u201cdeliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in\n\ninterstate or foreign commerce, by any means whatsoever and in the course of a commercial\n\nactivity, any such species.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1538(a)(1). To \u201ctake\u201d under the ESA means \u201cto harass,\n\nharm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such\n\nconduct.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532(19).\n\n3\n    The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for classifying the Three Antelope species as threatened or endangered.\n                                                              3\n\f       The ESA does, however, allow some \u201ctaking\u201d of endangered species through its permitting\n\nprograms. In 1979, the FWS established, pursuant to ESA section 10 authority, \u201ca permit program\n\nfor enhancement of propagation or survival of captive-bred wildlife (\u201cCBW Regulation\u201d).\u201d See\n\nFed. Defs.\u2019 Mem. in Opp. to SCI Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\u201cSCI Opp. Mem.\u201d) at 4. The CBW\n\nregulation provides that \u201cany person may take; export or re-import; deliver, receive, carry, transport\n\nor ship in interstate or foreign commerce, in the course of a commercial activity; or sell or offer for\n\nsale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered wildlife that is bred in captivity in the United\n\nStates provided . . . that\u201d a number of conditions are met, including that the \u201cpurpose of such\n\nactivity is to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.21(g)(1).\n\nThe FWS has also set forth regulations for application for individual permits authorizing \u201ctake\u201d that\n\n\u201cis incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity,\u201d see 16\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1539(a)(1)(B), or \u201cfor scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or survival of the\n\naffected species,\u201d see 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1539(a)(1)(A).\n\n       The National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) is a statute that, inter alia, requires\n\npreparation of an environmental impact statement in \u201cevery recommendation or report on proposals\n\nfor legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human\n\nenvironment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C).\n\n       B.      Three Antelope Species\n\n       This case concerns three antelope species, the scimitar-horned oryx, dama gazelle, and\n\naddax (\u201cThree Antelope species\u201d) living on private ranches in the United States. The Three\n\nAntelope species are native to the African continent. See 70 Fed. Reg. 52,310 (Sept. 2, 2005). The\n\nthree animal species at the center of this dispute are briefly described below:\n\n       The scimitar-horned oryx stands about 47 inches [in, 119 centimeters (cm)] tall and\n       weighs around 450 pounds [lb, 204 kilograms (kg)]. It is generally pale in color, but\n       the neck and chest are dark reddish brown. As the name suggests, adult animals\n       possess a pair of horns curving back in an arc up to 50 in (127 cm) long. The\n                                                    4\n\f       scimitar-horned oryx once had an extensive range in North Africa throughout the\n       semi-deserts and steppes north of the Sahara, from Morocco to Egypt.\n\n       The addax stands about 42 in (106 cm) tall at the shoulder and weighs around 220 lb\n       (100 kg). It is grayish white and its horns twist in a spiral up to 43 in (109 cm) long.\n       The addax once occurred throughout the deserts and sub-deserts of North Africa,\n       from the Atlantic Ocean to the Nile River.\n\n       The dama gazelle stands about 39 in (99 cm) tall at the shoulder and weighs around\n       160 lb (72 kg). The upper part of its body is mostly reddish brown, whereas the head,\n       rump, and underparts are white. Its horns curve back and up, but reach a length of\n       only about 17 in (43 cm) long. The dama gazelle, the largest of the gazelles, was\n       once common and widespread in arid and semi-arid regions of the Sahara.\n\n70 Fed. Reg. 52,319 (Sept. 2, 2005). Wild populations of the addax and dama gazelle still exist in\n\nAfrica, while the scimitar-horned oryx is thought to have disappeared from the wild. See SCI Mem.\n\nin Support of Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. (\u201cSCI Mem.\u201d) at 2.\n\n       Captive populations of the Three Antelope species exist in the United States and other parts\n\nof the world, including on the ranches of some of the plaintiffs in this consolidated case. SCI\n\nargues that \u201ccaptive populations are growing and thriving\u201d in the United States, see SCI Mem. at 4,\n\nor were until announcement of the Final Rule going into effect on April 4, 2012. The EWA\n\nplaintiffs argue, too, that the Three Antelope species have \u201cthrived\u201d thanks to \u201ca few foresighted\n\nlivestock ranchers\u201d who decided to collect and breed the Three Antelope species. EWA Mem. in\n\nSupport of Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. (\u201cEWA Mem.\u201d) at 6. \u201c[P]opulations of Texas-raised scimitar-\n\nhorned oryx exploded from 32 in 1979 to 11,032 in 2010; addax from 2 specimens in 1971 to 5,112\n\nin 2010; and dama gazelle from 9 individuals in 1979 to 894 in 2010.\u201d Id.\n\n       In promulgating the exemption of the Three Antelope species from certain prohibitions, on\n\nSeptember 2, 2005, the FWS acknowledged that the captive breeding has been helpful for the\n\nsurvival of the Three Antelope species:\n\n       Captive breeding in the United States has enhanced the propagation or survival of the\n       scimitar-horned oryx, addax, and dama gazelle worldwide by rescuing these species\n       from near extinction and providing the founder stock necessary for reintroduction.\n       The scimitar-horned oryx is possibly extinct in the wild; therefore, but for captive\n                                                  5\n\f       breeding, the species might be extinct. Addax and dama gazelle occur in very low\n       numbers in the wild, and a significant percentage of remaining specimens survive\n       only in captivity (71% and 48%, respectively). Captive-breeding programs operated\n       by zoos and private ranches have effectively increased the numbers of these animals\n       while genetically managing their herds . . . Threats that have reduced these species\u2019\n       numbers to current levels in the wild continue throughout most of the historic range.\n       As future opportunities arise for reintroduction in the antelope range countries,\n       captive-breeding programs will be able to provide genetically diverse and otherwise\n       suitable specimens.\n\n70 Fed. Reg. 52,310-52,311 (Sept. 2, 2005) (internal citation omitted).\n\n       C.      Safari Club International and Exotic Wildlife Association\n\n       The plaintiffs bringing the Motions for Preliminary Injunctions are two private associations\n\nbased in the United States. SCI is a non-profit organization with 53,000 members worldwide. SCI\n\nMem. at 19. SCI\u2019s mission is to \u201cprotect the freedom to hunt and to promote wildlife conservation\n\nworldwide.\u201d Id. Some SCI members own captive herds of the Three Antelope species throughout\n\nthe United States, while others have hunted the Three Antelope species and wish to do so in the\n\nfuture. Id. EWA is an association of ranchers who own the majority of Texas\u2019 exotic wildlife,\n\nwhich they raise on private property. EWA Mem. at 6.\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that private conservation and herding of the Three Antelope species has\n\nbeen helpful for increasing the population of these animals. SCI, for example, argues that \u201c[i]n the\n\nU.S., private conservation, free trade, and the ability to hunt these animals have succeeded in\n\nestablishing large, healthy U.S. populations of each of these species.\u201d SCI Mem. at 2.\n\n       D.      Overview of the Consolidated Cases\n\n       The FWS Final Rule scheduled to go into effect on April 4, 2012 has a history reaching back\n\nmore than two decades. In 1991, the FWS published a proposed rule to list as endangered species\n\nunder the Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) three antelope species, namely, the scimitar-horned\n\noryx, dama gazelle, and addax. See 56 Fed. Reg. 56,491 (Nov. 5, 1991). The FWS opened\n\ncomment periods on this proposed rule on June 8, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 24,220), July 24, 2003 (68\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fFed. Reg. 43,706), and November 26, 2003 (68 Fed. Reg. 66,395). According to the Federal\n\nDefendants, \u201c[f]rom the outset of the rulemaking process, the [FWS] announced that it was\n\nconsidering a separate regulatory scheme to cover captive-held individuals of [the Three Antelope\n\nspecies] outside the species\u2019 natural ranges.\u201d SCI Opp. Mem. at 7 (citing 56 Fed. Reg. at 56,491,\n\n56,492, 56,494 & 68 Fed. Reg. at 43,707). No further action was taken on the introduction of this\n\nproposed rule until February 1, 2005, when the FWS proposed a separate regulatory scheme for\n\ncaptive-bred species. See 70 Fed. Reg. 5117.\n\n       Subsequently, on September 2, 2005, the FWS listed the Three Antelope species as\n\nendangered under the ESA, after finding that the Three Antelope species faced extinction because\n\nof all of the endangered species listing factors other than \u201cdisease or predation.\u201d SCI Opp. Mem. at\n\n8; 70 Fed. Reg. at 52,321-52,322 (Sept. 2, 2005) (\u201cListing Decision\u201d). At the same time, the FWS\n\nadded a new regulation, codified at 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.21(h), authorizing certain otherwise prohibited\n\nactivities for U.S. captive-bred individuals of the Three Antelope species (\u201cCaptive-bred\n\nExemption\u201d). See 70 Fed. Reg. 52,319-52,320 (Sept. 2, 2005). The FWS noted at that time that\n\n\u201c[c]aptive-breeding programs operated by zoos and private ranches have effectively increased the\n\nnumbers of these animals while genetically managing their herds. As future opportunities arise for\n\nreintroduction in the antelope range countries, captive-breeding programs will be able to provide\n\ngenetically diverse and otherwise suitable specimens. Currently, however, continued habitat loss\n\nand wonton killing have made reintroduction [of captive-bred herds to the wild] nonviable in most\n\ncases.\u201d 70 Fed. Reg. at 52,322 (Sept. 2, 2005).\n\n       Animals rights groups, including the defendant-intervenors, subsequently and successfully\n\nfiled suit alleging that the FWS unlawfully promulgated the Captive-bred Exemption. See Friends\n\nof Animals v. Salazar, 626 F. Supp. 2d 102 (D.D.C. 2009) (Kennedy, J.). SCI and EWA intervened\n\nas defendants in that consolidated case. There, Judge Kennedy found that \u201c[a]fter examining the\n\n\n                                                  7\n\ftext, context, purpose and legislative history of section 10 [of ESA] . . . subsection 10(c) requires\n\ncase-by-case consideration before the FWS may permit otherwise prohibited acts to enhance the\n\npropagation or survival of endangered species,\u201d and that the \u201cblanket exemption\u201d reflected by the\n\nCaptive-bred Exemption violated the ESA\u2019s subsection 10(c) requirement to provide public notice\n\nin the Federal Register of each application for a permit allowing such otherwise prohibited acts. Id.\n\nat 116, 118. The court remanded the rule to the FWS for further proceedings.\n\n           In 2010, both SCI and the Owen plaintiffs petitioned the FWS to delist from the endangered\n\nspecies list the U.S. captive-bred herds of the Three Antelope species. See SCI Action, ECF No. 1,\n\nSCI Compl. \u00b6 10; Owen Action, ECF No. 1, Owen Compl. at 2. The FWS has taken no action on\n\nthose petitions other than responding, on September 23, 2010, that \u201cinitial review . . . does not\n\nindicate that an emergency situation exists,\u201d and, on July 25, 2011, that the \u201cService anticipates it\n\nwill be able to make an initial finding on your petition in the next fiscal year.\u201d SCI Mem., Case No.\n\n11-cv-01564, ECF No. 25, Exs. V (Sept. 23, 2010 Letter from Jamie Van Norman, Chief, Branch of\n\nForeign Species, to Anna Seidman, Director of Litigation, SCI), W (July 25, 2011 Letter from Gina\n\nShultz, Chief, Office of ESA Litigation, to Kevin Anderson, President, SCI). 4\n\n           On July 7, 2011, the FWS published a proposed rule to withdraw the Captive-bred\n\nExemption, consistent with the holding in Friends of Animals. See 76 Fed. Reg. 39,804 (\u201cRemoval\n\nof the Regulation that Excludes U.S. Captive-Bred Scimitar-Horned Oryx, Addax, and Dama\n\nGazelle From Certain Prohibitions\u201d) (July 7, 2011). This would eliminate the exclusion for the\n\nThree Antelope species from certain prohibitions in the ESA and require any person intending to\n\nengage in otherwise prohibited activity to qualify for an exemption or obtain a permit authorizing\n\nsuch activity. The FWS opened the proposed rule for a 30-day comment period in which it received\n\n93 individual comments, 2 from state agencies, 8 from nongovernment groups, and 86 from\n\n\n4\n    All references to ECF numbers are references to Case No. 11-cv-01564 unless otherwise noted.\n                                                            8\n\findividuals, most of whom were ranchers or individuals associated with ranches. The vast majority\n\nof the comments opposed the proposed regulation. See 77 Fed Reg. 431, 432 (Jan. 5, 2012).\n\n        The SCI Action was then filed in this district on August 31, 2011, alleging that the Federal\n\nDefendants violated the ESA and Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by including U.S. captive-\n\nbred herds of the Three Antelope species in the 2005 listing determination, failing to remove U.S.\n\ncaptive herds from endangered species status after Judge Kennedy\u2019s ruling, and failing to respond in\n\na timely manner to SCI\u2019s petition for delisting. See SCI Action, ECF No. 1, SCI Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10.\n\nLikewise, the Owen Action, which was filed in the Northern District of Texas in October, 2011,\n\nalleges that the FWS violated the ESA and the APA by failing to respond to the EWA\u2019s petition for\n\ndelisting. See Owen Action, ECF No. 1, Owen Compl. at 2. Following transfer of the Owen Action\n\nto this jurisdiction, this Court consolidated the SCI Action with the Owen Action. See Case No. 11-\n\ncv-01564, Minute Order (Feb. 21, 2012). 5\n\n        On January 5, 2012, FWS issued its final rule removing the Captive-bred Exemption,\n\neffective on April 4, 2012 (\u201cFinal Rule\u201d). 77 Fed. Reg. 431 (Jan. 5, 2012). The Final Rule\n\nexplained that \u201c[t]his change to the regulations is in response to a court order that found that the rule\n\nfor these three species violated section 10(c) of the Act. These three antelope species remain listed\n\nas endangered under the Act, and a person will need to qualify for an exemption or obtain an\n\nauthorization under the current statutory and regulatory requirements to conduct any prohibited\n\nactivities.\u201d Id. The Final Rule stated that the FWS \u201cconsidered whether there were alternative\n\nmeans to comply with the Court\u2019s ruling without requiring ranches or other facilities holding these\n\nspecies to obtain a permit or other authorization\u201d and determined that there was no alternative\n\n\u201cother than the currently established regulations at 50 C.F.R. 17.21(g) and 17.22 \u2013 providing for the\n\nregistration of captive-bred wildlife or issuance of a permit \u2013 that would provide the public an\n5\n The Owen Action was transferred from the Northern District of Texas to this jurisdiction on February 6, 2012. See\nCase No. 12-cv-00194, ECF No. 16. Seven of the nineteen plaintiffs in the Owen Action are also plaintiffs in the EWA\nAction.\n                                                          9\n\fopportunity to comment on proposed activities being carried out with these species.\u201d 77 Fed. Reg.\n\nat 432. The Final Rule also noted that the FWS \u201cdid not receive any comments or suggestions from\n\nthe public that presented a viable alternative.\u201d Id. The FWS provided an \u201cextended effective date\u201d\n\nof April 4, 2012 for the Final Rule in order to \u201callow the affected community to either legally sell\n\ntheir specimens, if they choose to divest themselves of these species, or to apply for authorization or\n\npermits to continue carrying out previously approved activities.\u201d Id.\n\n        The EWA Action was filed on March 2, 2012, to invalidate and set aside the Final Rule. See\n\nEWA Action, ECF No. 1, EWA Compl. at 4. The plaintiffs in the EWA Action filed a Motion for\n\nPreliminary Injunction on March 6, 2012, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Final Rule. See\n\nEWA Action, ECF No. 3.\n\n        On March 8, 2012, the plaintiffs in the SCI Action filed a Motion for a Preliminary\n\nInjunction, seeking more generally to enjoin the \u201cenforcement of endangered status for U.S. non-\n\nnative captive herds of the [Three Antelope species].\u201d See SCI Action, ECF No. 26, at 1.\n\n        The Court addresses both pending motions for a preliminary injunction below.\n\nII.     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The purpose of a preliminary injunction \u201cis merely to preserve the relative positions of the\n\nparties until a trial on the merits can be held.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395\n\n(1981). It is an extraordinary form of interim relief, however, and \u201cshould not be granted unless the\n\nmovant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.\u201d Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S.\n\n968, 972 (1997) (internal citations and emphasis omitted). Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary\n\ninjunction must establish that (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims; (2) they\n\nare likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary injunctive relief; (3) the balance\n\nof equities tip in their favor; and (4) injunctive relief is sought in the public interest. Winter v.\n\nNRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 724 (D.C. Cir. 2011); CityFed\n\n\n                                                    10\n\fFin. Corp. v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 746 (D.C. Cir. 1995). Historically, these\n\nfour factors have been evaluated on a \u201csliding scale\u201d in this Circuit, such that a stronger showing on\n\none factor could make up for a weaker showing on another. See Davenport v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of\n\nTeamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 360-61 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Recently, however, the continued viability of\n\nthat approach has been called into some doubt, as the United States Court of Appeals for the District\n\nof Columbia Circuit has suggested, without holding, that a likelihood of success on the merits is an\n\nindependent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction. See Sherley v. Sebelius, 644\n\nF.3d 388, 392-93 (D.C. Cir. 2011). However, absent binding authority or clear guidance from the\n\nCourt of Appeals, the Court considers the most prudent course to bypass this unresolved issue and\n\nproceed to explain why a preliminary injunction is not appropriate under the \u201csliding scale\u201d\n\nframework. If the plaintiffs cannot meet the less demanding \u201csliding scale\u201d standard, then they\n\ncannot satisfy the more stringent standard alluded to by the Court of Appeals.\n\n       That being said, in meeting the requisite burden for injunctive relief, \u201c[i]t is particularly\n\nimportant for the [plaintiffs] to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d Konarski v.\n\nDonovan, 763 F. Supp. 2d 128, 132 (D.D.C. 2011). Without a \u201csubstantial indication\u201d of the\n\n[plaintiffs\u2019] likelihood of success on the merits, \u201cthere would be no justification for the court\u2019s\n\nintrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review.\u201d Elite Entm\u2019t, Inc. v.\n\nReshammiya, No. 08-cv-0641, 2008 U.S. Dist.

Supp. 2d 114, 140 (D.D.C. 1999)).\n\nAssessing the likelihood of success on the merits \u201cdoes not involve a final determination of the\n\nmerits, but rather the exercise of sound judicial discretion on the need for interim relief.\u201d Nat\u2019l Org.\n\nfor Women, Wash.

Supp. 2d at 133;\n\nDorfmann v. Boozer, 414 F.2d 1168, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1969).\n\n       Under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (C), an agency\n\naction may be overturned if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\n\naccordance with law\u201d or \u201cin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of\n\nstatutory right.\u201d Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council, 490 U.S. 360, 376 n.21 (1989). Review of\n\nagency actions under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and \u201cpresumes\n\nthe agency\u2019s action to be valid.\u201d Envt\u2019l.

Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971). \u201cThe scope of the Court\u2019s review\n\nunder this standard \u2018is narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u2019\u201d\n\nUnited Steel v.

DISCUSSION\n\n       In filing their Motions for Injunctive Relief, the plaintiffs are asking this Court to evaluate\n\nthe chance of their success on the merits of their claims in order to decide whether they should be\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fawarded the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief. In this consolidated case, the plaintiffs\u2019\n\nchance of success on the merits must be evaluated separately as the plaintiffs are challenging\n\ndifferent rules in their Complaints and thus relying on different administrative records. The Court\n\nfinds that neither SCI\u2019s challenge to the 2005 Listing Decision, nor the EWA plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to\n\nthe 2012 Final Rule appears at this stage to have a likelihood of success on the merits. 6 Nor have\n\nthe plaintiffs carried their heavy burden of demonstrating irreparable harm in the absence of\n\npreliminary relief, nor that the balance of equities tip in their favor. Finally, the plaintiffs have not\n\ncarried their burden of showing that injunctive relief is truly in the public interest. The Court\n\ndiscusses each of these factors seriatim below. 7\n\n    1.        Plaintiffs Do Not Establish A Likelihood Of Success On The Merits\n\n              a. SCI Action\n\n         SCI filed its lawsuit in order to challenge the FWS decision, over six years ago, in 2005, to\n\nlist the non-native, captive members of the Three Antelope species as endangered species. SCI\n\nargues in support of its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction that the FWS (1) \u201cacted arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously and in a manner inconsistent with ongoing agency decision-making made for other\n\nsimilarly situated species\u201d and (2) \u201cignored the conservation mandates of the ESA and the fact that\n6\n The Court notes that the arguments considered here regarding the merits of the claims may be supplemented once\nbriefing is complete on the pending motions for summary judgment. Even if these other arguments would persuade the\nCourt on the merits, the plaintiffs would still not meet the other criteria required for preliminary injunctive relief, as\nexplained below.\n7\n  As an initial matter, the Court finds that the plaintiffs have standing to seek relief, which is unchallenged by the\nFederal Defendants. \u201c[T]he requirement that a claimant have \u2018standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-\nor-controversy requirement of Article III.\u2019\u201d Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 733 (2008) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). In order to establish standing under Article III, a claimant must show: (1) it has\nsuffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to\nmerely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61; Sierra Club\nv. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 898 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \u201cAn association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when\nits members would have standing to sue in their own right, the interests at stake are germane to the organization\u2019s\npurpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires individual members\u2019 participation in the\nlawsuit.\u201d Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt\u2019l. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-181 (2000) (citing Hunt v.\nWashington State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). While the Court concludes that the plaintiffs\nhave not shown that they face \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d the plaintiffs have demonstrated \u201can injury in fact\u201d that is concrete\nand particularized, actual or imminent, fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s actions, and potentially remedied by this\nCourt\u2019s decision. The plaintiffs therefore have standing and this Court may properly hear their claims.\n                                                             13\n\finclusion of the captive populations would harm rather than serve the conservation of populations of\n\nthe three antelope species.\u201d SCI Mem. at 22. The Federal Defendants argue that SCI is unlikely to\n\nsucceed on the merits for three reasons: (1) SCI has not shown that the FWS \u201chas a policy of\n\nexcluding animals held in captivity when listing a foreign species;\u201d (2) SCI \u201chas failed to show that\n\n[FWS] was required to designate captive members of the Three Antelope species in the United\n\nStates as a distinct population;\u201d and (3) SCI \u201chas not shown that the Listing Rule is inconsistent\n\nwith the conservation purpose of the ESA.\u201d SCI Opp. Mem. at 13-14. The Court concludes that\n\nSCI has not established a likelihood of success on the merits because SCI has not shown that the\n\nFWS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in deciding to list the Three Antelope species as endangered.\n\nAs the Court explains, the Listing Decision (1) was issued only after years of consultation and\n\nresearch, and appears to be consistent (2) with the policy and practice of the FWS as well as (3)\n\nwith the purpose of the ESA.\n\n               i.       The FWS Decision to List the Three Antelope Species As Endangered\n                        Was the Result of Many Years of Consultation and Research\n\n       The FWS decision to list the Three Antelope species was reached only after a period of\n\nmany years of research and consultation. Indeed, SCI acknowledges that the FWS devoted\n\nsignificant time over many years to developing its policies with respect to the Three Antelope\n\nspecies. SCI references FWS\u2019 \u201cprotracted deliberation over the listing status of the three species,\u201d\n\nsee SCI Mem. at 5, and the \u201c14 years that [FWS] collected data and analyzed its legal strategies for\n\ndealing with the thriving and growing U.S captive population.\u201d SCI Mem. at 8. SCI notes, for\n\nexample, that the FWS \u201cwas well aware that it had listing options that would allow the [FWS] to\n\nexclude those U.S. non-native captive members from the endangered classification of the animals in\n\nthe wild . . . .\u201d Id. The FWS also \u201cdrafted early versions of the Antelope Listing Rule, relying on\n\nits authority to treat the U.S. non-native captive populations differently than the populations in the\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fwild.\u201d Id. at 9. The FWS approach thus seems to have been a thorough one, in which the FWS\n\ncomprehensively reviewed the possible ways in which to regulate the Three Antelope species.\n\n                  ii.      The FWS Decision to List the Three Antelope Species As Endangered\n                           Was Consistent with FWS Policy and Practice\n\n         SCI argues that the FWS \u201cacted arbitrarily and capriciously and in a manner inconsistent\n\nwith ongoing agency decision-making made for other similarly situated species.\u201d SCI Mem. at 22.\n\n\u201cIn its consideration of other captive and/or non-native populations of species that . . . had no direct\n\nconnection with the conservation of the species in the wild, the [FWS] . . . dealt separately with\n\nthose captive and/or non-native populations and in some cases had not listed them at all.\u201d 8 Id. at 25.\n\nThe FWS decision not to make separate listing decisions for wild populations and captive\n\npopulations of the Three Antelope species when it has done so in other cases, however, does not\n\nmean that the FWS listing decision was arbitrary and capricious. SCI cites in particular four\n\nexamples where the FWS purportedly decided to treat captive animals differently than their wild\n\ncounterparts. SCI Mem. at 26-30 (discussing listing decisions for Nile Crocodile, the Chimpanzee,\n\nthe Arkansas River Shiner, and the Arctic Grayling). The FWS, for example, classified \u201cranched\n\npopulations\u201d of the Nile Crocodile as \u201cthreatened\u201d while it left other populations of the species\n\nclassified as \u201cendangered.\u201d SCI Mem. at 26; see Reclassification of Ranched Nile Crocodile\n\nPopulations in Zimbabwe From Endangered to Threatened, 52 Fed. Reg. 23,148 (June 17, 1987);\n\nsee also Revised 12-Month Finding to List the Upper Missouri River Distinct Population Segment\n\nof Arctic Grayling as Endangered or Threatened, 75 Fed. Reg. 54,708, 54,712-13 (Sept. 8, 2010);\n\nFinal Rule to List the Arkansas River Basin Population of the Arkansas River Shiner (Notropis\n8\n  The Federal Defendants argue that SCI waived this argument about the designation of animals held in captivity by not\nraising it during the comment period. The Court disagrees. To the extent that this issue was not raised during the\ncomment period, that is understandable because the FWS itself was contemplating creating a different rule for animals\nheld in captivity versus animals held in the wild. See, e.g, Proposed Endangered Status for Scimitar-horned Oryx,\nAddax, and Dama Gazelle, 56 Fed. Reg. 56,491 (Nov. 5, 1991) (\u201cCaptive and free-roaming groups, outside of the\nnatural ranges of the species, may be covered separately from natural populations in any final rule.\u201d). Furthermore, \u201c[i]t\nis sufficient that an issue was raised by any commentator; the party petitioning for judicial review need not have done so\nitself.\u201d Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Auth. v. EPA, 358 F.3d 936, 948 n.12 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citing Reytblatt v.\nNuclear Regulatory Comm\u2019n., 105 F.3d 715, 721 (D.C. Cir. 1997)).\n                                                           15\n\fgirardi) as Threatened, 63 Fed. Reg. 64,772 (Nov. 23, 1998); Endangered Status for Chimpanzee\n\nand Pygmy Chimpanzee, 55 Fed. Reg. 9129 (Mar. 12, 1990). SCI argues, therefore, that the FWS\n\ndecision not to differentiate between wild and captive antelope when listing the Three Antelope\n\nSpecies was inconsistent. \u201cInconsistency, without an explanation,\u201d SCI argues, \u201cqualifies as\n\narbitrary and capricious agency action.\u201d SCI Reply in Support of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\u201cSCI\n\nReply\u201d) at 1.\n\n         The Court disagrees. SCI\u2019s arguments fail because the treatment of the wild and captive\n\nanimals in their examples are just that\u2014examples. The plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence\n\nsuggesting that differentiating between wild and captive animals in listing decisions is a policy of\n\nthe FWS, nor that any policy was abrogated when the FWS decided not to differentiate between\n\nwild and captive animal populations when listing the Three Antelope species as endangered. In\n\nfact, the Federal Defendants note that the examples cited by SCI are \u201cfour isolated listing decisions\n\nout of thousands that the [FWS] has made since Congress enacted the ESA in 1973.\u201d SCI Opp.\n\nMem. at 14. An agency decision to treat the wild and captive antelope together in the Listing\n\nDecision came only after consideration over the period from 1991 to 2005. The fact that the FWS\n\nhas over time differentiated between wild and captive animals in the case of other animal species\n\ndoes not, on its own, suggest to the Court that the decision not to do so in this case was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious. 9\n\n         Indeed, the examples cited by SCI are not even necessarily analogous to the Three Antelope\n\nspecies in captivity. The Federal Defendants point out that two of the examples cited by SCI (the\n\nArkansas River Shiner and the Arctic Grayling) do not even involve \u201ccaptive\u201d populations, see SCI\n\n9\n  SCI argues that \u201c[t]he issue is not whether the FWS had any sort of policy to deal with inclusion or exclusion of non-\nnative captive members of a species for the purposes of listing. The point is that the [FWS] had, on other occasions,\nfollowed a practice of disparately classifying captive and wild populations. When the FWS addressed the three antelope\nspecies, it claimed that it could not treat captive populations differently and yet failed to explain the reason for that\ninconsistency.\u201d SCI Reply at 10. This argument is unavailing. This Court will not grant preliminary injunctive relief\non the basis that associations are dissatisfied with an agency\u2019s explanation for why, after years of considering an issue,\nit did not decide the issue the same way it decided another issue related to a completely different animal species.\n                                                           16\n\fOpp. Mem. at 16, which makes them wholly distinguishable from the Three Antelope species. The\n\nFederal Defendants also note that disparate treatment of captive and native populations of Nile\n\nCrocodiles was abolished in less than 18 months. See SCI Opp. Mem at 18 n.7 (citing 53 Fed. Reg.\n\n38,451 (Sept. 30, 1998); 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.11(h)). The FWS was also \u201crecently petitioned to list all\n\nchimpanzees as endangered. . . .\u201d Id. (citing 76 Fed. Reg. 54,423 (Sept. 1, 2011)). If all\n\nchimpanzees are listed as endangered, the Federal Defendants argue that there would be \u201cno\n\ninstances in which members of a species held in captivity are designated differently than the species\n\nin the wild.\u201d Id. The argument that the FWS made a wildly \u201cinconsistent\u201d decision here by not\n\ndistinguishing the wild and captive populations of the Three Antelope species is unavailing. SCI\n\nhas simply not demonstrated that FWS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in treating captive animals\n\ndifferently than native animals in its decision to list the Three Antelope species as endangered. 10\n\n         Nor has SCI shown that the FWS was obligated to designate a \u201cDistinct Population Segment\n\nPolicy\u201d (\u201cDPS\u201d) as it did in the cases of the Nile Crocodile and Chimpanzee, or to provide a reason\n\nfor not creating a DPS. First, the FWS may designate a DPS, in which an animal species is\n\ndesignated differently based on whether it is captive or in the wild, in its discretion. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1533(a)(1) (\u201cThe Secretary shall . . . determine whether any species is an endangered species or\n\nthreatened species . . .\u201d). Second, although a party may petition the FWS to determine whether\n\ndesignation of a DPS is appropriate, see 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(b)(3)(A), SCI did not do so before the\n\nListing Rule went into effect, according to Federal Defendants. See SCI Opp. Mem. at 20. Thus,\n\nthe FWS was not required to designate a DPS, nor to explain why it had not done so. The resulting\n\nlisting decision, while different than the decision to distinguish between captive and native\n\n\n10\n  SCI argues that \u201c[f]ederal defendants . . . incorrectly inform the Court\u201d that the chimpanzees are the last example of a\ncase where the FWS has differentiated between captive and wild populations. SCI Reply at 12. SCI points to\nclassification of the Southern Resident killer whale by the National Marine Fisheries Service as another example. See\n70 Fed. Reg. 69,903, 69,910-11 (Nov. 18, 2005). Nevertheless, the Court is still not convinced that examples of this\ntype demonstrate that the FWS has in this case acted arbitrarily and capriciously by grouping together the wild and\ncaptive populations of the Three Antelope species in its Listing Decision.\n                                                           17\n\fmembers of the Chimpanzee and the Nile Crocodile species, has not been shown to be arbitrary and\n\ncapricious.\n\n               iii.    The FWS Decision to List the Captive Populations as Endangered Was\n                       Consistent with the Purpose of the Endangered Species Act\n\n       SCI argues that the FWS \u201cignored the conservation mandates of the ESA and the fact that\n\ninclusion of the captive populations would harm rather than serve the conservation of populations of\n\nthe three antelope species.\u201d SCI Mem. at 22. The Federal Defendants, however, respond that the\n\nFWS interpretation of the ESA, as embodied in the Listing Rule, is consistent with the purposes of\n\nthe ESA. SCI Opp. Mem. at 21. The Court agrees.\n\n       The purposes of the ESA are enumerated in section 1531(b):\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which\n       endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved, to provide a\n       program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and\n       to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and\n       conventions set forth in subsection (a) of this section.\n\n16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b).\n\n       SCI has not shown that the FWS has \u201cignored the conservation mandates of the ESA.\u201d\n\nIndeed, by listing both the captive and wild populations of the Three Antelope species as\n\nendangered, the FWS has ensured that prohibitions against taking, importing, and exporting will\n\napply to all members of the Three Antelope species. There will be no confusion about whether a\n\nparty is attempting to \u201ctake\u201d a captive-bred antelope or a wild antelope as there might be if only\n\nsome of the Three Antelope species were considered \u201cendangered.\u201d The FWS\u2019 decision to list the\n\nU.S. non-native captive-bred members of the Three Antelope species as endangered was clearly not\n\n\u201cerratic,\u201d as SCI argues. SCI Mem. at 25. It was not \u201cunexplained,\u201d nor \u201cinconsistent.\u201d Id. at 44.\n\nRather, it was based on years of research and included several comment periods.\n\n       SCI notes that the FWS itself acknowledged in 2005 that \u201c[l]isting the species without\n\nexempting the U.S. captive-bred population could be a deterrent to further captive breeding.\u201d\n                                                  18\n\fUnited States Department of Interior, Record of Compliance for a Rulemaking Document, signed\n\nby Robert R. Gabel, Acting Assistant Director, International Affairs, AR 237.0122, ECF No. 26,\n\nEx. S (Jan. 5, 2005) (cited in SCI Reply at 17-18). This is not a surprising revelation given that the\n\nFWS promulgated the exemption for the captive-bred Three Antelope species at the same time as it\n\nlisted them as endangered. Following Friends of Animals, however, the FWS needed to develop a\n\nregulation that was consistent with Judge Kennedy\u2019s decision that the exemption violated section 10\n\nof the ESA. The FWS decision to remove the exemption rather than to promulgate an alternative\n\nregulation, or to delist the captive-bred Three Antelope species, has not been shown to be arbitrary\n\nand capricious. Accordingly, SCI has not demonstrated that the initial Listing Decision was\n\n\u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and thus has not shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits.\n\n           b. EWA Action\n\n       The EWA plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction asks the Court to enjoin the Final\n\nRule, which is the same rule the EWA plaintiffs challenge in their underlying lawsuit. The EWA\n\nplaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because (1) \u201cthere is no support in the\n\nrecord for the permitting scheme[,]\u201d EWA Mem. at 19; (2) \u201cFWS failed to consider alternatives to\n\nthe permitting scheme[,]\u201d id. at 21; and (3) \u201cFWS failed to consider delisting the U.S. captive-bred\n\npopulations.\u201d Id. at 30. The EWA plaintiffs further argue that the Final Rule is contrary to law (4)\n\n\u201cbecause it destroys rather than conserves the species as required by [section 7(a)(2) of] the ESA[,]\u201d\n\nid. at 31; and (5) \u201cbecause FWS failed to consider the environmental impacts as required by the\n\n[National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d)]\u201d. Id. at 34. The Federal Defendants argue that the\n\nEWA plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims because the plaintiffs have not\n\nprovided legal support for their claims and because their claims are otherwise meritless.\n\nSpecifically, the Federal Defendants argue that (1) the Final Rule \u201cis entirely rational and supported\n\nby the record[,]\u201d EWA Opp. Mem. at 16; (2) the FWS \u201cadequately responded to comments and, to\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fthe extent required, adequately considered alternatives,\u201d id. at 18; (3) the FWS \u201cdid not have to\n\nconsider delisting the U.S. population of the three antelope species in the context of the removal of\n\nthe management rule[,]\u201d id. at 20; (4) and, since the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to provide the required notice\n\nfor their Section 7 claim, the [FWS] did not have to consult under ESA Section 7, and in any case,\n\nthe [Final Rule] will not jeopardize the continued existence of the species.\u201d Id. at 24. The Federal\n\nDefendants also argue that the plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their NEPA claim. Id. at 26-\n\n31. For the reasons explained below, the Court agrees that the EWA plaintiffs have not established\n\nthat they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.\n\n               i.      The Final Rule Is Supported by the Record\n\n       The EWA plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious \u201cbecause there is no\n\nsupport in the record for the permitting scheme.\u201d EWA Mem. at 19. The plaintiffs argue that the\n\nFWS\u2019 assertion that it \u201cdoes not believe that ranchers or other holders of these species that are\n\nworking for the conservation of the species will reduce or eliminate their herds just because a\n\npermit or other authorization will be required\u201d is baseless because the record is \u201cchockfull\u201d of\n\ncomments stating that \u201cthese three species will soon disappear from the face of the earth if the\n\npermitting scheme [in] the rule is imposed on the ranchers.\u201d Id. at 19-20. \u201cThat FWS simply\n\nignored this evidence and promulgated the rule anyway,\u201d the EWA plaintiffs argue, \u201cis plainly\n\narbitrary and capricious.\u201d Id. at 21.\n\n       The Federal Defendants argue, however, that the decision to issue the Final Rule was a\n\n\u201crational\u201d one supported by the record. EWA Opp. Mem. at 16. Specifically, the Federal\n\nDefendants argue that the FWS issued the Final Rule in order to comply with Judge Kennedy\u2019s\n\ndecision in Friends of Animals. Id. at 16. They argue that they had \u201cto act to comply with the\n\nCourt\u2019s order and, conversely, not acting would have allowed a regulation that violates the ESA to\n\nremain in place.\u201d Id. The Court agrees. Judge Kennedy ruled that the FWS rule exempting the\n\n\n                                                   20\n\fThree Antelope species from many of the regulations and prohibitions of ESA violated ESA section\n\n10(c), by not providing the public notice and an opportunity to comment on each permit application,\n\nand remanded the matter to the FWS for further proceedings consistent with his decision. The\n\nFWS\u2019 decision to remove the exemption for captive-bred animals of the Three Antelope species\n\nwas consistent with Judge Kennedy\u2019s decision. The FWS decision means that the Three Antelope\n\nspecies will be subject to the permitting requirements attendant to animals listed as \u201cendangered\u201d\n\nunder the Endangered Species Act. The Court agrees with the Federal Defendants that the decision\n\nto issue a Final Decision consistent with Judge Kennedy\u2019s opinion, and after a public comment\n\nperiod, was not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n               ii.     The FWS Adequately Responded to Comments and Considered\n                       Alternatives to the Final Rule to the Extent it Was Required to Do So\n\n       The EWA plaintiffs next argue that the Final Rule is \u201carbitrary and capricious because FWS\n\nfailed to consider alternatives to the permitting scheme.\u201d EWA Mem. at 21. \u201cNot only did FWS\n\nimpose an arbitrary, one-size-fits-all rule never meant to apply to these ranches,\u201d the EWA plaintiffs\n\nargue, but \u201cFWS also completely failed to consider any alternative to the permitting scheme\n\nenvisioned in the final rule.\u201d Id. As the Federal Defendants point out, the EWA plaintiffs do not\n\npoint to any authority to suggest that the FWS had to consider any other particular alternatives.\n\nEWA Opp. Mem. at 18; see, e.g, WHHT, Inc. v. FCC, 656 F.2d 807, 818 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (\u201cIt is\n\nonly in the rarest and most compelling of circumstances that this court has acted to overturn an\n\nagency judgment not to institute rulemaking.\u201d). Even so, the FWS noted in the preamble to the\n\nFinal Rule that it had \u201cconsidered whether there were alternative means to comply with the Court\u2019s\n\nruling [in Friends of Animals] without requiring ranches or other facilities holding these species to\n\nobtain a permit or other authorization.\u201d 77 Fed. Reg. at 432. \u201cHowever,\u201d the FWS noted, it \u201cwas\n\nunable to identify an alternative other than the currently established regulations at 50 C.F.R.\n\n17.21(g) and 17.22 \u2013 providing for the registration of captive-bred wildlife or issuance of a permit \u2013\n                                                  21\n\fthat would provide the public an opportunity to comment on proposed activities being carried out\n\nwith these species.\u201d Id.\n\n       The EWA plaintiffs also argue that the FWS failed to respond to numerous comments about\n\nthe Final Rule during the comment period. EWA Mem. at 22-30. The FWS argues convincingly,\n\nhowever, that it was not required to respond to alternatives to removing the exemption rule if the\n\nalternative suggestions did not \u201coffer a solution to fix the ESA Section 10(c) problem . . . .\u201d EWA\n\nOpp. Mem. at 19. Since the FWS only proposed the Final Rule in order to be consistent with Judge\n\nKennedy\u2019s decision with respect to ESA Section 10(c), not answering those comments that were\n\noutside of the scope of this rulemaking is not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n               iii.    The FWS Was Not Required To Consider Delisting the Captive-Bred\n                       Three Antelope Species\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is \u201carbitrary and capricious because FWS failed to\n\nconsider delisting the U.S. captive-bred populations.\u201d EWA Mem. at 30. The EWA plaintiffs argue\n\nthat \u201c[f]or no reason at all FWS refused to consider removing the three species from the endangered\n\nspecies list \u2013 even though they would not have been listed without the tandem exemption rule back\n\nin 2005 . . . .\u201d Id. The Federal Defendants argue, and the Court agrees, however, that FWS was not\n\nrequired to initiate a delisting of the Three Antelope species, or even consider a delisting, as part of\n\nits rulemaking with respect to the Final Rule. EWA Opp. Mem. at 20-23. Not considering delisting\n\nthe captive-bred species from endangered species status does not establish that the FWS acted\n\narbitrary and capriciously in issuing the Final Rule.\n\n               iv.     Plaintiffs Have Not Shown That The Challenged Rule Is Contrary To\n                       Law \u201cBecause It Destroys Rather Than Conserves The Species As\n                       Required By The ESA\u201d\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is \u201ccontrary to law because it destroys rather than\n\nconserves the species as required by the ESA.\u201d EWA Mem. at 31. The EWA plaintiffs argue that\n\nthat \u201cFWS was obligated under the ESA to ensure the conservation of these three species of\n                                                   22\n\fendangered antelope but did not do so . . . .\u201d Id. at 34. \u201cSince the ultimate goal of the ESA is for\n\nspecies to be removed from the endangered or threatened lists because of recovery,\u201d the EWA\n\nplaintiffs argue, \u201caction that limits (or prevents) the endangered antelope populations from\n\nrecovering is contrary to the requirements of the ESA.\u201d Id. at 32. The EWA plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe permitting requirements that will go into effect on April 4, 2012 will \u201cresult in a reduction of the\n\nreproduction, numbers, and distribution of the antelope,\u201d which will mean a \u201cdecrease in genetic\n\ndiversity,\u201d and will \u201calso ultimately reduce the sustainable population size.\u201d Id. at 33-34. The FWS\n\nconsidered these possible implications of the Final Rule, however, and disagreed with the plaintiffs.\n\nThe Federal Defendants note in particular that the FWS \u201cconsidered the possibility that holders of\n\nU.S. captive members of the Three Antelope species might dispose of their stock rather than obtain\n\nauthorization or permits before carrying out previously exempted activities and determined that it\n\ndid not believe this would occur, and, if it did, that it would not significantly impact the\n\nconservation of the species.\u201d EWA Opp. Mem. at 31 (citing 77 Fed. Reg. at 433 (Resp. to Cmt. 4)).\n\nWhile the plaintiffs have raised compelling questions about the implications of the Final Rule, the\n\nCourt concludes that the plaintiffs have not shown that the FWS decision to issue the Final Rule\n\nwas contrary to law. Accordingly, while the Court need not reach a final decision on the plaintiffs\u2019\n\nclaims in the context of the instant motions, it concludes that plaintiffs have not carried the burden\n\nof showing their likelihood of success on the merits, as would be necessary for this Court to grant\n\npreliminary injunctive relief. 11\n\n\n\n\n11\n   The plaintiffs also argue that the Final Rule is \u201ccontrary to law because FWS failed to consider the environmental\nimpacts as required by the NEPA.\u201d EWA Mem. at 34. Under Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, agencies shall \u201cinclude in\nevery recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the\nquality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on,\u201d inter alia, \u201cthe environmental\nimpact of the proposed action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332. The EWA plaintiffs argue that the FWS \u201ccircumvented compliance\nwith these requirements, claiming that the rulemaking in this case was \u2018administrative\u2019 and \u2018legal\u2019 in nature, and\nrequired by the district court\u2019s invalidation of an earlier rule.\u201d EWA Mem. at 34. The Court concludes that the EWA\nplaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on this question. The Court declines, however, to provide a detailed\nstatutory analysis on this issue until there is more complete briefing from the parties.\n                                                          23\n\f   2.      Plaintiffs Do Not Establish That A Preliminary Injunction Is Necessary To Prevent\n           Irreparable Harm\n\n        The plaintiffs argue that, although the Final Rule does not go into effect until April 4, 2012,\n\n\u201cthe harm is already occurring.\u201d SCI Mem. at 32. The FWS\u2019 enforcement of the endangered\n\nspecies status, SCI argues, has already \u201cproved to be cataclysmic for the conservation of these\n\nspecies.\u201d Id. at 41. EWA argues that \u201c[t]he draconian effect of this new rule is easy to predict since\n\npublication of the proposed rule last summer, many owners have already disposed of half or all of\n\ntheir oryx, addax and dama gazelles.\u201d EWA Mem. at 2. These claims about the adverse impact on\n\nthe U.S. herds of these endangered species from the Final Rule, even before it becomes effective,\n\nare obviously disturbing. Neither SCI nor the EWA plaintiffs have shown, however, that they are\n\nentitled to a preliminary injunction because they will suffer irreparable harm. In the case of both\n\nSCI and the EWA plaintiffs, the harm alleged is (1) primarily economic and (2) in any case,\n\nremedied by the permit practice that is already in place.\n\n               a.      Alleged Irreparable Harm is Primarily Economic\n\n        The plaintiffs\u2019 primary arguments for irreparable harm are economic harm arguments. SCI\n\nargues that \u201c[t]he value of these animals has plummeted which has severely undermined the ability\n\nof ranchers to continue to invest in these animals and to continue to feed, maintain, and breed these\n\nanimals.\u201d SCI Mem. at 32. SCI emphasizes that \u201c[t]he reality of conservation is that it is dependent\n\nupon funding.\u201d Id. According to SCI, some ranchers have already sold their herds of the Three\n\nAntelope species in anticipation of the Final Rule, which has led to an increase in sellers, resulting\n\nin a \u201cglut in the market and a precipitous drop in the value of these animals.\u201d Id. These events,\n\naccording to SCI, \u201cdemonstrate the irreparable harm that the enforcement of endangered status is\n\nbringing to the conservation of these animals and to those who wish to own, hunt, conserve, and\n\notherwise enjoy them.\u201d SCI Mem. at 33; Decl. of Thomas Wier, Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No.\n\n26, Ex.

See Ed Valicek Decl., Case No. 12-cv-00340, ECF No. 3, Ex. L, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5 (noting that he has\n\nalready reduced his herd from between 75-100 animals to 47 and plans to sell the rest if the FWS\n\npermitting requirements go into effect); Tommy E.

The EWA\n\nplaintiffs tell of the economic loss to individual ranchers. Eddy Blassingame, for example, \u201cbought\n\nhis exotic animal ranch and started breeding scimitar-horned oryx with the dream of passing along\n\nsomething to his children and grandchildren.\u201d EWA Mem. at 40. \u201c[W]ith the permitting\n\nrequirements . . . ,\u201d however, \u201cand the resulting impact on the values of the animals and the ranch as\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fa whole, he now sees it as more of [a] liability.\u201d Id. at 40-41. The EWA plaintiffs argue that these\n\nstories of loss are not isolated to individuals and are reflected community-wide amongst those\n\nranchers involved with the Three Antelope species, noting with linguistic flourish that \u201c[f]ew\n\nplagues have proved as lethal to a species as the FWS [F]inal [R]ule.\u201d Id. at 41.\n\n        The Court does not underestimate the significance of the economic loss to individual\n\nranchers resulting from the depreciation in the value of the animals. Nevertheless, the standard for\n\nshowing irreparable harm in this jurisdiction is strict, and economic harm alone is generally not\n\nsufficient to warrant this Court\u2019s granting of a motion for a preliminary injunction. The D.C.\n\nCircuit has made it clear that \u201ceconomic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985). In Wisconsin Gas Co., the D.C.\n\nCircuit emphasized that \u201c\u2018[t]he key word in this consideration is irreparable. Mere injuries,\n\nhowever substantial, in terms of money, time and energy necessarily expended in the absence of a\n\nstay are not enough. The possibility that adequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be\n\navailable at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation weighs heavily against a claim of\n\nirreparable harm.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass\u2019n v. FPC, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1958)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[r]ecoverable monetary loss may\n\nconstitute irreparable harm only where the loss threatens the very existence of the movant\u2019s\n\nbusiness.\u201d Id. (citing Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission v. Holiday Tours, Inc.,\n\n559 F.2d 841, 843 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). While the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are\n\nfacing or may face significant economic loss, they have not demonstrated that the existence of their\n\nbusinesses is imperiled by the market changes in the economic value of the Three Antelope\n\nspecies. 12\n\n\n12\n  The economic success of the private ranchers depends on the willingness of sportsmen to pay thousands of dollars for\nthe opportunity to hunt an animal from the Three Antelope species. See Decl. of Timothy Mark Terry, ECF No. 26, Ex.\nCC, \u00b6 11 (\u201cI sold scimitar-horned oryx hunts for $2,750 and addax hunts for $5,000); see also SCI Notice of\nInformation Regarding Permit Implications, ECF No. 57, at 2 (\u201cthe hunting and sale of hunts . . . have been the\n                                                         26\n\f        Furthermore, the plaintiffs have not shown that a temporary injunction would stop or reverse\n\nthe drop in the value of these animals that has already taken place. Thus, to the extent that the\n\nplaintiffs are presenting purely economic harm arguments, these arguments do not suffice to\n\nwarrant the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief.\n\n             b.           Any Potential Irreparable Harm is Remedied By The Permitting\n                          Regulations Already in Place\n\n        Although SCI acknowledges that \u201cthe underpinnings\u201d of the harm it is alleging are financial,\n\nSCI argues that \u201cthe harm cannot be recompensed via the reimbursement of funds\u201d and the \u201closs to\n\nconservation is the irreparable harm that only an injunction can remedy.\u201d SCI Mem. at 32-33.\n\nLikewise, the EWA plaintiffs also emphasize that this economic loss does more than devastate the\n\nranchers. Specifically, they state that there is a \u201crush on hunting these three antelope species\u201d since\n\nthe notice of the FWS Final Rule. EWA Mem. at 42. \u201cWhile the market has dropped out for the\n\nExotic Wildlife Ranchers who wish to breed, raise, conserve, and have \u2018live sales\u2019 of these species,\n\nthe same cannot be said for those wishing to hunt the species. In fact, the FWS rule has caused an\n\nexplosion of hunting before the rule goes into effect.\u201d Id. The EWA plaintiffs also argue that the\n\nelimination of the U.S. captive-bred members of the Three Antelope species may also \u201chalt efforts\n\nto reintroduce these species in their native lands.\u201d Id. The Federal Defendants argue that SCI will\n\nnot be irreparably harmed with respect to its interest in the conservation of the Three Antelope\n\nspecies because ranchers \u201cshould be able to continue [their] activities,\u201d but will now require a\n\npermit to do so. SCI Opp. Mem. at 29 (quoting 77 Fed. Reg. at 433). The Court agrees that any\n\npotential irreparable harm with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the animals, and conservation of\n\nthe animals, is remedied by the permitting regulations that are already in place.\n\n\n\nmainstay of the three antelope species\u2019 conservation for the last few decades.\u201d). If, as claimed, fewer ranchers handle\nthese animals, no party explains whether the value of and concomitant price for such hunts may increase to the benefit\nof those ranchers who both continue to support the animals and engage in the available permitting process to allow such\nhunts.\n                                                          27\n\f        The regulations in place after the Final Rule goes into effect on April 4, 2012 should allow\n\nplaintiffs to continue raising the animals from the Three Antelope species. First, the ESA does not\n\nregulate \u201cpurely intrastate activities (with the exception of take).\u201d 77 Fed. Reg. at 433. Thus,\n\nplaintiffs will be able to continue to possess animals, transport them within the state, or sell them to\n\nanother party within the state without a permit. SCI Opp. Mem. at 29. Beyond those activities,\n\npermits will be available for many of the other activities currently engaged in by the plaintiffs. The\n\nFederal Defendants explain:\n\n        For example, to sell and transport these animals between States, Plaintiff\u2019s members\n        may either obtain an interstate commerce permit for the sale (Form 3-200-37) or they\n        may engage in multiple interstate sales if both parties register for a \u201ccaptive-bred\n        wildlife\u201d (or CBW) permit (Form 3-200-41). Van Norman Decl. \u00b6 3. If Plaintiff\u2019s\n        members get a captive-bred wildlife permit, they may also cull their animals as\n        necessary to maintain a viable and healthy herd. Id. Plaintiff\u2019s members that obtain\n        a captive-bred wildlife permit, however, are required to submit annual reports to the\n        Service (Form 3-200-41a). Id. \u00b6 4. The interstate commerce permit is valid for a\n        single sale; the captive-bred wildlife permits are valid for five years. Id. \u00b6 3. More\n        than 400 facilities nation-wide currently hold captive-bred wildlife permits\n        (including both zoos and individual hobbyists). Id. \u00b6 9. In addition, if Plaintiff\u2019s\n        members want to allow hunters to come onto their ranches to hunt these animals,\n        they will also have to obtain a \u201ctake\u201d permit (Form 3-200-37). Id. \u00b6 5. The take\n        permit is valid for one year, but may be renewed annually. Id.\n\nSCI Opp. Mem. at 29-30 (footnotes omitted). 13\n\n        Notwithstanding the availability of this permitting process, the plaintiffs argue that the\n\nirreparable harm facing its members cannot be avoided by obtaining permits. SCI argues, for\n\nexample, that \u201c[t]he permits will not restore the value of these animals, nor will they rejuvenate the\n\nmarket for surplus animals. Permits in the hands of Safari Club members will not reverse the fact\n\nthat numerous ranchers and breeders have chosen not to continue to maintain their herds and that\n\nthere will be fewer herds, fewer animals and fewer opportunities to hunt and conserve these\n\nantelope.\u201d SCI Mem. at 40. The EWA plaintiffs also warn that the permitting requirements that will\n\n13\n  Indeed, a number of ranchers have applied for permits to engage in interstate commerce and the take of these animals.\nAccording to the FWS, of the 62 applications received since January 17, 2012, the FWS has granted 26 permits for\nthese activities, denied none and have the remaining under review. Defs.\u2019 Statement on the Effects of the Rescission\nRule, ECF No. 55, at 4. The Federal Defendants point out that \u201conly one of the Plaintiffs has chosen to apply.\u201d Id.\n                                                          28\n\fbe in effect after April 4, 2012 are potentially dangerous to the future of the Three Antelope species.\n\nThey reference, for example, the decline of a closely-related species, the Arabian Oryx. \u201cListed as\n\nan endangered species in the 1970\u2019s, the Arabian oryx has long been subject to the same permitting\n\nrequirements and restrictions that will be imposed by the [F]inal [R]ule. There were more than\n\n1,500 Arabian oryx in the United States when they were listed; today, there are less than 250.\u201d\n\nEWA Mem. at 42. Similarly, the EWA plaintiffs invoke the fate of the Barasingha Deer to warn the\n\nCourt of the possible effects of a permitting requirement for ranchers. As one of the plaintiffs\n\nexplains, \u201c[b]ecause these Barasingha Deer were subject to the permitting requirements as soon as\n\nthey were listed, we have to get a time consuming government permit and annual government\n\napproval to harvest a Barasingha for meat, trophy or cull . . . Since no one will buy them, and we no\n\nlonger want them on our place, we were told by the government that our only option is to separate\n\nthe males and females and let them attrite away.\u201d EWA Mem. at 3 (quoting Nancy Green Decl.,\n\nCase No. 12-cv-00340, Ex. I, \u00b6 2). The plaintiffs argue that requiring ranchers to seek permits to\n\ncontinue working with the Three Antelope species will similarly lead to the decline of the captive-\n\nbred Three Antelope species.\n\n       The plaintiffs engage in a certain level of hyperbole in describing what will happen to\n\nranchers holding members of the Three Antelope species upon the effective date of the Final Rule.\n\nThe EWA plaintiffs state, for example, that \u201cwhen the FWS permit requirement goes into effect,\n\nExotic Wildlife Ranchers\u2019 raising herds of the three antelope species without a permit becomes\n\nillegal, subjecting them to civil and criminal penalties under the Endangered Species Act.\u201d EWA\n\nMem. on Penalties of ESA that Become Effective April 4, 2012, ECF No. 56, at 2. SCI asserts that\n\n\u201cRanchers/owners cannot even segregate their males from females to prevent further breeding as\n\nthis is an activity that likely qualifies as a \u2018taking\u2019 which is prohibited by regulation under the\n\nEndangered Species Act.\u201d SCI Notice of Information Regarding Permit Implications, ECF No. 57,\n\n\n                                                   29\n\fat 1-2. In response to the Court\u2019s request 14 for supplemental information to clarify the ranching\n\nactivities that would be prohibited by the ESA without a permit upon the effective date of the Final\n\nRule, the FWS made amply clear that these predictions are incorrect. After the Final Rule becomes\n\neffective, ranchers \u201cmay continue to possess these animals, transport them within a State, or sell\n\nthem to another party in the same State.\u201d Fed. Defs.\u2019 Statement on the Effects of the Rescission\n\nRule, ECF No. 55, at 3. The Federal Defendants further state that \u201cContrary to the claims of\n\nopposing counsel, even if the Plaintiffs do not obtain the necessary permits, the Rescission Rule will\n\nnot render it illegal to possess these antelope, to hold them captive, or to enclose them within a\n\nfence. The Plaintiffs may also engage in generally accepted animal husbandry practices, breeding\n\nprocedures, and veterinary care of these captive endangered species.\u201d Id. Plaintiffs will still be able\n\nto cull and hunt the animals after the Final Rule becomes effective, \u201cif they obtain the required\n\npermits.\u201d Id. at 3-4.\n\n           The Court does not find the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions about irreparable harm sufficiently\n\npersuasive to grant the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief. The FWS has\n\nprovided a viable permitting process through which ranchers and other interested parties could have\n\nsought permits to continue their activities related to the Three Antelope species for the duration of\n\nthese lawsuits. Many ranchers have already availed themselves of this process and obtained\n\npermits. See note 13, supra. The plaintiffs\u2019 failure to do so \u2013 or lack of interest in maintaining\n\nthese animals if permitting requirements are in place \u2013 does not constitute a reason for this Court to\n\ngrant them the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief from a Final Rule, which the plaintiffs have\n\nknown is going into effect at least since it was announced in early January of 2012. By applying for\n\npermits, the plaintiffs and other interested parties could have protected their interest in continuing\n\nwith their activities with the Three Antelope species for the duration of this lawsuit. See, e.g., Decl.\n\n\n14\n     The Court made this request during a telephonic conference with the parties on April 2, 2012.\n                                                             30\n\fof Timothy Mark Terry, Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No. 26, Ex.

DD, at \u00b6 15 (\u201cI made some inquiries\n\nabout applying for the Captive Bred Wildlife Registration program, but decided not to participate\u201d).\n\nIt is \u201cwell-settled that a preliminary injunction movant does not satisfy the irreparable harm\n\ncriterion when the alleged harm is self-inflicted.\u201d Lee v. Christian Coal. of America, Inc., 160 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 14, 33 (D.D.C. 2001) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In analogous circumstances, plaintiffs who decline the opportunity to avail themselves of a\n\nregulatory scheme to avoid the very harm for which they seek injunctive relief have been denied the\n\nrelief. For example, in Second City Music, Inc. v. City of Chicago, 333 F.3d 846, 847 (7th Cir.\n\n2003), relied upon by the Federal Defendants, the plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction to\n\nprevent the City from applying to established businesses an ordinance requiring dealers in used\n\naudio and video equipment to obtain licenses to sell the merchandise. The Seventh Circuit found\n\nthe plaintiff \u201cwould incur no detriment by the act of applying\u201d for the license, and rejected the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s contention that it would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction. Id. at 849. In the\n\nCourt\u2019s view, if the plaintiff went out of business, such injury would be self-inflicted because the\n\nplaintiff could have avoided that injury by simply applying for a license. Id. at 850. Rather than\n\nenjoin the ordinance, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the \u201csensible way to proceed is for [the\n\nplaintiff] to obtain a license and continue to operate while it builds a record.\u201d Id.\n\n       More recently in this jurisdiction, the court in National Mining Association v. Jackson, 768\n\nF. Supp. 2d 34 (D.D.C. 2011), denied the plaintiff mining association\u2019s request for injunctive relief\n\nto prevent imposition of additional permitting conditions required by the Environmental Protection\n\nAgency. These conditions \u201ccreat[ed] a new level of review by the EPA and an alternate permitting\n\npathway not contemplated by the current regulatory structure.\u201d Id. at 40 (citation omitted). In the\n\n\n                                                   31\n\fface of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that its members were likely to incur substantial economic losses as a\n\nresult of the permitting change, the court found the plaintiff had not shown that the losses \u201cwould\n\nthreaten the survival of the business\u201d or were \u201cimminent or certain,\u201d since the plaintiff had \u201cnot\n\ndemonstrated how or why these losses cannot ultimately be recovered if and when the mining\n\nprojects in question are permitted to proceed.\u201d Id. at 53-54 & n.13. Accord Sociedad Anonima\n\nVina Santa Rita v. United States Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, 193 F. Supp. 2d 6, 26 (D.D.C. 2001) (court\n\ndenied requested injunctive relief to suspend effective date of agency\u2019s final rule designating area as\n\nan American viticultural area where plaintiff failed to show irreparable injury since plaintiff could\n\npetition agency for alternative name and \u201c[q]uite simply, if Plaintiff provides the ATF with\n\nevidence . . . and if Plaintiff offers a viable alternative name, the [agency] may meaningfully alter\n\nthe challenged final rule and thereby avert the harm . . . Plaintiff anticipates.\u201d).\n\n        SCI disputes the idea that the harm could possibly be \u201cself-inflicted\u201d and argues that a\n\n\u201cblind reliance on process completely ignores\u201d market forces that are at play \u201cthat are totally\n\noutside the control of Safari Club and its members.\u201d SCI Reply at 2. SCI argues, for example, that\n\n\u201c[t]he announcement of permits and federal regulation required by the enforcement of endangered\n\nstatus for these populations affected the market for these animals and undermined the incentive for\n\ncontinued conservation.\u201d Id. \u201cThe result,\u201d SCI argues, \u201cis fewer breeders, fewer animals,\n\ndepressed value and a stark reversal of the conservation achievements won through a free market\n\nand sustainable use conservation.\u201d Id.     Similarly, the EWA plaintiffs note that FWS\u2019 permit\n\nsystem was designed for zoos and wildlife preserves and that the permit system \u201crobs the Exotic\n\nWildlife Ranchers of the economic incentive \u2013 destroying the private captive breeding system that\n\nhas saved these three African antelope species from extinction.\u201d EWA Reply at 6.\n\n        This kind of market harm, however, even where it impacts the fate of the animals, is just not\n\nsufficient to warrant preliminary injunctive relief, especially where the status of the Three Antelope\n\n\n                                                    32\n\fspecies as endangered species has been a topic of debate over a period of many years and where\n\nranchers had the opportunity to seek permits to alleviate at least temporarily some of the forces of\n\nthe market that were outside of their control. Even if the FWS \u201cgrossly underestimates the burdens\n\nof its regulatory permitting requirements for these ranchers,\u201d see EWA Reply at 15, a burdensome\n\npermitting system to take or hunt an animal listed as an \u201cendangered species\u201d is not sufficient\n\njustification for a preliminary injunction in this case. SCI has not demonstrated irreparable harm to\n\nwarrant preliminary injunctive relief.\n\n   3.      Plaintiffs Do Not Establish That The Balance Of Equities Tips In Their Favor\n\n        SCI points out that the Federal Defendants and SCI \u201cactually agree that the balance of\n\ninterests, including public interest, must tilt in favor of protected species.\u201d SCI Reply at 23.\n\nSimilarly, the EWA plaintiffs note that \u201c[a] preliminary injunction, pending resolution of the validity\n\nof the FWS\u2019s new permit rule, helps the species \u2013 and so aids, not injures, FWS.\u201d EWA Mem. at\n\n43. The Federal Defendants and the plaintiffs of course disagree on what \u201chelping the species\u201d\n\nmeans. While the FWS stands behind its decision to implement the Final Rule, SCI, for example,\n\nargues, instead, that the \u201cbest medicine for three antelope conservation would be to return to a free,\n\nunrestricted trade system and let the ranching and hunting community restore their extremely\n\nsuccessful private conservation system.\u201d SCI Reply at 24. SCI argues that it seeks only to\n\n\u201cmaintain the status quo\u201d and that the government\u2019s \u201cpotential harm from a grant of preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief would be minimal if not non-existent.\u201d SCI Mem. at 41. The Federal Defendants\n\ncounter that SCI is seeking more than maintenance of the \u201cstatus quo,\u201d and that, by seeking to\n\nenjoin enforcement of endangered status for the U.S. captive members of the Three Antelope\n\nspecies, SCI is actually arguing that \u201cabsolutely zero protections would apply to these animals.\u201d\n\nSCI Opp. Mem. at 36.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   33\n\f        The Court concludes that the balance of equities tips towards the FWS here given its\n\nCongressionally mandated role of protecting endangered species. American Rivers v. U.S. Army\n\nCorp of Engineers, 271 F. Supp. 2d 230, 261 (D.D.C. 2003) (\u201cCongress\u2019 enactment of the ESA\n\nclearly indicates that the balance of interests \u2018weighs heavily in favor of protected species.\u2019\u201d)\n\n(quoting Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Burlington N. R.R., 23 F.3d 1508, 1510 (9th Cir. 1994)) (emphasis\n\nin original). The Court sees no reason to entrust the interest of endangered species to private\n\nranchers, when Congress has already delegated that authority elsewhere. The plaintiffs have not\n\nshown that the balance of equities tips in their favor.\n\n   4.      Plaintiffs Do Not Establish That The Public Interest Will Be Served By The\n           Requested Injunctive Relief\n\n        Similarly to the discussion concerning the balance of harms, the Federal Defendants and\n\nplaintiffs disagree over whether the public interest in conservation of the Three Antelope Species\n\nwould be more or less served by enforcement of the ESA and the Final Rule against U.S. captive\n\nherds of these animals. According to SCI, its requested \u201cstay of endangered status enforcement will\n\nrestore incentives for private ranchers to continue, recommence or even initiate breeding operations\n\nfor the three species, and will rejuvenate the market for surplus animals,\u201d thereby \u201crestor[ing] the\n\nsystem by which the species\u2019 conservation has long been achieved through sustainable use.\u201d SCI\n\nMem. at 42-43. Likewise, the EWA plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule \u201cthreatens to extinguish\n\nboth\u201d the Three Antelope species and the $1.3 billion exotic wildlife ranching industry, with an\n\nassociated 14,000 jobs, and that, therefore, the public interest favors issuance of injunctive relief\n\nstaying enforcement of the Final Rule \u201cto conserve these endangered antelope.\u201d EWA Mem. at 44.\n\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture, which the Court permitted to file an amicus brief, expresses\n\nits view in stark terms that \u201cthe Final Rule will kill the sport of hunting these animals, which in turn\n\nwill kill the industry of breeding and raising these animals, which in turn will kill, through\n\nregulation, the three species of Antelope made the subject of this suit, leading to their inevitable\n                                                   34\n\fextinction.\u201d Amicus Curiae Brief of the Texas Department of Agriculture in Supp. of Pls.\u2019 Mot. for\n\nPrelim. Inj., Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No. 52, at 4.\n\n       The FWS does not dispute the contributions of private ranching to the conservation of the\n\nThree Antelope species, nor the economic benefits to ranchers and others of the current regulatory\n\nscheme. Instead, the FWS points out that the Final Rule, although eliminating the Captive-bred\n\nExemption, would permit continued handling of the animals, including culling and sport hunting.\n\nSee Decl. Van Norman, Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No. 35, Ex. 1, \u00b6 3 (\u201cRegistration under the\n\nCBW program also allows a facility to cull animals in its herd to maintain a viable and healthy\n\nherd.\u201d); \u00b6 5 (\u201cIn order to allow outside hunters to come on to a ranch to hunt animals, the facility\n\nmust obtain an interstate commerce/take permit . . . Through the permit process, the ranch would\n\nidentify the number of animals that would likely be culled to maintain a healthy population over a\n\none-year period [and] [i]f the application were approved, . . . a single permit . . . would authorize all\n\napproved activities for a one-year period. This single permit would allow the facility to advertise all\n\nproposed hunts being anticipated during the one-year period to facilitate herd management, since\n\nmost advertisements would be considered interstate commerce, and it would authorize individuals\n\nother than employees of the facility to lethally take listed specimens.\u201d).\n\n       The FWS identifies two ways in which the public interest would be disserved if the\n\nrequested relief were granted. First, the relief requested by SCI would result in the wholesale de-\n\nregulation of any domestic activity regarding these animals, eliminating even the regulation in\n\neffect under the Captive-bred Exemption. The FWS explains that SCI seeks \u201cabsolutely zero\n\nprotections [to] apply to these animals\u201d so that \u201cranchers or other holders of these animals could do\n\nanything they wanted with these animals \u2013 move them in interstate or foreign commerce, or even\n\nallow lethal take,\u201d without having to comply with current regulatory requirements, let alone the\n\npermitting requirements that become effective with the Final Rule. SCI Opp. Mem. at 36.\n\n\n                                                   35\n\fSpecifically, under the current Captive-bred Exemption, the Three Antelope species must be\n\nhandled in a \u201cmanner that contributes to increasing or sustaining captive numbers or to potential\n\nreintroduction to range countries.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.21(h)(1); see also id. \u00a7 17.21(h)(3)-(8)\n\n(additional restrictions including prevention of hybridization, maintenance of genetic diversity,\n\netc.). See SCI Opp. Mem. at 36. The FWS cautions that \u201callowing unregulated trade in the captive\n\nU.S. animals would undermine the conservation of the[se] species in the wild,\u201d id. at 37, by making\n\nit more difficult to enforce the ESA and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered\n\nSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora (\u201cCITES\u201d), which prohibits the import, export, trade and\n\npossession of species listed under the Convention, including the Three Antelope species. Id.; Van\n\nNorman Decl., Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No. 35, Ex. 1, \u00b6 12. Even accepting as entirely valid\n\nthe success under the current regulatory framework of private ranching in the conservation of the\n\nThree Antelope species, the Court cannot ignore the risk of the harms to these endangered species\n\nidentified by the FWS from elimination of all regulation of the Three Antelope species.\n\n       Moreover, the Court is cognizant that to effectuate the over-arching goal of the ESA to\n\nconserve endangered species, the law expressly requires the FWS to publish in the Federal Register\n\nnotice, with a 30 day comment period, of applications for permits to handle listed species in a\n\nmanner otherwise contrary to the law. Friends of Animals v. Salazar, 626 F. Supp. 2d at 106 (citing\n\n16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1539(c)). This provision provides a mechanism for \u201cmeaningful public participation\u201d\n\nand an opportunity for the public \u201cto monitor whether hunting ranches actually fulfill the purposes\n\nof the ESA . . . .\u201d Id. at 117-18. Since promulgation of the Captive-bred Exemption in 2005, this\n\nmechanism has been subverted and the public has been \u201cshut out,\u201d id. at 118, because the\n\nexemption allows holders of the Three Antelope species to engage in otherwise prohibited activities\n\nwithout a case-by-case review of each permit application. Granting the relief requested by the EWA\n\nplaintiffs to enjoin enforcement of the Final Rule, even though this request is more narrow than the\n\n\n                                                  36\n\frelief sought by SCI, would persist in denying the public that information which the ESA requires to\n\nbe made public under an exemption found to be unlawful almost three years ago. This is a\n\ndisservice to the public interest that weighs against grant of the requested injunctive relief.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons explained above, the Court denies the Motions for Preliminary Injunctions\n\nof SCI and the EWA plaintiffs. An appropriate Order will accompany this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\nDATED: April 3, 2012\n                                                               /s/ Beryl A.

Salazar, et al., Case No. 11-cv-01564 (\u201cSCI Action\u201d), ECF\n\nNo. 26, and the other filed by the plaintiffs in Exotic Wildlife Association, et al. v. United States\n\n\n                                                    1\n\fDepartment of the Interior, et al., Case No. 12-cv-00340, ECF No. 3 (\u201cEWA Action\u201d). 1 The\n\nplaintiffs seek different injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiff in the SCI Action seeks to enjoin\n\nenforcement of endangered species status for U.S. non-native captive populations of three antelope\n\nspecies \u2013 the scimitar-horned oryx, dama gazelle, and addax (\u201cThree Antelope species\u201d), while the\n\nplaintiffs in the EWA Action are seeking more narrow relief to enjoin enforcement of a Final Rule\n\npromulgated by the Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d) that goes into effect on April 4, 2012\n\n(\u201cFinal Rule\u201d). The Final Rule would remove a regulation that has, since 2005, exempted U.S. non-\n\nnative captive populations of the Three Antelope species from many of the prohibitions, restrictions,\n\nand requirements attendant to their classification as endangered species. Since the exemption\n\nregulation was issued at the same time the Three Antelope species were listed as endangered in\n\n2005, the removal of the 2005 exemption would, for the first time, allow for full enforcement of\n\nendangered species status of the Three Antelope species. For the reasons explained below, the two\n\npending Motions for a Preliminary Injunction are denied. 2\n\nI.       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n         A.       Endangered Species Act, Fish and Wildlife Service, and The National\n                  Environmental Policy Act\n\n         The Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) was enacted by Congress in 1973 \u201cto provide a means\n\n\n1\n  It is helpful to understand the procedural background of this case before delving into the pending motions. The SCI\nand EWA Actions have been consolidated, along with Owen, et al. v. United States Department of the Interior, et al.,\nCase No. 12-cv-00194 (\u201cOwen Action\u201d). The Owen and EWA Actions were reassigned as related cases to the presiding\njudge on February 10 and March 14, 2012, respectively. Each of the three consolidated actions is against Ken Salazar,\nin his official capacity as Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d);\nand Daniel Ashe, in his official capacity as Director of the FWS. The U.S. Department of the Interior is also a\ndefendant in Case Nos. 12-cv-00194 and 12-cv-00340. (The Court refers to the defendants collectively as \u201cFederal\nDefendants\u201d). On March 23, 2012, this Court granted the Motions to Intervene by two organizations, Friends of\nAnimals (\u201cFOA\u201d) and Defenders of Wildlife (\u201cDOW\u201d) (collectively, \u201cdefendant-intervenors\u201d). See Order, Case No.\n11-cv-01564, ECF No. 42.\n2\n  The plaintiffs have requested a hearing on their motions for injunctive relief. See Letter from SCI counsel, dated\nMarch 23, 2012, ECF No. 44-5; EWA Reply in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\u201cEWA Reply\u201d), ECF No. 40 at 20. The\nCourt finds, however, that \u201cthe record is sufficient to demonstrate a lack of right to relief\u201d without the need for a\nhearing. Smith v.

The CBW\n\nregulation provides that \u201cany person may take; export or re-import; deliver, receive, carry, transport\n\nor ship in interstate or foreign commerce, in the course of a commercial activity; or sell or offer for\n\nsale in interstate or foreign commerce any endangered wildlife that is bred in captivity in the United\n\nStates provided . . . that\u201d a number of conditions are met, including that the \u201cpurpose of such\n\nactivity is to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species.\u201d 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.21(g)(1).\n\nThe FWS has also set forth regulations for application for individual permits authorizing \u201ctake\u201d that\n\n\u201cis incidental to, and not the purpose of, the carrying out of an otherwise lawful activity,\u201d see 16\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1539(a)(1)(B), or \u201cfor scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or survival of the\n\naffected species,\u201d see 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1539(a)(1)(A).\n\n       The National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d) is a statute that, inter alia, requires\n\npreparation of an environmental impact statement in \u201cevery recommendation or report on proposals\n\nfor legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human\n\nenvironment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C).\n\n       B.      Three Antelope Species\n\n       This case concerns three antelope species, the scimitar-horned oryx, dama gazelle, and\n\naddax (\u201cThree Antelope species\u201d) living on private ranches in the United States. The Three\n\nAntelope species are native to the African continent. See 70 Fed. Reg. 52,310 (Sept. 2, 2005). The\n\nthree animal species at the center of this dispute are briefly described below:\n\n       The scimitar-horned oryx stands about 47 inches [in, 119 centimeters (cm)] tall and\n       weighs around 450 pounds [lb, 204 kilograms (kg)]. It is generally pale in color, but\n       the neck and chest are dark reddish brown. As the name suggests, adult animals\n       possess a pair of horns curving back in an arc up to 50 in (127 cm) long. The\n                                                    4\n\f       scimitar-horned oryx once had an extensive range in North Africa throughout the\n       semi-deserts and steppes north of the Sahara, from Morocco to Egypt.\n\n       The addax stands about 42 in (106 cm) tall at the shoulder and weighs around 220 lb\n       (100 kg). It is grayish white and its horns twist in a spiral up to 43 in (109 cm) long.\n       The addax once occurred throughout the deserts and sub-deserts of North Africa,\n       from the Atlantic Ocean to the Nile River.\n\n       The dama gazelle stands about 39 in (99 cm) tall at the shoulder and weighs around\n       160 lb (72 kg). The upper part of its body is mostly reddish brown, whereas the head,\n       rump, and underparts are white. Its horns curve back and up, but reach a length of\n       only about 17 in (43 cm) long. The dama gazelle, the largest of the gazelles, was\n       once common and widespread in arid and semi-arid regions of the Sahara.\n\n70 Fed. Reg. 52,319 (Sept. 2, 2005). Wild populations of the addax and dama gazelle still exist in\n\nAfrica, while the scimitar-horned oryx is thought to have disappeared from the wild. See SCI Mem.\n\nin Support of Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. (\u201cSCI Mem.\u201d) at 2.\n\n       Captive populations of the Three Antelope species exist in the United States and other parts\n\nof the world, including on the ranches of some of the plaintiffs in this consolidated case. SCI\n\nargues that \u201ccaptive populations are growing and thriving\u201d in the United States, see SCI Mem. at 4,\n\nor were until announcement of the Final Rule going into effect on April 4, 2012. The EWA\n\nplaintiffs argue, too, that the Three Antelope species have \u201cthrived\u201d thanks to \u201ca few foresighted\n\nlivestock ranchers\u201d who decided to collect and breed the Three Antelope species.

Addax and dama gazelle occur in very low\n       numbers in the wild, and a significant percentage of remaining specimens survive\n       only in captivity (71% and 48%, respectively). Captive-breeding programs operated\n       by zoos and private ranches have effectively increased the numbers of these animals\n       while genetically managing their herds . . . Threats that have reduced these species\u2019\n       numbers to current levels in the wild continue throughout most of the historic range.\n       As future opportunities arise for reintroduction in the antelope range countries,\n       captive-breeding programs will be able to provide genetically diverse and otherwise\n       suitable specimens.\n\n70 Fed. Reg. 52,310-52,311 (Sept. 2, 2005) (internal citation omitted).\n\n       C.      Safari Club International and Exotic Wildlife Association\n\n       The plaintiffs bringing the Motions for Preliminary Injunctions are two private associations\n\nbased in the United States. SCI is a non-profit organization with 53,000 members worldwide. SCI\n\nMem. at 19.

EWA is an association of ranchers who own the majority of Texas\u2019 exotic wildlife,\n\nwhich they raise on private property. EWA Mem. at 6.\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that private conservation and herding of the Three Antelope species has\n\nbeen helpful for increasing the population of these animals. SCI, for example, argues that \u201c[i]n the\n\nU.S., private conservation, free trade, and the ability to hunt these animals have succeeded in\n\nestablishing large, healthy U.S. populations of each of these species.\u201d SCI Mem. at 2.\n\n       D.      Overview of the Consolidated Cases\n\n       The FWS Final Rule scheduled to go into effect on April 4, 2012 has a history reaching back\n\nmore than two decades. In 1991, the FWS published a proposed rule to list as endangered species\n\nunder the Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d) three antelope species, namely, the scimitar-horned\n\noryx, dama gazelle, and addax. See 56 Fed. Reg. 56,491 (Nov. 5, 1991). The FWS opened\n\ncomment periods on this proposed rule on June 8, 1992 (57 Fed. Reg. 24,220), July 24, 2003 (68\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fFed. Reg. 43,706), and November 26, 2003 (68 Fed. Reg. 66,395). According to the Federal\n\nDefendants, \u201c[f]rom the outset of the rulemaking process, the [FWS] announced that it was\n\nconsidering a separate regulatory scheme to cover captive-held individuals of [the Three Antelope\n\nspecies] outside the species\u2019 natural ranges.\u201d SCI Opp. Mem. at 7 (citing 56 Fed. Reg. at 56,491,\n\n56,492, 56,494 & 68 Fed. Reg. at 43,707). No further action was taken on the introduction of this\n\nproposed rule until February 1, 2005, when the FWS proposed a separate regulatory scheme for\n\ncaptive-bred species. See 70 Fed. Reg. 5117.\n\n       Subsequently, on September 2, 2005, the FWS listed the Three Antelope species as\n\nendangered under the ESA, after finding that the Three Antelope species faced extinction because\n\nof all of the endangered species listing factors other than \u201cdisease or predation.\u201d SCI Opp. Mem. at\n\n8; 70 Fed. Reg. at 52,321-52,322 (Sept. 2, 2005) (\u201cListing Decision\u201d). At the same time, the FWS\n\nadded a new regulation, codified at 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.21(h), authorizing certain otherwise prohibited\n\nactivities for U.S. captive-bred individuals of the Three Antelope species (\u201cCaptive-bred\n\nExemption\u201d). See 70 Fed. Reg. 52,319-52,320 (Sept. 2, 2005). The FWS noted at that time that\n\n\u201c[c]aptive-breeding programs operated by zoos and private ranches have effectively increased the\n\nnumbers of these animals while genetically managing their herds. As future opportunities arise for\n\nreintroduction in the antelope range countries, captive-breeding programs will be able to provide\n\ngenetically diverse and otherwise suitable specimens. Currently, however, continued habitat loss\n\nand wonton killing have made reintroduction [of captive-bred herds to the wild] nonviable in most\n\ncases.\u201d 70 Fed. Reg. at 52,322 (Sept. 2, 2005).\n\n       Animals rights groups, including the defendant-intervenors, subsequently and successfully\n\nfiled suit alleging that the FWS unlawfully promulgated the Captive-bred Exemption.

Id.\n\nat 116, 118. The court remanded the rule to the FWS for further proceedings.\n\n           In 2010, both SCI and the Owen plaintiffs petitioned the FWS to delist from the endangered\n\nspecies list the U.S. captive-bred herds of the Three Antelope species. See SCI Action, ECF No. 1,\n\nSCI Compl. \u00b6 10; Owen Action, ECF No. 1, Owen Compl. at 2.

This would eliminate the exclusion for the\n\nThree Antelope species from certain prohibitions in the ESA and require any person intending to\n\nengage in otherwise prohibited activity to qualify for an exemption or obtain a permit authorizing\n\nsuch activity. The FWS opened the proposed rule for a 30-day comment period in which it received\n\n93 individual comments, 2 from state agencies, 8 from nongovernment groups, and 86 from\n\n\n4\n    All references to ECF numbers are references to Case No. 11-cv-01564 unless otherwise noted.\n                                                            8\n\findividuals, most of whom were ranchers or individuals associated with ranches. The vast majority\n\nof the comments opposed the proposed regulation. See 77 Fed Reg. 431, 432 (Jan. 5, 2012).\n\n        The SCI Action was then filed in this district on August 31, 2011, alleging that the Federal\n\nDefendants violated the ESA and Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by including U.S. captive-\n\nbred herds of the Three Antelope species in the 2005 listing determination, failing to remove U.S.\n\ncaptive herds from endangered species status after Judge Kennedy\u2019s ruling, and failing to respond in\n\na timely manner to SCI\u2019s petition for delisting. See SCI Action, ECF No. 1, SCI Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10.\n\nLikewise, the Owen Action, which was filed in the Northern District of Texas in October, 2011,\n\nalleges that the FWS violated the ESA and the APA by failing to respond to the EWA\u2019s petition for\n\ndelisting. See Owen Action, ECF No. 1, Owen Compl. at 2. Following transfer of the Owen Action\n\nto this jurisdiction, this Court consolidated the SCI Action with the Owen Action. See Case No. 11-\n\ncv-01564, Minute Order (Feb. 21, 2012). 5\n\n        On January 5, 2012, FWS issued its final rule removing the Captive-bred Exemption,\n\neffective on April 4, 2012 (\u201cFinal Rule\u201d). 77 Fed.

DISCUSSION\n\n       In filing their Motions for Injunctive Relief, the plaintiffs are asking this Court to evaluate\n\nthe chance of their success on the merits of their claims in order to decide whether they should be\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fawarded the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief. In this consolidated case, the plaintiffs\u2019\n\nchance of success on the merits must be evaluated separately as the plaintiffs are challenging\n\ndifferent rules in their Complaints and thus relying on different administrative records. The Court\n\nfinds that neither SCI\u2019s challenge to the 2005 Listing Decision, nor the EWA plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to\n\nthe 2012 Final Rule appears at this stage to have a likelihood of success on the merits. 6 Nor have\n\nthe plaintiffs carried their heavy burden of demonstrating irreparable harm in the absence of\n\npreliminary relief, nor that the balance of equities tip in their favor. Finally, the plaintiffs have not\n\ncarried their burden of showing that injunctive relief is truly in the public interest. The Court\n\ndiscusses each of these factors seriatim below. 7\n\n    1.        Plaintiffs Do Not Establish A Likelihood Of Success On The Merits\n\n              a. SCI Action\n\n         SCI filed its lawsuit in order to challenge the FWS decision, over six years ago, in 2005, to\n\nlist the non-native, captive members of the Three Antelope species as endangered species. SCI\n\nargues in support of its Motion for a Preliminary Injunction that the FWS (1) \u201cacted arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously and in a manner inconsistent with ongoing agency decision-making made for other\n\nsimilarly situated species\u201d and (2) \u201cignored the conservation mandates of the ESA and the fact that\n6\n The Court notes that the arguments considered here regarding the merits of the claims may be supplemented once\nbriefing is complete on the pending motions for summary judgment. Even if these other arguments would persuade the\nCourt on the merits, the plaintiffs would still not meet the other criteria required for preliminary injunctive relief, as\nexplained below.\n7\n  As an initial matter, the Court finds that the plaintiffs have standing to seek relief, which is unchallenged by the\nFederal Defendants. \u201c[T]he requirement that a claimant have \u2018standing is an essential and unchanging part of the case-\nor-controversy requirement of Article III.\u2019\u201d Davis v.

The Federal Defendants argue that SCI is unlikely to\n\nsucceed on the merits for three reasons: (1) SCI has not shown that the FWS \u201chas a policy of\n\nexcluding animals held in captivity when listing a foreign species;\u201d (2) SCI \u201chas failed to show that\n\n[FWS] was required to designate captive members of the Three Antelope species in the United\n\nStates as a distinct population;\u201d and (3) SCI \u201chas not shown that the Listing Rule is inconsistent\n\nwith the conservation purpose of the ESA.\u201d SCI Opp. Mem. at 13-14. The Court concludes that\n\nSCI has not established a likelihood of success on the merits because SCI has not shown that the\n\nFWS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in deciding to list the Three Antelope species as endangered.\n\nAs the Court explains, the Listing Decision (1) was issued only after years of consultation and\n\nresearch, and appears to be consistent (2) with the policy and practice of the FWS as well as (3)\n\nwith the purpose of the ESA.\n\n               i.       The FWS Decision to List the Three Antelope Species As Endangered\n                        Was the Result of Many Years of Consultation and Research\n\n       The FWS decision to list the Three Antelope species was reached only after a period of\n\nmany years of research and consultation. Indeed, SCI acknowledges that the FWS devoted\n\nsignificant time over many years to developing its policies with respect to the Three Antelope\n\nspecies. SCI references FWS\u2019 \u201cprotracted deliberation over the listing status of the three species,\u201d\n\nsee SCI Mem. at 5, and the \u201c14 years that [FWS] collected data and analyzed its legal strategies for\n\ndealing with the thriving and growing U.S captive population.\u201d SCI Mem. at 8. SCI notes, for\n\nexample, that the FWS \u201cwas well aware that it had listing options that would allow the [FWS] to\n\nexclude those U.S. non-native captive members from the endangered classification of the animals in\n\nthe wild . . . .\u201d Id. The FWS also \u201cdrafted early versions of the Antelope Listing Rule, relying on\n\nits authority to treat the U.S. non-native captive populations differently than the populations in the\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fwild.\u201d Id. at 9. The FWS approach thus seems to have been a thorough one, in which the FWS\n\ncomprehensively reviewed the possible ways in which to regulate the Three Antelope species.\n\n                  ii.      The FWS Decision to List the Three Antelope Species As Endangered\n                           Was Consistent with FWS Policy and Practice\n\n         SCI argues that the FWS \u201cacted arbitrarily and capriciously and in a manner inconsistent\n\nwith ongoing agency decision-making made for other similarly situated species.\u201d SCI Mem. at 22.\n\n\u201cIn its consideration of other captive and/or non-native populations of species that . . . had no direct\n\nconnection with the conservation of the species in the wild, the [FWS] . . . dealt separately with\n\nthose captive and/or non-native populations and in some cases had not listed them at all.\u201d 8 Id. at 25.\n\nThe FWS decision not to make separate listing decisions for wild populations and captive\n\npopulations of the Three Antelope species when it has done so in other cases, however, does not\n\nmean that the FWS listing decision was arbitrary and capricious. SCI cites in particular four\n\nexamples where the FWS purportedly decided to treat captive animals differently than their wild\n\ncounterparts. SCI Mem. at 26-30 (discussing listing decisions for Nile Crocodile, the Chimpanzee,\n\nthe Arkansas River Shiner, and the Arctic Grayling). The FWS, for example, classified \u201cranched\n\npopulations\u201d of the Nile Crocodile as \u201cthreatened\u201d while it left other populations of the species\n\nclassified as \u201cendangered.\u201d SCI Mem. at 26; see Reclassification of Ranched Nile Crocodile\n\nPopulations in Zimbabwe From Endangered to Threatened, 52 Fed.

The Court disagrees. To the extent that this issue was not raised during the\ncomment period, that is understandable because the FWS itself was contemplating creating a different rule for animals\nheld in captivity versus animals held in the wild. See, e.g, Proposed Endangered Status for Scimitar-horned Oryx,\nAddax, and Dama Gazelle, 56 Fed. Reg. 56,491 (Nov. 5, 1991) (\u201cCaptive and free-roaming groups, outside of the\nnatural ranges of the species, may be covered separately from natural populations in any final rule.\u201d).

SCI argues, therefore, that the FWS\n\ndecision not to differentiate between wild and captive antelope when listing the Three Antelope\n\nSpecies was inconsistent. \u201cInconsistency, without an explanation,\u201d SCI argues, \u201cqualifies as\n\narbitrary and capricious agency action.\u201d SCI Reply in Support of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\u201cSCI\n\nReply\u201d) at 1.\n\n         The Court disagrees. SCI\u2019s arguments fail because the treatment of the wild and captive\n\nanimals in their examples are just that\u2014examples. The plaintiffs have pointed to no evidence\n\nsuggesting that differentiating between wild and captive animals in listing decisions is a policy of\n\nthe FWS, nor that any policy was abrogated when the FWS decided not to differentiate between\n\nwild and captive animal populations when listing the Three Antelope species as endangered. In\n\nfact, the Federal Defendants note that the examples cited by SCI are \u201cfour isolated listing decisions\n\nout of thousands that the [FWS] has made since Congress enacted the ESA in 1973.\u201d SCI Opp.\n\nMem. at 14. An agency decision to treat the wild and captive antelope together in the Listing\n\nDecision came only after consideration over the period from 1991 to 2005. The fact that the FWS\n\nhas over time differentiated between wild and captive animals in the case of other animal species\n\ndoes not, on its own, suggest to the Court that the decision not to do so in this case was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious. 9\n\n         Indeed, the examples cited by SCI are not even necessarily analogous to the Three Antelope\n\nspecies in captivity. The Federal Defendants point out that two of the examples cited by SCI (the\n\nArkansas River Shiner and the Arctic Grayling) do not even involve \u201ccaptive\u201d populations, see SCI\n\n9\n  SCI argues that \u201c[t]he issue is not whether the FWS had any sort of policy to deal with inclusion or exclusion of non-\nnative captive members of a species for the purposes of listing. The point is that the [FWS] had, on other occasions,\nfollowed a practice of disparately classifying captive and wild populations. When the FWS addressed the three antelope\nspecies, it claimed that it could not treat captive populations differently and yet failed to explain the reason for that\ninconsistency.\u201d SCI Reply at 10. This argument is unavailing. This Court will not grant preliminary injunctive relief\non the basis that associations are dissatisfied with an agency\u2019s explanation for why, after years of considering an issue,\nit did not decide the issue the same way it decided another issue related to a completely different animal species.\n                                                           16\n\fOpp. Mem. at 16, which makes them wholly distinguishable from the Three Antelope species. The\n\nFederal Defendants also note that disparate treatment of captive and native populations of Nile\n\nCrocodiles was abolished in less than 18 months. See SCI Opp. Mem at 18 n.7 (citing 53 Fed. Reg.\n\n38,451 (Sept. 30, 1998); 50 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.11(h)). The FWS was also \u201crecently petitioned to list all\n\nchimpanzees as endangered. . . .\u201d Id. (citing 76 Fed. Reg. 54,423 (Sept. 1, 2011)). If all\n\nchimpanzees are listed as endangered, the Federal Defendants argue that there would be \u201cno\n\ninstances in which members of a species held in captivity are designated differently than the species\n\nin the wild.\u201d Id. The argument that the FWS made a wildly \u201cinconsistent\u201d decision here by not\n\ndistinguishing the wild and captive populations of the Three Antelope species is unavailing. SCI\n\nhas simply not demonstrated that FWS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in treating captive animals\n\ndifferently than native animals in its decision to list the Three Antelope species as endangered. 10\n\n         Nor has SCI shown that the FWS was obligated to designate a \u201cDistinct Population Segment\n\nPolicy\u201d (\u201cDPS\u201d) as it did in the cases of the Nile Crocodile and Chimpanzee, or to provide a reason\n\nfor not creating a DPS. First, the FWS may designate a DPS, in which an animal species is\n\ndesignated differently based on whether it is captive or in the wild, in its discretion. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1533(a)(1) (\u201cThe Secretary shall . . . determine whether any species is an endangered species or\n\nthreatened species . . .\u201d). Second, although a party may petition the FWS to determine whether\n\ndesignation of a DPS is appropriate, see 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533(b)(3)(A), SCI did not do so before the\n\nListing Rule went into effect, according to Federal Defendants. See SCI Opp. Mem. at 20. Thus,\n\nthe FWS was not required to designate a DPS, nor to explain why it had not done so. The resulting\n\nlisting decision, while different than the decision to distinguish between captive and native\n\n\n10\n  SCI argues that \u201c[f]ederal defendants . . . incorrectly inform the Court\u201d that the chimpanzees are the last example of a\ncase where the FWS has differentiated between captive and wild populations. SCI Reply at 12. SCI points to\nclassification of the Southern Resident killer whale by the National Marine Fisheries Service as another example. See\n70 Fed. Reg. 69,903, 69,910-11 (Nov. 18, 2005). Nevertheless, the Court is still not convinced that examples of this\ntype demonstrate that the FWS has in this case acted arbitrarily and capriciously by grouping together the wild and\ncaptive populations of the Three Antelope species in its Listing Decision.\n                                                           17\n\fmembers of the Chimpanzee and the Nile Crocodile species, has not been shown to be arbitrary and\n\ncapricious.\n\n               iii.    The FWS Decision to List the Captive Populations as Endangered Was\n                       Consistent with the Purpose of the Endangered Species Act\n\n       SCI argues that the FWS \u201cignored the conservation mandates of the ESA and the fact that\n\ninclusion of the captive populations would harm rather than serve the conservation of populations of\n\nthe three antelope species.\u201d SCI Mem. at 22. The Federal Defendants, however, respond that the\n\nFWS interpretation of the ESA, as embodied in the Listing Rule, is consistent with the purposes of\n\nthe ESA. SCI Opp. Mem. at 21. The Court agrees.\n\n       The purposes of the ESA are enumerated in section 1531(b):\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which\n       endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved, to provide a\n       program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and\n       to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and\n       conventions set forth in subsection (a) of this section.\n\n16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531(b).\n\n       SCI has not shown that the FWS has \u201cignored the conservation mandates of the ESA.\u201d\n\nIndeed, by listing both the captive and wild populations of the Three Antelope species as\n\nendangered, the FWS has ensured that prohibitions against taking, importing, and exporting will\n\napply to all members of the Three Antelope species. There will be no confusion about whether a\n\nparty is attempting to \u201ctake\u201d a captive-bred antelope or a wild antelope as there might be if only\n\nsome of the Three Antelope species were considered \u201cendangered.\u201d The FWS\u2019 decision to list the\n\nU.S. non-native captive-bred members of the Three Antelope species as endangered was clearly not\n\n\u201cerratic,\u201d as SCI argues. SCI Mem. at 25. It was not \u201cunexplained,\u201d nor \u201cinconsistent.\u201d Id. at 44.\n\nRather, it was based on years of research and included several comment periods.\n\n       SCI notes that the FWS itself acknowledged in 2005 that \u201c[l]isting the species without\n\nexempting the U.S. captive-bred population could be a deterrent to further captive breeding.\u201d\n                                                  18\n\fUnited States Department of Interior, Record of Compliance for a Rulemaking Document, signed\n\nby Robert R. Gabel, Acting Assistant Director, International Affairs, AR 237.0122, ECF No. 26,\n\nEx. S (Jan. 5, 2005) (cited in SCI Reply at 17-18). This is not a surprising revelation given that the\n\nFWS promulgated the exemption for the captive-bred Three Antelope species at the same time as it\n\nlisted them as endangered. Following Friends of Animals, however, the FWS needed to develop a\n\nregulation that was consistent with Judge Kennedy\u2019s decision that the exemption violated section 10\n\nof the ESA. The FWS decision to remove the exemption rather than to promulgate an alternative\n\nregulation, or to delist the captive-bred Three Antelope species, has not been shown to be arbitrary\n\nand capricious. Accordingly, SCI has not demonstrated that the initial Listing Decision was\n\n\u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and thus has not shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits.\n\n           b. EWA Action\n\n       The EWA plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for a Preliminary Injunction asks the Court to enjoin the Final\n\nRule, which is the same rule the EWA plaintiffs challenge in their underlying lawsuit. The EWA\n\nplaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious because (1) \u201cthere is no support in the\n\nrecord for the permitting scheme[,]\u201d EWA Mem. at 19; (2) \u201cFWS failed to consider alternatives to\n\nthe permitting scheme[,]\u201d id. at 21; and (3) \u201cFWS failed to consider delisting the U.S. captive-bred\n\npopulations.\u201d Id. at 30. The EWA plaintiffs further argue that the Final Rule is contrary to law (4)\n\n\u201cbecause it destroys rather than conserves the species as required by [section 7(a)(2) of] the ESA[,]\u201d\n\nid. at 31; and (5) \u201cbecause FWS failed to consider the environmental impacts as required by the\n\n[National Environmental Policy Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d)]\u201d. Id. at 34. The Federal Defendants argue that the\n\nEWA plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims because the plaintiffs have not\n\nprovided legal support for their claims and because their claims are otherwise meritless.\n\nSpecifically, the Federal Defendants argue that (1) the Final Rule \u201cis entirely rational and supported\n\nby the record[,]\u201d EWA Opp. Mem. at 16; (2) the FWS \u201cadequately responded to comments and, to\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fthe extent required, adequately considered alternatives,\u201d id. at 18; (3) the FWS \u201cdid not have to\n\nconsider delisting the U.S. population of the three antelope species in the context of the removal of\n\nthe management rule[,]\u201d id. at 20; (4) and, since the plaintiffs \u201cfailed to provide the required notice\n\nfor their Section 7 claim, the [FWS] did not have to consult under ESA Section 7, and in any case,\n\nthe [Final Rule] will not jeopardize the continued existence of the species.\u201d Id. at 24. The Federal\n\nDefendants also argue that the plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their NEPA claim. Id. at 26-\n\n31. For the reasons explained below, the Court agrees that the EWA plaintiffs have not established\n\nthat they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.\n\n               i.      The Final Rule Is Supported by the Record\n\n       The EWA plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious \u201cbecause there is no\n\nsupport in the record for the permitting scheme.\u201d EWA Mem. at 19. The plaintiffs argue that the\n\nFWS\u2019 assertion that it \u201cdoes not believe that ranchers or other holders of these species that are\n\nworking for the conservation of the species will reduce or eliminate their herds just because a\n\npermit or other authorization will be required\u201d is baseless because the record is \u201cchockfull\u201d of\n\ncomments stating that \u201cthese three species will soon disappear from the face of the earth if the\n\npermitting scheme [in] the rule is imposed on the ranchers.\u201d Id. at 19-20. \u201cThat FWS simply\n\nignored this evidence and promulgated the rule anyway,\u201d the EWA plaintiffs argue, \u201cis plainly\n\narbitrary and capricious.\u201d Id. at 21.\n\n       The Federal Defendants argue, however, that the decision to issue the Final Rule was a\n\n\u201crational\u201d one supported by the record. EWA Opp. Mem. at 16. Specifically, the Federal\n\nDefendants argue that the FWS issued the Final Rule in order to comply with Judge Kennedy\u2019s\n\ndecision in Friends of Animals. Id. at 16. They argue that they had \u201cto act to comply with the\n\nCourt\u2019s order and, conversely, not acting would have allowed a regulation that violates the ESA to\n\nremain in place.\u201d Id. The Court agrees. Judge Kennedy ruled that the FWS rule exempting the\n\n\n                                                   20\n\fThree Antelope species from many of the regulations and prohibitions of ESA violated ESA section\n\n10(c), by not providing the public notice and an opportunity to comment on each permit application,\n\nand remanded the matter to the FWS for further proceedings consistent with his decision. The\n\nFWS\u2019 decision to remove the exemption for captive-bred animals of the Three Antelope species\n\nwas consistent with Judge Kennedy\u2019s decision. The FWS decision means that the Three Antelope\n\nspecies will be subject to the permitting requirements attendant to animals listed as \u201cendangered\u201d\n\nunder the Endangered Species Act. The Court agrees with the Federal Defendants that the decision\n\nto issue a Final Decision consistent with Judge Kennedy\u2019s opinion, and after a public comment\n\nperiod, was not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n               ii.     The FWS Adequately Responded to Comments and Considered\n                       Alternatives to the Final Rule to the Extent it Was Required to Do So\n\n       The EWA plaintiffs next argue that the Final Rule is \u201carbitrary and capricious because FWS\n\nfailed to consider alternatives to the permitting scheme.\u201d EWA Mem. at 21. \u201cNot only did FWS\n\nimpose an arbitrary, one-size-fits-all rule never meant to apply to these ranches,\u201d the EWA plaintiffs\n\nargue, but \u201cFWS also completely failed to consider any alternative to the permitting scheme\n\nenvisioned in the final rule.\u201d Id. As the Federal Defendants point out, the EWA plaintiffs do not\n\npoint to any authority to suggest that the FWS had to consider any other particular alternatives.\n\nEWA Opp. Mem. at 18; see, e.g, WHHT, Inc. v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393162\"><a href=\"/opinion/393162/wwht-inc-and-wometco-home-theatre-inc-v-federal-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (\u201cIt is\n\nonly in the rarest and most compelling of circumstances that this court has acted to overturn an\n\nagency judgment not to institute rulemaking.\u201d). Even so, the FWS noted in the preamble to the\n\nFinal Rule that it had \u201cconsidered whether there were alternative means to comply with the Court\u2019s\n\nruling [in Friends of Animals] without requiring ranches or other facilities holding these species to\n\nobtain a permit or other authorization.\u201d 77 Fed. Reg. at 432. \u201cHowever,\u201d the FWS noted, it \u201cwas\n\nunable to identify an alternative other than the currently established regulations at 50 C.F.R.\n\n17.21(g) and 17.22 \u2013 providing for the registration of captive-bred wildlife or issuance of a permit \u2013\n                                                  21\n\fthat would provide the public an opportunity to comment on proposed activities being carried out\n\nwith these species.\u201d Id.\n\n       The EWA plaintiffs also argue that the FWS failed to respond to numerous comments about\n\nthe Final Rule during the comment period. EWA Mem. at 22-30. The FWS argues convincingly,\n\nhowever, that it was not required to respond to alternatives to removing the exemption rule if the\n\nalternative suggestions did not \u201coffer a solution to fix the ESA Section 10(c) problem . . . .\u201d EWA\n\nOpp. Mem. at 19. Since the FWS only proposed the Final Rule in order to be consistent with Judge\n\nKennedy\u2019s decision with respect to ESA Section 10(c), not answering those comments that were\n\noutside of the scope of this rulemaking is not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n               iii.    The FWS Was Not Required To Consider Delisting the Captive-Bred\n                       Three Antelope Species\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is \u201carbitrary and capricious because FWS failed to\n\nconsider delisting the U.S. captive-bred populations.\u201d EWA Mem. at 30. The EWA plaintiffs argue\n\nthat \u201c[f]or no reason at all FWS refused to consider removing the three species from the endangered\n\nspecies list \u2013 even though they would not have been listed without the tandem exemption rule back\n\nin 2005 . . . .\u201d Id. The Federal Defendants argue, and the Court agrees, however, that FWS was not\n\nrequired to initiate a delisting of the Three Antelope species, or even consider a delisting, as part of\n\nits rulemaking with respect to the Final Rule. EWA Opp. Mem. at 20-23. Not considering delisting\n\nthe captive-bred species from endangered species status does not establish that the FWS acted\n\narbitrary and capriciously in issuing the Final Rule.\n\n               iv.     Plaintiffs Have Not Shown That The Challenged Rule Is Contrary To\n                       Law \u201cBecause It Destroys Rather Than Conserves The Species As\n                       Required By The ESA\u201d\n\n       The plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule is \u201ccontrary to law because it destroys rather than\n\nconserves the species as required by the ESA.\u201d EWA Mem. at 31. The EWA plaintiffs argue that\n\nthat \u201cFWS was obligated under the ESA to ensure the conservation of these three species of\n                                                   22\n\fendangered antelope but did not do so . . . .\u201d Id. at 34. \u201cSince the ultimate goal of the ESA is for\n\nspecies to be removed from the endangered or threatened lists because of recovery,\u201d the EWA\n\nplaintiffs argue, \u201caction that limits (or prevents) the endangered antelope populations from\n\nrecovering is contrary to the requirements of the ESA.\u201d Id. at 32. The EWA plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe permitting requirements that will go into effect on April 4, 2012 will \u201cresult in a reduction of the\n\nreproduction, numbers, and distribution of the antelope,\u201d which will mean a \u201cdecrease in genetic\n\ndiversity,\u201d and will \u201calso ultimately reduce the sustainable population size.\u201d Id. at 33-34. The FWS\n\nconsidered these possible implications of the Final Rule, however, and disagreed with the plaintiffs.\n\nThe Federal Defendants note in particular that the FWS \u201cconsidered the possibility that holders of\n\nU.S. captive members of the Three Antelope species might dispose of their stock rather than obtain\n\nauthorization or permits before carrying out previously exempted activities and determined that it\n\ndid not believe this would occur, and, if it did, that it would not significantly impact the\n\nconservation of the species.\u201d EWA Opp. Mem. at 31 (citing 77 Fed. Reg. at 433 (Resp. to Cmt. 4)).\n\nWhile the plaintiffs have raised compelling questions about the implications of the Final Rule, the\n\nCourt concludes that the plaintiffs have not shown that the FWS decision to issue the Final Rule\n\nwas contrary to law. Accordingly, while the Court need not reach a final decision on the plaintiffs\u2019\n\nclaims in the context of the instant motions, it concludes that plaintiffs have not carried the burden\n\nof showing their likelihood of success on the merits, as would be necessary for this Court to grant\n\npreliminary injunctive relief. 11\n\n\n\n\n11\n   The plaintiffs also argue that the Final Rule is \u201ccontrary to law because FWS failed to consider the environmental\nimpacts as required by the NEPA.\u201d EWA Mem. at 34. Under Section 102(2)(C) of NEPA, agencies shall \u201cinclude in\nevery recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the\nquality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on,\u201d inter alia, \u201cthe environmental\nimpact of the proposed action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332. The EWA plaintiffs argue that the FWS \u201ccircumvented compliance\nwith these requirements, claiming that the rulemaking in this case was \u2018administrative\u2019 and \u2018legal\u2019 in nature, and\nrequired by the district court\u2019s invalidation of an earlier rule.\u201d EWA Mem. at 34. The Court concludes that the EWA\nplaintiffs have not shown a likelihood of success on this question. The Court declines, however, to provide a detailed\nstatutory analysis on this issue until there is more complete briefing from the parties.\n                                                          23\n\f   2.      Plaintiffs Do Not Establish That A Preliminary Injunction Is Necessary To Prevent\n           Irreparable Harm\n\n        The plaintiffs argue that, although the Final Rule does not go into effect until April 4, 2012,\n\n\u201cthe harm is already occurring.\u201d SCI Mem. at 32. The FWS\u2019 enforcement of the endangered\n\nspecies status, SCI argues, has already \u201cproved to be cataclysmic for the conservation of these\n\nspecies.\u201d Id. at 41. EWA argues that \u201c[t]he draconian effect of this new rule is easy to predict since\n\npublication of the proposed rule last summer, many owners have already disposed of half or all of\n\ntheir oryx, addax and dama gazelles.\u201d EWA Mem. at 2. These claims about the adverse impact on\n\nthe U.S. herds of these endangered species from the Final Rule, even before it becomes effective,\n\nare obviously disturbing. Neither SCI nor the EWA plaintiffs have shown, however, that they are\n\nentitled to a preliminary injunction because they will suffer irreparable harm. In the case of both\n\nSCI and the EWA plaintiffs, the harm alleged is (1) primarily economic and (2) in any case,\n\nremedied by the permit practice that is already in place.\n\n               a.      Alleged Irreparable Harm is Primarily Economic\n\n        The plaintiffs\u2019 primary arguments for irreparable harm are economic harm arguments. SCI\n\nargues that \u201c[t]he value of these animals has plummeted which has severely undermined the ability\n\nof ranchers to continue to invest in these animals and to continue to feed, maintain, and breed these\n\nanimals.\u201d SCI Mem. at 32. SCI emphasizes that \u201c[t]he reality of conservation is that it is dependent\n\nupon funding.\u201d Id. According to SCI, some ranchers have already sold their herds of the Three\n\nAntelope species in anticipation of the Final Rule, which has led to an increase in sellers, resulting\n\nin a \u201cglut in the market and a precipitous drop in the value of these animals.\u201d Id. These events,\n\naccording to SCI, \u201cdemonstrate the irreparable harm that the enforcement of endangered status is\n\nbringing to the conservation of these animals and to those who wish to own, hunt, conserve, and\n\notherwise enjoy them.\u201d SCI Mem. at 33; Decl. of Thomas Wier, Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No.\n\n26, Ex. BB, at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13 (noting that the value of his male scimitar-horned oryx dropped from a\n                                                  24\n\fvalue of $3,500 to a value of $1,100); Decl. of Timothy Mark Terry, Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF\n\nNo. 26, Ex.

See Ed Valicek Decl., Case No. 12-cv-00340, ECF No. 3, Ex. L, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5 (noting that he has\n\nalready reduced his herd from between 75-100 animals to 47 and plans to sell the rest if the FWS\n\npermitting requirements go into effect); Tommy E.

The EWA\n\nplaintiffs tell of the economic loss to individual ranchers. Eddy Blassingame, for example, \u201cbought\n\nhis exotic animal ranch and started breeding scimitar-horned oryx with the dream of passing along\n\nsomething to his children and grandchildren.\u201d EWA Mem. at 40. \u201c[W]ith the permitting\n\nrequirements . . . ,\u201d however, \u201cand the resulting impact on the values of the animals and the ranch as\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fa whole, he now sees it as more of [a] liability.\u201d Id. at 40-41. The EWA plaintiffs argue that these\n\nstories of loss are not isolated to individuals and are reflected community-wide amongst those\n\nranchers involved with the Three Antelope species, noting with linguistic flourish that \u201c[f]ew\n\nplagues have proved as lethal to a species as the FWS [F]inal [R]ule.\u201d Id. at 41.\n\n        The Court does not underestimate the significance of the economic loss to individual\n\nranchers resulting from the depreciation in the value of the animals. Nevertheless, the standard for\n\nshowing irreparable harm in this jurisdiction is strict, and economic harm alone is generally not\n\nsufficient to warrant this Court\u2019s granting of a motion for a preliminary injunction. The D.C.\n\nCircuit has made it clear that \u201ceconomic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Gas Co. v.

While the plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are\n\nfacing or may face significant economic loss, they have not demonstrated that the existence of their\n\nbusinesses is imperiled by the market changes in the economic value of the Three Antelope\n\nspecies. 12\n\n\n12\n  The economic success of the private ranchers depends on the willingness of sportsmen to pay thousands of dollars for\nthe opportunity to hunt an animal from the Three Antelope species. See Decl. of Timothy Mark Terry, ECF No. 26, Ex.\nCC, \u00b6 11 (\u201cI sold scimitar-horned oryx hunts for $2,750 and addax hunts for $5,000); see also SCI Notice of\nInformation Regarding Permit Implications, ECF No. 57, at 2 (\u201cthe hunting and sale of hunts . . . have been the\n                                                         26\n\f        Furthermore, the plaintiffs have not shown that a temporary injunction would stop or reverse\n\nthe drop in the value of these animals that has already taken place. Thus, to the extent that the\n\nplaintiffs are presenting purely economic harm arguments, these arguments do not suffice to\n\nwarrant the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief.\n\n             b.           Any Potential Irreparable Harm is Remedied By The Permitting\n                          Regulations Already in Place\n\n        Although SCI acknowledges that \u201cthe underpinnings\u201d of the harm it is alleging are financial,\n\nSCI argues that \u201cthe harm cannot be recompensed via the reimbursement of funds\u201d and the \u201closs to\n\nconservation is the irreparable harm that only an injunction can remedy.\u201d SCI Mem. at 32-33.\n\nLikewise, the EWA plaintiffs also emphasize that this economic loss does more than devastate the\n\nranchers. Specifically, they state that there is a \u201crush on hunting these three antelope species\u201d since\n\nthe notice of the FWS Final Rule. EWA Mem. at 42. \u201cWhile the market has dropped out for the\n\nExotic Wildlife Ranchers who wish to breed, raise, conserve, and have \u2018live sales\u2019 of these species,\n\nthe same cannot be said for those wishing to hunt the species. In fact, the FWS rule has caused an\n\nexplosion of hunting before the rule goes into effect.\u201d Id. The EWA plaintiffs also argue that the\n\nelimination of the U.S. captive-bred members of the Three Antelope species may also \u201chalt efforts\n\nto reintroduce these species in their native lands.\u201d Id. The Federal Defendants argue that SCI will\n\nnot be irreparably harmed with respect to its interest in the conservation of the Three Antelope\n\nspecies because ranchers \u201cshould be able to continue [their] activities,\u201d but will now require a\n\npermit to do so. SCI Opp. Mem. at 29 (quoting 77 Fed. Reg. at 433). The Court agrees that any\n\npotential irreparable harm with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 interest in the animals, and conservation of\n\nthe animals, is remedied by the permitting regulations that are already in place.\n\n\n\nmainstay of the three antelope species\u2019 conservation for the last few decades.\u201d). If, as claimed, fewer ranchers handle\nthese animals, no party explains whether the value of and concomitant price for such hunts may increase to the benefit\nof those ranchers who both continue to support the animals and engage in the available permitting process to allow such\nhunts.\n                                                          27\n\f        The regulations in place after the Final Rule goes into effect on April 4, 2012 should allow\n\nplaintiffs to continue raising the animals from the Three Antelope species. First, the ESA does not\n\nregulate \u201cpurely intrastate activities (with the exception of take).\u201d 77 Fed. Reg. at 433. Thus,\n\nplaintiffs will be able to continue to possess animals, transport them within the state, or sell them to\n\nanother party within the state without a permit. SCI Opp. Mem. at 29. Beyond those activities,\n\npermits will be available for many of the other activities currently engaged in by the plaintiffs. The\n\nFederal Defendants explain:\n\n        For example, to sell and transport these animals between States, Plaintiff\u2019s members\n        may either obtain an interstate commerce permit for the sale (Form 3-200-37) or they\n        may engage in multiple interstate sales if both parties register for a \u201ccaptive-bred\n        wildlife\u201d (or CBW) permit (Form 3-200-41). Van Norman Decl. \u00b6 3. If Plaintiff\u2019s\n        members get a captive-bred wildlife permit, they may also cull their animals as\n        necessary to maintain a viable and healthy herd. Id. Plaintiff\u2019s members that obtain\n        a captive-bred wildlife permit, however, are required to submit annual reports to the\n        Service (Form 3-200-41a). Id. \u00b6 4. The interstate commerce permit is valid for a\n        single sale; the captive-bred wildlife permits are valid for five years. Id. \u00b6 3. More\n        than 400 facilities nation-wide currently hold captive-bred wildlife permits\n        (including both zoos and individual hobbyists). Id. \u00b6 9. In addition, if Plaintiff\u2019s\n        members want to allow hunters to come onto their ranches to hunt these animals,\n        they will also have to obtain a \u201ctake\u201d permit (Form 3-200-37). Id. \u00b6 5. The take\n        permit is valid for one year, but may be renewed annually. Id.\n\nSCI Opp. Mem. at 29-30 (footnotes omitted). 13\n\n        Notwithstanding the availability of this permitting process, the plaintiffs argue that the\n\nirreparable harm facing its members cannot be avoided by obtaining permits. SCI argues, for\n\nexample, that \u201c[t]he permits will not restore the value of these animals, nor will they rejuvenate the\n\nmarket for surplus animals. Permits in the hands of Safari Club members will not reverse the fact\n\nthat numerous ranchers and breeders have chosen not to continue to maintain their herds and that\n\nthere will be fewer herds, fewer animals and fewer opportunities to hunt and conserve these\n\nantelope.\u201d SCI Mem. at 40. The EWA plaintiffs also warn that the permitting requirements that will\n\n13\n  Indeed, a number of ranchers have applied for permits to engage in interstate commerce and the take of these animals.\nAccording to the FWS, of the 62 applications received since January 17, 2012, the FWS has granted 26 permits for\nthese activities, denied none and have the remaining under review.

The Federal Defendants point out that \u201conly one of the Plaintiffs has chosen to apply.\u201d Id.\n                                                          28\n\fbe in effect after April 4, 2012 are potentially dangerous to the future of the Three Antelope species.\n\nThey reference, for example, the decline of a closely-related species, the Arabian Oryx. \u201cListed as\n\nan endangered species in the 1970\u2019s, the Arabian oryx has long been subject to the same permitting\n\nrequirements and restrictions that will be imposed by the [F]inal [R]ule. There were more than\n\n1,500 Arabian oryx in the United States when they were listed; today, there are less than 250.\u201d\n\nEWA Mem. at 42. Similarly, the EWA plaintiffs invoke the fate of the Barasingha Deer to warn the\n\nCourt of the possible effects of a permitting requirement for ranchers. As one of the plaintiffs\n\nexplains, \u201c[b]ecause these Barasingha Deer were subject to the permitting requirements as soon as\n\nthey were listed, we have to get a time consuming government permit and annual government\n\napproval to harvest a Barasingha for meat, trophy or cull . . . Since no one will buy them, and we no\n\nlonger want them on our place, we were told by the government that our only option is to separate\n\nthe males and females and let them attrite away.\u201d EWA Mem. at 3 (quoting Nancy Green Decl.,\n\nCase No. 12-cv-00340, Ex. I, \u00b6 2). The plaintiffs argue that requiring ranchers to seek permits to\n\ncontinue working with the Three Antelope species will similarly lead to the decline of the captive-\n\nbred Three Antelope species.\n\n       The plaintiffs engage in a certain level of hyperbole in describing what will happen to\n\nranchers holding members of the Three Antelope species upon the effective date of the Final Rule.\n\nThe EWA plaintiffs state, for example, that \u201cwhen the FWS permit requirement goes into effect,\n\nExotic Wildlife Ranchers\u2019 raising herds of the three antelope species without a permit becomes\n\nillegal, subjecting them to civil and criminal penalties under the Endangered Species Act.\u201d EWA\n\nMem. on Penalties of ESA that Become Effective April 4, 2012, ECF No. 56, at 2. SCI asserts that\n\n\u201cRanchers/owners cannot even segregate their males from females to prevent further breeding as\n\nthis is an activity that likely qualifies as a \u2018taking\u2019 which is prohibited by regulation under the\n\nEndangered Species Act.\u201d SCI Notice of Information Regarding Permit Implications, ECF No. 57,\n\n\n                                                   29\n\fat 1-2. In response to the Court\u2019s request 14 for supplemental information to clarify the ranching\n\nactivities that would be prohibited by the ESA without a permit upon the effective date of the Final\n\nRule, the FWS made amply clear that these predictions are incorrect. After the Final Rule becomes\n\neffective, ranchers \u201cmay continue to possess these animals, transport them within a State, or sell\n\nthem to another party in the same State.\u201d Fed. Defs.\u2019 Statement on the Effects of the Rescission\n\nRule, ECF No. 55, at 3. The Federal Defendants further state that \u201cContrary to the claims of\n\nopposing counsel, even if the Plaintiffs do not obtain the necessary permits, the Rescission Rule will\n\nnot render it illegal to possess these antelope, to hold them captive, or to enclose them within a\n\nfence. The Plaintiffs may also engage in generally accepted animal husbandry practices, breeding\n\nprocedures, and veterinary care of these captive endangered species.\u201d Id. Plaintiffs will still be able\n\nto cull and hunt the animals after the Final Rule becomes effective, \u201cif they obtain the required\n\npermits.\u201d Id. at 3-4.\n\n           The Court does not find the plaintiffs\u2019 assertions about irreparable harm sufficiently\n\npersuasive to grant the extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief. The FWS has\n\nprovided a viable permitting process through which ranchers and other interested parties could have\n\nsought permits to continue their activities related to the Three Antelope species for the duration of\n\nthese lawsuits. Many ranchers have already availed themselves of this process and obtained\n\npermits. See note 13, supra. The plaintiffs\u2019 failure to do so \u2013 or lack of interest in maintaining\n\nthese animals if permitting requirements are in place \u2013 does not constitute a reason for this Court to\n\ngrant them the extraordinary remedy of injunctive relief from a Final Rule, which the plaintiffs have\n\nknown is going into effect at least since it was announced in early January of 2012. By applying for\n\npermits, the plaintiffs and other interested parties could have protected their interest in continuing\n\nwith their activities with the Three Antelope species for the duration of this lawsuit. See, e.g., Decl.\n\n\n14\n     The Court made this request during a telephonic conference with the parties on April 2, 2012.\n                                                             30\n\fof Timothy Mark Terry, Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No. 26, Ex.

The Seventh Circuit found\n\nthe plaintiff \u201cwould incur no detriment by the act of applying\u201d for the license, and rejected the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s contention that it would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction. Id. at 849. In the\n\nCourt\u2019s view, if the plaintiff went out of business, such injury would be self-inflicted because the\n\nplaintiff could have avoided that injury by simply applying for a license.

SCI argues, for example, that\n\n\u201c[t]he announcement of permits and federal regulation required by the enforcement of endangered\n\nstatus for these populations affected the market for these animals and undermined the incentive for\n\ncontinued conservation.\u201d Id. \u201cThe result,\u201d SCI argues, \u201cis fewer breeders, fewer animals,\n\ndepressed value and a stark reversal of the conservation achievements won through a free market\n\nand sustainable use conservation.\u201d Id.     Similarly, the EWA plaintiffs note that FWS\u2019 permit\n\nsystem was designed for zoos and wildlife preserves and that the permit system \u201crobs the Exotic\n\nWildlife Ranchers of the economic incentive \u2013 destroying the private captive breeding system that\n\nhas saved these three African antelope species from extinction.\u201d EWA Reply at 6.\n\n        This kind of market harm, however, even where it impacts the fate of the animals, is just not\n\nsufficient to warrant preliminary injunctive relief, especially where the status of the Three Antelope\n\n\n                                                    32\n\fspecies as endangered species has been a topic of debate over a period of many years and where\n\nranchers had the opportunity to seek permits to alleviate at least temporarily some of the forces of\n\nthe market that were outside of their control. Even if the FWS \u201cgrossly underestimates the burdens\n\nof its regulatory permitting requirements for these ranchers,\u201d see EWA Reply at 15, a burdensome\n\npermitting system to take or hunt an animal listed as an \u201cendangered species\u201d is not sufficient\n\njustification for a preliminary injunction in this case. SCI has not demonstrated irreparable harm to\n\nwarrant preliminary injunctive relief.\n\n   3.      Plaintiffs Do Not Establish That The Balance Of Equities Tips In Their Favor\n\n        SCI points out that the Federal Defendants and SCI \u201cactually agree that the balance of\n\ninterests, including public interest, must tilt in favor of protected species.\u201d SCI Reply at 23.\n\nSimilarly, the EWA plaintiffs note that \u201c[a] preliminary injunction, pending resolution of the validity\n\nof the FWS\u2019s new permit rule, helps the species \u2013 and so aids, not injures, FWS.\u201d EWA Mem. at\n\n43. The Federal Defendants and the plaintiffs of course disagree on what \u201chelping the species\u201d\n\nmeans. While the FWS stands behind its decision to implement the Final Rule, SCI, for example,\n\nargues, instead, that the \u201cbest medicine for three antelope conservation would be to return to a free,\n\nunrestricted trade system and let the ranching and hunting community restore their extremely\n\nsuccessful private conservation system.\u201d SCI Reply at 24. SCI argues that it seeks only to\n\n\u201cmaintain the status quo\u201d and that the government\u2019s \u201cpotential harm from a grant of preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief would be minimal if not non-existent.\u201d SCI Mem. at 41. The Federal Defendants\n\ncounter that SCI is seeking more than maintenance of the \u201cstatus quo,\u201d and that, by seeking to\n\nenjoin enforcement of endangered status for the U.S. captive members of the Three Antelope\n\nspecies, SCI is actually arguing that \u201cabsolutely zero protections would apply to these animals.\u201d\n\nSCI Opp. Mem. at 36.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   33\n\f        The Court concludes that the balance of equities tips towards the FWS here given its\n\nCongressionally mandated role of protecting endangered species.

Plaintiffs Do Not Establish That The Public Interest Will Be Served By The\n           Requested Injunctive Relief\n\n        Similarly to the discussion concerning the balance of harms, the Federal Defendants and\n\nplaintiffs disagree over whether the public interest in conservation of the Three Antelope Species\n\nwould be more or less served by enforcement of the ESA and the Final Rule against U.S. captive\n\nherds of these animals. According to SCI, its requested \u201cstay of endangered status enforcement will\n\nrestore incentives for private ranchers to continue, recommence or even initiate breeding operations\n\nfor the three species, and will rejuvenate the market for surplus animals,\u201d thereby \u201crestor[ing] the\n\nsystem by which the species\u2019 conservation has long been achieved through sustainable use.\u201d SCI\n\nMem. at 42-43. Likewise, the EWA plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule \u201cthreatens to extinguish\n\nboth\u201d the Three Antelope species and the $1.3 billion exotic wildlife ranching industry, with an\n\nassociated 14,000 jobs, and that, therefore, the public interest favors issuance of injunctive relief\n\nstaying enforcement of the Final Rule \u201cto conserve these endangered antelope.\u201d EWA Mem. at 44.\n\nThe Texas Department of Agriculture, which the Court permitted to file an amicus brief, expresses\n\nits view in stark terms that \u201cthe Final Rule will kill the sport of hunting these animals, which in turn\n\nwill kill the industry of breeding and raising these animals, which in turn will kill, through\n\nregulation, the three species of Antelope made the subject of this suit, leading to their inevitable\n                                                   34\n\fextinction.\u201d Amicus Curiae Brief of the Texas Department of Agriculture in Supp. of Pls.\u2019 Mot. for\n\nPrelim. Inj., Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No. 52, at 4.\n\n       The FWS does not dispute the contributions of private ranching to the conservation of the\n\nThree Antelope species, nor the economic benefits to ranchers and others of the current regulatory\n\nscheme. Instead, the FWS points out that the Final Rule, although eliminating the Captive-bred\n\nExemption, would permit continued handling of the animals, including culling and sport hunting.\n\nSee Decl. Van Norman, Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No. 35, Ex. 1, \u00b6 3 (\u201cRegistration under the\n\nCBW program also allows a facility to cull animals in its herd to maintain a viable and healthy\n\nherd.\u201d); \u00b6 5 (\u201cIn order to allow outside hunters to come on to a ranch to hunt animals, the facility\n\nmust obtain an interstate commerce/take permit . . . Through the permit process, the ranch would\n\nidentify the number of animals that would likely be culled to maintain a healthy population over a\n\none-year period [and] [i]f the application were approved, . . . a single permit . . . would authorize all\n\napproved activities for a one-year period. This single permit would allow the facility to advertise all\n\nproposed hunts being anticipated during the one-year period to facilitate herd management, since\n\nmost advertisements would be considered interstate commerce, and it would authorize individuals\n\nother than employees of the facility to lethally take listed specimens.\u201d).\n\n       The FWS identifies two ways in which the public interest would be disserved if the\n\nrequested relief were granted. First, the relief requested by SCI would result in the wholesale de-\n\nregulation of any domestic activity regarding these animals, eliminating even the regulation in\n\neffect under the Captive-bred Exemption. The FWS explains that SCI seeks \u201cabsolutely zero\n\nprotections [to] apply to these animals\u201d so that \u201cranchers or other holders of these animals could do\n\nanything they wanted with these animals \u2013 move them in interstate or foreign commerce, or even\n\nallow lethal take,\u201d without having to comply with current regulatory requirements, let alone the\n\npermitting requirements that become effective with the Final Rule.

See SCI Opp. Mem. at 36. The FWS cautions that \u201callowing unregulated trade in the captive\n\nU.S. animals would undermine the conservation of the[se] species in the wild,\u201d id. at 37, by making\n\nit more difficult to enforce the ESA and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered\n\nSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora (\u201cCITES\u201d), which prohibits the import, export, trade and\n\npossession of species listed under the Convention, including the Three Antelope species. Id.; Van\n\nNorman Decl., Case No. 11-cv-01564, ECF No. 35, Ex. 1, \u00b6 12. Even accepting as entirely valid\n\nthe success under the current regulatory framework of private ranching in the conservation of the\n\nThree Antelope species, the Court cannot ignore the risk of the harms to these endangered species\n\nidentified by the FWS from elimination of all regulation of the Three Antelope species.\n\n       Moreover, the Court is cognizant that to effectuate the over-arching goal of the ESA to\n\nconserve endangered species, the law expressly requires the FWS to publish in the Federal Register\n\nnotice, with a 30 day comment period, of applications for permits to handle listed species in a\n\nmanner otherwise contrary to the law. Friends of Animals v. Salazar, 626 F. Supp. 2d at 106 (citing\n\n16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1539(c)). This provision provides a mechanism for \u201cmeaningful public participation\u201d\n\nand an opportunity for the public \u201cto monitor whether hunting ranches actually fulfill the purposes\n\nof the ESA . . . .\u201d Id. at 117-18. Since promulgation of the Captive-bred Exemption in 2005, this\n\nmechanism has been subverted and the public has been \u201cshut out,\u201d id. at 118, because the\n\nexemption allows holders of the Three Antelope species to engage in otherwise prohibited activities\n\nwithout a case-by-case review of each permit application. Granting the relief requested by the EWA\n\nplaintiffs to enjoin enforcement of the Final Rule, even though this request is more narrow than the\n\n\n                                                  36\n\frelief sought by SCI, would persist in denying the public that information which the ESA requires to\n\nbe made public under an exemption found to be unlawful almost three years ago. This is a\n\ndisservice to the public interest that weighs against grant of the requested injunctive relief.\n\nIV.
