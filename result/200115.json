Appellant Lydia Gonzalez\n\nchallenges various summary judgment rulings which prompted the\n\ndistrict    court    to    dismiss    the    claims    she    filed   against   her\n\nemployer,    El     Dia,   Inc.,     alleging   that     it   violated    the   Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq.,\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et\n\nseq., and various Puerto Rico statutes.                  The record facts are\n\nrelated in the light most favorable to Gonzalez.                      See Conto v.\n\nConcord Hosp., Inc., 265 F.3d 79, 80 n.1 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                         I\n\n                                     BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1991, at age 58, Gonzalez was hired as a reporter by\n\nEl Nuevo Dia, a Puerto Rico newspaper owned by defendant-appellee\n\nEl Dia.     During the ensuing years, her supervisor, Maria Luisa\n\nFerre, frequently stated, inter alia, that (i) Gonzalez' demeanor\n\nand couture were \"[o]ut of style\" and \"colorless,\" and her coiffure\n\n(\"like Phyllis Diller\") was old-fashioned (viz., \"manias de vieja,\"\n\nor \"old person's ways\"); (ii) she should have retired and gone to\n\nlive with her grandchildren in Florida long ago; and (iii) due to\n\nher age she would not live long enough to see her grandson play\n\nmajor league baseball.\n\n            On another occasion, after Ms. Ferre balked at Gonzalez'\n\nexpression of interest in covering fashion shows, Gonzalez stated:\n\n\"You want me to look like a Vogue model?\"               Rather than responding,\n\n\n                                         2\n\fMs. Ferre simply stared at Gonzalez. Moreover, Ms. Ferre routinely\n\nassigned younger reporters to cover the fashion shows and often\n\ntold Gonzalez:    \"Dona Lydia, I don't know what I'm going to do with\n\nyou.\"\n\n            Similar remarks were made to Gonzalez by Jorge Mercado,\n\nthe director of the human resources department, who frequently\n\nstated that Gonzalez had \"manias de vieja.\"            Moreover, often as\n\nGonzalez arrived at work in the morning, Mr. Mercado would accost\n\nher in the lobby and inquire:      \"Mom, can I help you?\" or \"What did\n\nyou come here for, to visit or to request a job?\"             In addition,\n\nwhen Mr. Mercado visited the department in which Gonzalez worked,\n\nhe would make such comments as:           \"Are you still here?\" or \"I\n\nthought you had been discharged or terminated a long time ago.\"\n\n            Following a serious work-related injury in April 1997,\n\nGonzalez applied to the State Insurance Fund (SIF) for workers'\n\ncompensation benefits.        The SIF determined that Gonzalez should\n\ntake medical leave while receiving treatment and rehabilitative\n\ntherapy.    Apparently concerned about Gonzalez' extended absence\n\nfrom    work,   Ms.   Ferre   contacted   the   El   Dia   human   resources\n\ndepartment regarding retirement packages which might be offered\n\nGonzalez.\n\n            On June 12, 1997, Gonzalez discussed her health problems\n\nand her job with Ms. Ferre.      At one point, Ms. Ferre asked Gonzalez\n\nwhether she would like to retire, adding:              \"Look, [] you are\n\n\n                                     3\n\falready 63 years old and your health is not good.\"           When Gonzalez\n\nresponded that she did not wish to retire and instead offered to\n\nreturn to work immediately, Ms. Ferre rejected her offer and\n\nadvised Gonzalez to take a vacation and return to work on July 1.\n\nAs Gonzalez had no remaining paid-vacation time, however, and Ms.\n\nFerre was well aware that Gonzalez was in difficult financial\n\nstraits, Ms. Ferre offered to make an advance on Gonzalez' salary.\n\nGonzalez     promptly   related    the   conversation   to    her   former\n\nsupervisor, Iris Landron.     On the following day, El Dia issued a\n\n$6,000 check to Gonzalez.     Although Gonzalez was surprised by the\n\nlarge amount and concerned about her ability to repay it, she\n\nnevertheless applied the entire advance toward her delinquent real\n\nestate mortgage.\n\n           On June 16, Mr. Mercado asked Gonzalez to come to his\n\noffice, where she was presented with a resignation, release, and\n\ncompensation agreement.     Mr. Mercado asserted that during her June\n\n12 meeting with Ms. Ferre, Gonzalez had agreed to execute these\n\ndocuments.     Gonzalez denied any such agreement, refused to sign,\n\nand informed Mr. Mercado that she planned to return to work on June\n\n19, rather than July 1.           Upon returning to work on June 20,\n\nGonzalez asked Mr. Mercado to draft an agreement, which she then\n\nsigned, promising to repay the $6,000 advance by June 27.\n\n             On June 27, Gonzalez and her union representatives met\n\nwith Mr. Mercado to explain that Gonzalez had been unable to obtain\n\n\n                                     4\n\fa bank loan with which to repay her $6,000 debt to El Dia.                Mr.\n\nMercado rejected Gonzalez' alternative offer either to tender\n\ncertain valuable artwork in lieu of cash or repay the loan through\n\npayroll deductions. After asserting that Gonzalez had breached the\n\nrepayment agreement in \"bad faith,\" Mr. Mercado suspended her\n\nwithout pay, albeit with benefits (viz., e.g., health and life\n\ninsurance), until such time as she repaid the $6,000 advance.\n\n            As Gonzalez was left without a source of income, yet\n\nrequired to mitigate damages, she accepted a position as a staff\n\nreporter with The San Juan Star, an El Nuevo Dia competitor, then\n\nsubmitted a grievance against El Dia pursuant to the collective\n\nbargaining agreement (CBA).          During the grievance proceeding,\n\nGonzalez    admitted   to   having   worked   for    The   San   Juan   Star.\n\nThereafter, on July 15, 1997, Mr. Mercado terminated Gonzalez,\n\nciting    the   conflict-of-interest     provision    in   the   CBA;   viz.,\n\n\"[r]eporters working for the newspaper shall work exclusively on\n\nreporting news for [the newspaper], and thus shall not write\n\narticles and/or columns for any newspaper other than [El Nuevo\n\nDia].\"1    (Emphasis added.)\n\n            In August 1998, Gonzalez initiated the present action\n\nagainst El Dia, Ms. Ferre, and Mr. Mercado in the United States\n\n     1\n      Gonzalez argues on appeal that the conflict-of-interest\nprovision in the CBA is inapposite because she was not \"working\nfor\" El Dia while she was suspended. As she failed to raise this\nclaim in her opposition to El Dia's motion for summary judgment,\nhowever, it has been waived. See Davis v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 251\nF.3d 227, 232 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                     5\n\fDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging inter alia\n\nthat her employment had been terminated in violation of the ADEA,\n\nthe ADA, and various Commonwealth of Puerto Rico statutes.      El Dia\n\ncounterclaimed for its $6,000 advance to Gonzalez.\n\n          Ultimately, the district court entered summary judgment\n\nfor El Dia, dismissed all claims in the Gonzalez complaint, and\n\nawarded El Dia summary judgment on its counterclaim.2       On appeal,\n\nGonzalez challenges the district court rulings which presaged the\n\ndismissal of her complaint.\n\n                                  II\n\n                              DISCUSSION\n\n          Summary judgment rulings are reviewed de novo, after all\n\nthe competent evidence and attendant reasonable inferences have\n\nbeen assessed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\n\nSee Conto, 265 F.3d at 80 n.1.3        Moreover, rather than weigh the\n\n\n     2\n      The earlier district court rulings, rejecting the Gonzalez\nclaims against Ms. Ferre and Mr. Mercado in their individual\ncapacities, are not before us on appeal.\n     3\n      The district court granted summary judgment to El Dia on the\ngrounds that: (i) the ageist comments attributed to Ms. Ferre,\nmade before and on June 12, 1997, were not probative, in that it\nwas Mr. Mercado, rather than Ms. Ferre, who determined that\nGonzalez should be suspended and terminated; (ii) Gonzalez failed\nto establish that Mr. Mercado made any discriminatory remark,\neither proximate to, or in the context of, the decision to suspend\nand/or terminate Gonzalez; (iii) Gonzalez adduced no evidence that\nEl Dia lacked legitimate alternative grounds for not assigning her\nto cover fashion shows; and (iv) the testimony given by Ms.\nLandron, Gonzalez' former supervisor \u2014 that the El Dia retirement\noffer was a subterfuge for age discrimination \u2014 constituted an\ninadmissible lay opinion, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 701.\n\n                                  6\n\fcredibility of the testimony, we presume that a rational factfinder\n\nwould accept it as stated by the witness.             See Santiago-Ramos v.\n\nCentennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 55 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nA.   The ADEA Claim\n\n            Under the ADEA, an employer may not \"discharge . . . or\n\notherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to [her]\n\ncompensation,     terms,    conditions,     or   privileges   of    employment,\n\nbecause of [her] age.\"            29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(a)(1).4          Gonzalez was\n\nrequired   to    comply    with   the   familiar   burden-sharing      paradigm\n\nestablished in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802\n\n(1995).    Thus, at the outset she needed to tender enough evidence\n\nto   establish    a   prima   facie     age-discrimination     claim.       See\n\nDominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc., 202 F.3d 424, 430 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).5    For present purposes, El Dia acknowledges that Gonzalez\n\nestablished a prima facie case under the ADEA.            See id.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Since many of the relevant legal standards applicable in\nemployment-discrimination cases arising under the ADEA, the ADA,\nand Title VII are closely comparable, see Dichner v. Liberty\nTravel, 141 F.3d 24, 30 n.5 (1st Cir. 1998), we cite to them as\nappropriate.\n      5\n      An ADEA claimant must adduce evidence that (1) she was at\nleast forty years of age; (2) her job performance met the\nemployer's legitimate expectations; (3) the employer subjected her\nto an adverse employment action (e.g., an actual or constructive\ndischarge); and (4) the employer had a continuing need for the\nservices provided by the position from which the claimant was\ndischarged. See Suarez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st\nCir. 2000).\n\n                                        7\n\f             The    required        prima-facie-case         showing       generates    a\n\nrebuttable presumption that the defendant-employer violated the\n\nADEA.   Whereupon, the burden of production \u2014 as distinguished from\n\nthe   burden   of    proof      \u2014       shifts   to   the    defendant-employer        to\n\narticulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its adverse\n\nemployment action.        Once this limited burden has been met by the\n\ndefendant-employer, the presumption which attended the prima facie\n\ncase vanishes and the claimant must adduce sufficient creditable\n\nevidence that       age   was       a    motivating   factor       in    the    challenged\n\nemployment action.        See id.          The plaintiff-employee may meet her\n\nburden of proof by showing that the employer's proffered reason for\n\nthe challenged employment action was pretextual, see id. at 430\n\nn.5, from which the factfinder in turn may, but need not, infer the\n\nalleged discriminatory animus.               See Fite v. Digital Equip. Corp.,\n\n232 F.3d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing\n\nProds., Inc., 530 U.S. 133 (2000)).\n\n             El Dia plainly met its circumscribed burden of production\n\nby    identifying     a   nondiscriminatory            basis       for    the    Gonzalez\n\ndischarge:     i.e., her acceptance of employment as a reporter for a\n\ncompeting    newspaper,      in         direct   violation    of    the    conflict-of-\n\ninterest provision in the CBA.               Cf., e.g., King v. Preferred Tech.\n\nGroup, 166 F.3d 887, 893 (7th Cir. 1999) (Family and Medical Leave\n\nAct) (noting that violation of CBA provision by employee was\n\nlegitimate nondiscriminatory basis for adverse employment action\n\n\n                                             8\n\ftaken by employer); Burmistrz v. City of Chicago, 186 F. Supp. 2d\n\n863, 873-74 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (same, under ADA).                     Accordingly, the\n\nburden       then    shifted      back   to       Gonzalez   to     prove     that    the\n\nnondiscriminatory basis assertedly relied upon by El Dia was merely\n\na pretext, and that age animus was the real reason for her\n\ntermination.\n\n                 At this stage in the proceedings, Gonzalez cannot dispute\n\nthat       she   knowingly    failed     to   comply     with     the    pertinent    CBA\n\nprovision, thereby entitling El Dia to discharge her.                       See Mechnig\n\nv. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 864 F.2d 1359, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988)\n\n(\"[Federal courts] do 'not sit as a super-personnel department that\n\nreexamines an entity's business decisions.' 'No matter how medieval\n\na firm's practices, no matter how high-handed its decisional\n\nprocess, no matter how mistaken the firm's managers, [the ADEA\n\ndoes] not interfere.'\") (citations omitted).6                           Accordingly, in\n\norder to establish that an age-based animus nonetheless constituted\n\na motivating factor in the decision to terminate her employment,\n\nGonzalez relies principally upon six varieties of evidence.\n\n       1.        The Ageist Remarks\n\n                 Gonzalez asserts that, prior to June 12, Mr. Mercado and\n\nMs. Ferre         engaged    in   a   \"pattern\"     of   workplace       remarks     which\n\ndemonstrate an age-based animus. See supra Section I. Upon closer\n\n\n\n       6\n      Gonzalez abandoned her grievance under the CBA, which was\nthen dismissed with prejudice.\n\n                                              9\n\fexamination, however, the stray remarks she identified afforded an\n\ninadequate foundation for the requisite discriminatory intent.\n\n             In the first place, \"stray workplace remarks,\" as well as\n\nstatements made either by nondecisionmakers or by decisionmakers\n\nnot involved in the decisional process, normally are insufficient,\n\nstanding alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite\n\ndiscriminatory animus.        See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 250\n\nF.3d 23, 36 (1st Cir. 2001); Laurin v. Providence Hosp., 150 F.3d\n\n52, 58 (1st Cir. 1998). The Gonzalez deposition identified neither\n\nthe time nor the context of the pre-June 12 remarks made by Mr.\n\nMercado and        Ms.   Ferre,   nor   could   Gonzalez   state   whether   any\n\nparticular remark had been made at a time proximate either to June\n\n12 or to her July 15 termination.             See, e.g., Dominguez-Cruz, 202\n\nF.3d at 433 n.6 (noting \"circumscribed\" evidentiary weight of\n\n\"temporally remote\" statements).\n\n             Secondly, it is far from clear that the alleged remarks\n\nbespeak any age-based animus at all.            See Fernandes v. Costa Bros.\n\nMasonry, Inc., 199 F.3d 572, 583 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that \"a\n\nstatement that plausibly can be interpreted two different ways -\n\none discriminatory and the other benign - does not directly reflect\n\nillegal animus\") (emphasis added); Speen v. Crown Clothing Corp.,\n\n102 F.3d 625, 636 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"'[A]mbiguous remarks, tending\n\nto suggest animus based on age, are insufficient, standing alone,\n\nto   prove    an    employer's     discriminatory    intent.'\")     (citations\n\n\n                                         10\n\fomitted; emphasis added); Lehman v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 74\n\nF.3d 323, 329 (1st Cir. 1996) (same).\n\n           Some statements, such as those made by Mr. Mercado,\n\nmerely displayed a measure of surprise that Gonzalez was still\n\nemployed at El Dia, without either asserting or implying that she\n\nwas too old to be working.    Moreover, Mr. Mercado's alleged use of\n\nthe salutation \"Mom\" \u2014 though no doubt insensitive, perhaps even\n\nrude \u2014 hardly constituted a self-sufficient foundation for an ADEA\n\nclaim, especially since these particular attributions \u2014 motherhood\n\nand advanced age \u2014 plainly are not synonymous.\n\n           Similarly, the remarks Ms. Ferre allegedly directed at\n\nGonzalez are reasonably susceptible to interpretation simply as\n\ndescriptions of the somewhat dowdy appearance and demeanor which\n\nGonzalez   herself   acknowledges.        Moreover,   the   Spanish   phrase\n\n\"manias de vieja\" (\"old ways\") did not unambiguously connote that\n\nGonzalez was old, let alone too old, but rather that she acted in\n\nways which did not appear in keeping with a person her age.            See,\n\ne.g., Pearson v. City of Manhattan, 33 F. Supp. 2d 1306, 1315 (D.\n\nKan. 1999) (holding that phrase \"old ways\" not evidence of ADEA\n\nage-based animus, as such terms \"apply more to a person's state of\n\nmind than to a person's age\"); Martin v. Ryder Distribution Res.,\n\nInc., 811 F. Supp. 658, 664 (S.D. Fla. 1992) (observing that simple\n\nreferences to the plaintiff-employees \u2014 as \"good old boys\" and\n\n\"old-fashioned\" \u2014 are insufficient evidence of age-based animus\n\n\n                                     11\n\funder ADEA), aff'd, 16 F.3d 1232 (11th Cir. 1994).                  Nor did any\n\nother statement, attributed either to Mr. Mercado or Ms. Ferre,\n\nunambiguously communicate an age-based animus.                  Rather, their\n\nremarks are readily susceptible to interpretations which are in no\n\nsense discriminatory.\n\n     2.   The Fashion Show Coverage\n\n          Similarly     unavailing        is   the     contention    that    the\n\nunexplained refusal to allow Gonzalez to cover fashion shows\n\ndemonstrated an age-based animus.         Given her acknowledged penchant\n\nfor old-fashioned clothing and hairstyles, it seems much more\n\nplausible to attribute El Dia's decision to the fact that Gonzalez\n\nwas insufficiently attuned to current fashions; and, therefore,\n\nthat her representation of El Dia at fashion shows could very well\n\nreflect adversely upon its business image in such circles.                   Cf.,\n\ne.g., Rogosin v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 197 F. Supp.\n\n2d 345, 351 (D. Md. 2002) (noting that employer has right under\n\nADEA to   consider   plaintiff-employee's        projection     of    \"negative\n\npublic image\").\n\n     3.   The Ferre-Mercado \"Conspiracy\"\n\n          Further,    Gonzalez   contends            that   since    Ms.    Ferre\n\nacknowledges that she contacted Mr. Mercado prior to June 12 in\n\nregard to the retirement plan, both should be considered El Dia\n\ndecisionmakers, and that Ms. Ferre's remark on June 12 \u2014 viz., \"you\n\nare already 63 years old and your health is not good\" \u2014 accordingly\n\n\n                                     12\n\fconstituted a discriminatory statement by a decisionmaker in the\n\ncontext of the adverse employment action taken against her by El\n\nDia.     The record on appeal does not square with her contention,\n\nhowever.\n\n             Instead, Ms. Ferre simply stated that she contacted the\n\nhuman    resources   department   prior    to   June    12   regarding   the\n\nretirement options available to Gonzalez.              There is no record\n\nsupport whatever for the notion that Ms. Ferre stated that she had\n\nspoken with Mr. Mercado about the matter. Accordingly, no rational\n\nfactfinder could construe Ms. Ferre's routine investigation into\n\nthe retirement options available to Gonzalez as either (i) somehow\n\nsinister or (ii) a rational basis for surmising that Ms. Ferre\n\nplayed a meaningful role in Mr. Mercado's subsequent decisions to\n\nsuspend and terminate Gonzalez.\n\n        4.   The Remarks Made by Ms. Ferre on June 12\n\n             On June 12, Ms. Ferre adverted to Gonzalez' age while the\n\ntwo were discussing Gonzalez' vacation plans and the retirement\n\noffer which had been made to her.         Of course the mere tender of a\n\nretirement proposal does not evince the requisite discriminatory\n\nanimus.      See Baralt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 251 F.3d 10, 16\n\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 1064 (2002); Alvarez-\n\nFonseca v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 152 F.3d 17, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).     Moreover, even viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nGonzalez, Ms. Ferre's statement plainly conveyed the rational\n\n\n                                   13\n\fconcern that retirement might prove the more prudent course,\n\nespecially since Gonzalez had been experiencing serious health\n\nproblems, as well as financial difficulties.            See Hoffman v. MCA,\n\nInc., 144 F.3d 1117, 1122 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding no age-based\n\nanimus in supervisor's mere observation that employee was \"getting\n\nold\"). Nor does Gonzalez contend that she felt pressured to retire\n\nby Ms. Ferre's reference to age.       Cf. Sempier v. Johnson & Higgins,\n\n45 F.3d 724, 732 (3d Cir. 1995) (\"[A]n early retirement program\n\ndesigned to force employees who reach a senior age to leave or face\n\nsignificant pressure to resign or retire might itself create an\n\ninference of age discrimination.\").\n\n            Yet more importantly, of course, the June 12 retirement-\n\nplan offer tendered by Ms. Ferre is not the adverse employment\n\naction at issue.     Rather, the two pertinent employment decisions\n\n(viz., the suspension without pay and the ensuing termination) were\n\nmade    later,   precipitated   not    by   Gonzalez'    age   but   by   her\n\nacknowledged (i) delinquency in repaying the $6,000 advance when\n\ndue, and (ii) violation of the conflict-of-interest provision in\n\nthe CBA.\n\n       5.   The Allegedly False Communication by Ms. Ferre to Mr.\n            Mercado\n\n            Additionally, Gonzalez stresses that, after June 12, Ms.\n\nFerre falsely informed Mr. Mercado that Gonzalez had accepted the\n\nretirement offer, thereby presumably causing the $6,000 check to\n\nissue and corroborating Gonzalez' acceptance, all in an elaborate\n\n                                      14\n\feffort to force Gonzalez to leave her employment.          Even viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to Gonzalez, see Conto, 265 F.3d at 80,\n\nn.1, any such inference would be highly speculative at the very\n\nleast.   We explain.\n\n             First, although at summary judgment we must credit the\n\nassertion attributed to Gonzalez on June 12 \u2014 that she never agreed\n\nto retire, see Santiago-Ramos, 217 F.3d at 55 \u2014 it does not follow\n\nthat Ms. Ferre spoke untruthfully.         Rather, Ms. Ferre simply may\n\nhave   misinterpreted     Gonzalez'    stated   intentions.     But   more\n\nimportantly, we are unable to conceive a plausible motive for Ms.\n\nFerre to misrepresent Gonzalez' intentions.              Had Gonzalez not\n\ndesired or agreed \u2014 on June 12 \u2014 to retire, surely her mere\n\nacceptance of the $6,000 loan itself would not have pressured her\n\ninto executing the retirement agreement, particularly in light of\n\n(i)    Mr.    Mercado's     ready     acceptance    of    Gonzalez'    own\n\ncharacterization of the June 12 transaction as a loan transaction,\n\nand (ii) Mr. Mercado's willingness to accommodate her suggestion\n\nthat a repayment agreement immediately be reduced to writing.\n\nFinally, Gonzalez' characterization of the $6,000 loan, as a mere\n\nsalary advance, severely strains credulity, especially since she\n\nattested that she had been surprised by the large amount of the\n\ncheck and wondered how she would repay it. Accordingly, the record\n\nis devoid of creditable evidence that Ms. Ferre, in issuing the\n\n\n\n\n                                      15\n\f$6,000 check to Gonzalez, harbored any illicit motive whatever, let\n\nalone an age-based animus.\n\n     6.     The Suspension Without Pay\n\n            Finally, Gonzalez points to Mr. Mercado's rejection of\n\nher alternative proposals for repaying the $6,000 loan; i.e.,\n\nthrough payroll deductions or by tendering \"valuable artwork\" in\n\nlieu of cash.    Mr. Mercado suspended Gonzalez for acting in \"bad\n\nfaith,\" presumably because she had insisted, a mere seven days\n\nearlier, that Mr. Mercado draw up a repayment agreement.   Inasmuch\n\nas Gonzalez was well aware on June 20 that she was in serious\n\nfinancial straits, her contention that she reasonably expected to\n\nobtain a bank loan within seven days seems suspect at best.   As for\n\nher belated alternative repayment proposal, Gonzalez tendered no\n\nevidence that she possessed artwork with a ready fair-market value\n\napproaching $6,000.    Cf., e.g., Wooten v. Ravkind (In re Dixon),\n\n143 B.R. 671, 675 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 1992) (noting market value of\n\nartwork often \"speculative\").\n\n            With regard to her contention that El Dia displayed an\n\nage-based animus by declining to allow her to repay the $6,000 debt\n\nin installments, Gonzalez cites but one instance in which El Dia\n\never allowed an employee an extension on the original repayment\n\nschedule.    Moreover, in that case the employee was obligated to\n\nrepay a mere $200, mistakenly disbursed by El Dia in the first\n\ninstance, whereas the present record is devoid of any suggestion\n\n\n                                 16\n\fthat El Dia mistakenly disbursed the $6,000 loan to Gonzalez.\n\nAdditionally, after she accepted the advance, Gonzalez knowingly\n\nand    voluntarily     executed      a    written        agreement       specifying       the\n\nrepayment terms.       See Rodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,\n\n181 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"'[A] claim of disparate treatment\n\nbased on comparative evidence must rest on proof that the proposed\n\nanalogue     is    similarly      situated         in   all     material      respects.'\")\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n             Further, Gonzalez asserts that Mr. Mercado demonstrated\n\nan age-based animus, in that his decision to suspend her without\n\npay created a Catch-22; i.e., without a salary she would be unable\n\nto repay the $6,000 and return to work at El Dia, yet her prior\n\nwork   experience     qualified         her    only      for    work     as   a   reporter.\n\nAlternatively,       were   she    to    accept         work    as   a   reporter       for   a\n\ncompeting newspaper she would be in violation of the anti-conflict-\n\nof-interest provision in the CBA. This thesis fails the reasonable\n\nplausibility test as well.\n\n             First, as already noted, Gonzalez claimed that she owned\n\nartwork worth $6,000, which, if sold on the open market, would have\n\nenabled her to repay the $6,000 loan and return to work at El Dia\n\nalmost immediately.         Second, and more importantly, her contention\n\nthat   she   was    qualified      to    work      only    as    a   reporter      is    both\n\nconclusory and without record support.                   That is to say, presumably\n\nan experienced reporter would possess the requisite qualifications\n\n\n                                              17\n\ffor various other positions requiring research and writing skills,\n\nbut would not trigger the narrowly written conflict-of-interest\n\nprovision in the CBA.   See supra Section I.      Yet Gonzalez made no\n\nattempt to demonstrate that no such positions were available in the\n\nrelevant geographic area.\n\n           Accordingly, as it would be overly speculative to infer\n\nan age-based animus from the evidence contained in the record on\n\nappeal, the district court ruling rejecting the Rule 56 proffer by\n\nGonzalez must be affirmed.7\n\nB.   The ADA Claim\n\n           The ADA prescribes that no employer \"shall discriminate\n\nagainst a qualified individual with a disability because of the\n\ndisability of such individual.\"        42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis\n\nadded).   The term \"disability\" is defined as \"a physical or mental\n\nimpairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life\n\nactivities of such individual.\"         Id. \u00a7 12102(2)(A).      Gonzalez\n\ninsists that she tendered enough competent Rule 56 evidence from\n\nwhich the trier of fact might reasonably infer that her various\n\northopedic   conditions,    including    back,   neck   and   leg   pain,\n\nconstitute a \"disability\" which substantially limits her ability to\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      The district court order dismissing the Law 100 claim must be\naffirmed as well, since the merits of the age-discrimination claims\nasserted under the ADEA and Law 100, see 29 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 146-\n151, are coterminous.\n\n                                  18\n\fwork, and that El Dia violated the ADA by failing to make a\n\n\"reasonable accommodation.\"          Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).\n\n            Assuming arguendo that Gonzalez established that her\n\northopedic problems meet the \"physical impairment\" requirement, see\n\nGelabert-Ladenheim v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 252 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir.\n\n2001);    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(i), the remaining issue is whether she\n\nadduced    sufficient    evidence     to        establish   that    her    impairment\n\n\"substantially limits\" her ability to work.                      Although the term\n\n\"substantially limits\" is not defined in the ADA, the related EEOC\n\nregulations define it as either (i) the inability \"to perform a\n\nmajor    life    activity    that    the    average    person      in   the     general\n\npopulation can perform,\" or (ii) being \"[s]ignificantly restricted\n\nas to the condition, manner or duration under which [one] can\n\nperform a       particular   major    life       activity   as     compared     to    the\n\ncondition, manner or duration under which the average person in the\n\ngeneral population can perform that same major life activity.\"                        29\n\nC.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(1); see also Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc.\n\nv. Williams, 534 U.S. 184, 122 S. Ct. 681 (2002).\n\n            The relevant elements to be considered include:                     (i) the\n\nnature or severity of the impairment; (ii) its expected duration;\n\nand     (iii)    its   anticipated     long-term        impact.           See   id.     \u00a7\n\n1630.2(j)(2). Where the major life activity at issue is \"working,\"\n\nadditional factors include:           (i) the geographical area to which\n\nplaintiff has reasonable access; (ii) the number of jobs in that\n\n\n                                           19\n\fgeographical area which require the same abilities as plaintiff's\n\nformer job, but from which plaintiff would be disqualified due to\n\nher impairment; and (iii) the number of jobs in that geographical\n\narea which do not require the same abilities as plaintiff's former\n\njob, but from which plaintiff would be disqualified due to her\n\nimpairment.       See id. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3).\n\n            Evaluated against these standards the Rule 56 proffer\n\npresented by Gonzalez is sparse, to say the least.                    For instance,\n\nshe attests that her impairment made it difficult to walk and\n\nimpossible to sit for extended periods of time.                       Her physician\n\ndiagnosed diabetes and obesity, and determined that after 1995\n\nGonzalez had become \"significantly restricted to (sic) work as\n\ncompared to the average person in the working community and the\n\ncondition,    manner     or     duration    under    which    she     can   work    are\n\nsignificantly restricted.\"              Moreover, her proffer was inadequate\n\nfor the following reasons as well.\n\n            First, Gonzalez tendered no evidence that her impairments\n\nrendered    her    unable       to   perform    a   broad    range    of    jobs,    as\n\ndistinguished from the particular job she held at El Nuevo Dia\n\nimmediately prior to her termination.                See Sutton v. United Air\n\nLines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 492 (1999); Gelabert-Ladenheim, 252 F.3d\n\nat 58-59 (noting that ADA requires an \"individualized inquiry,\" and\n\n\"[w]hen the major life activity of working is at issue . . . the\n\nplaintiff     'assumes      a    more    fact-specific       burden    of   proof'\")\n\n\n                                           20\n\f(citation omitted); 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(3)(i) (same).              Nor did\n\nshe adduce any evidence as to the employment demographics in the\n\nrelevant geographic area, from which a factfinder rationally might\n\nassess the appropriate section 1630.2(j)(3) criteria. Cf. Quint v.\n\nA.E. Staley Mfg. Co., 172 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 1999) (finding that\n\nplaintiff-employee      adduced      sufficient   evidence      of   relevant\n\ndemographics).      The latter omission is especially serious given\n\nGonzalez' testimony that she went to work as a reporter for The San\n\nJuan Star, without providing any indication as to whether she\n\nrequested a reasonable accommodation or The Star acceded to any\n\nsuch request.\n\n              Second, the testimony presented by the treating physician\n\nis   highly    conclusory.     \"It    is   insufficient   for    individuals\n\nattempting to prove disability status . . . to merely submit\n\nevidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.\"           Toyota Motor,\n\n122 S. Ct. at 691; see Sutton, 527 U.S. at 483 (\"'The determination\n\nof whether an individual has a disability is not necessarily based\n\non the name or diagnosis of the impairment.'\") (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\n\n1630.2(j)).      Yet, rather than documenting precisely how Gonzalez'\n\nability to work has been affected by her impairments, the treating\n\nphysician simply parroted the definition of the term \u201csubstantially\n\nlimits\u201d contained in the EEOC regulations, which plainly would not\n\nenable a rational trier of fact to undertake the case-by-case\n\n\n\n\n                                      21\n\fassessment demanded under the ADA.       See Toyota Motor, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n692.       Consequently, the ADA claim was properly dismissed.8\n\nC.     The Statutory Claims Under Puerto Rico Law\n\n               Further, Gonzalez argues on appeal that the district\n\ncourt judgment dismissing her Law 80 \u201cunjust discharge\u201d claim, see\n\n29 P.R. Laws Ann. \u00a7 185a-185m, should be set aside.      Yet, as El Dia\n\npoints out, Gonzalez failed to oppose dismissal of the Law 80 claim\n\nin her opposition to its motion for summary judgment before the\n\ndistrict court.       Consequently, this contention has been waived.\n\nSee Davis v. Lucent Techs., Inc., 251 F.3d 227, 232 (1st Cir.\n\n2001). Moreover, Gonzalez has submitted no reply brief relating to\n\nthe merits of the waiver argument advanced by El Dia on appeal.9\n\n               Even if we were to reach the merits of the Law 80 claim,\n\nhowever, it is extremely doubtful that Gonzalez would fare any\n\nbetter.       After she established by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat she had been discharged, the burden shifted to El Dia to show\n\n\"just cause\" for the dismissal.      See Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola\n\nof P.R. Bottling Co., 152 F.3d 17, 28 (1st Cir. 1998).         Gonzalez\n\n\n\n       8\n      As Gonzalez acknowledges that the Law 44 claim, see 1 P.R.\nLaws Ann. \u00a7 501, is coterminous with her ADA claim, see Acevedo\nLopez v. Police Dep't of P.R., 247 F.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2001), its\ndismissal by the district court must be affirmed as well.\n       9\n      Thus, it is unnecessary to determine whether, in the exercise\nof our discretion, the waiver should be overlooked, given that the\ndistrict court nevertheless reached and determined the matter on\nthe merits in its final judgment. Cf., e.g., Shannon v. Ford Motor\nCo., 72 F.3d 678, 684 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                    22\n\fsuggests that an employer normally may not establish \"just cause\"\n\nwhere the employee was without adequate advance notice of the\n\nconsequences      of   her    actions,         viz.,    constructive   or    actual\n\ndischarge, and that an employee can only be placed on notice once\n\nshe has engaged in a series of infractions.                    See 29 P.R. Laws \u00a7\n\n185b(a) (noting that \"just cause\" may be established where \"the\n\nworker indulge[d] in a pattern of improper or disorderly conduct\");\n\n\u00a7 185b(c) (noting that \"just cause\" may exist where employer can\n\ndemonstrate \"[t]he employee's repeated violations of the reasonable\n\nrules   and    regulations        established     for    the   operation     of   the\n\nestablishment, provided a written copy thereof has been opportunely\n\nfurnished to the employee\"); cf. Alvarez-Fonseca, 152 F.3d at 28.\n\nThis suggestion is flawed as well.\n\n              First,   Law   80    does   not     invariably    require     repeated\n\nviolations, particularly where an initial offense is so serious, or\n\nso reflects upon the employee's character, that the employer\n\nreasonably should not be expected to await further occurrences.\n\nSee Delgado Zayas v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medecina Avanzada, 137\n\nD.P.R. 643, 650 (1994). The conflict-of-interest provision not only\n\ntreats with serious matters relating to employee trustworthiness\n\nand loyalty, but El Dia considered it sufficiently important to\n\ninclude it in the CBA.\n\n              Lastly, Gonzalez ignores the fact that, arguably at\n\nleast, she engaged in a series of infractions.                 She defaulted on a\n\n\n                                          23\n\fpromissory note which she had insisted that Mr. Mercado draw up,\n\nand thereafter deliberately went to work for a competing newspaper\n\nin direct contravention of the CBA.   See Amalgamated Transit Union\n\nv. City of Okla. City, 710 F. Supp. 1321, 1328 (W.D. Okla. 1988)\n\n(presuming employees on notice of all pertinent CBA provisions).\n\nThus, no rational jury reasonably could conclude that El Dia lacked\n\n\"just cause\" to terminate Gonzalez, even if Law 80 did invariably\n\nrequire repeated violations, which it does not.\n\n          Affirmed.

Moreover, Ms. Ferre routinely assigned younger reporters to cover the fashion shows and often told Gonzalez: \"Dona Lydia, I don't know what I'm going to do with you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar remarks were made to Gonzalez by Jorge Mercado, the director of the human resources department, who frequently stated that Gonzalez had \"manias de vieja.\" Moreover, often as Gonzalez arrived at work in the morning, Mr. Mercado would accost her in the lobby and inquire: \"Mom, can I help you?\" or \"What did you come here for, to visit or to request a job?\" In addition, when Mr. Mercado visited the department in which Gonzalez worked, he would make such comments as: \"Are you still here?\" or \"I thought you had been discharged or terminated a long time ago.\" Following a serious work-related injury in April 1997, Gonzalez applied to the State Insurance Fund (SIF) for workers' compensation benefits. The SIF determined that Gonzalez should take medical leave while receiving treatment and rehabilitative therapy. Apparently concerned about Gonzalez' extended absence from work, Ms. Ferre contacted the El Dia human resources department regarding retirement packages which might be offered Gonzalez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, 1997, Gonzalez discussed her health problems and her job with Ms. Ferre. At one point, Ms. Ferre asked Gonzalez whether she would like to retire, adding: \"Look, [ ] you are already 63 years old and your health is not good.\" When Gonzalez responded that she did not wish to retire and instead offered to return to work immediately, Ms. Ferre rejected her offer and advised Gonzalez to take a vacation and return to work on July 1. As Gonzalez had no remaining paid-vacation time, however, and Ms. Ferre was well aware that Gonzalez was in difficult financial straits, Ms. Ferre offered to make an advance on Gonzalez' salary. Gonzalez promptly related the conversation to her former supervisor, Iris Landron. On the following day, El Dia issued a $6,000 check to Gonzalez. Although Gonzalez was surprised by the large amount and concerned about her ability to repay it, she nevertheless applied the entire advance toward her delinquent real estate mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16, Mr. Mercado asked Gonzalez to come to his office, where she was presented with a resignation, release, and compensation agreement. Mr. Mercado asserted that during her June 12 meeting with Ms. Ferre, Gonzalez had agreed to execute these documents. Gonzalez denied any such agreement, refused to sign, and informed Mr. Mercado that she planned to return to work on June 19, rather than July 1. Upon returning to work on June 20, Gonzalez asked Mr. Mercado to draft an agreement, which she then signed, promising to repay the $6,000 advance by June 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 27, Gonzalez and her union representatives met with Mr. Mercado to explain that Gonzalez had been unable to obtain a bank loan with which to repay her $6,000 debt to El Dia. Mr. Mercado rejected Gonzalez' alternative offer either to tender certain valuable artwork in lieu of cash or repay the loan through payroll deductions. After asserting that Gonzalez had breached the repayment agreement in \"bad faith,\" Mr. Mercado suspended her without pay, albeit with benefits (<i>viz., e.g.,</i> health and life insurance), until such time as she repaid the $6,000 advance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Gonzalez was left without a source of income, yet required to mitigate damages, she accepted a position as a staff reporter with The San Juan Star, an El Nuevo Dia competitor, then submitted a grievance against El Dia pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). During the grievance proceeding, Gonzalez admitted to having worked for The San Juan Star. Thereafter, on July 15, 1997, Mr. Mercado terminated Gonzalez, citing the conflict-of-interest provision in the CBA; <i>viz.,</i> \"[r]eporters <i>working</i> for the newspaper shall work exclusively on reporting news for [the newspaper], and thus shall not write articles and/or columns for any newspaper other than [El Nuevo Dia].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> (Emphasis added.) In August 1998, Gonzalez initiated the present action against El Dia, Ms. Ferre, and Mr. Mercado in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, alleging <i>inter alia</i> that her employment had been terminated in violation of the ADEA, the ADA, and various Commonwealth of Puerto Rico statutes. El Dia counterclaimed for its $6,000 advance to Gonzalez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the district court entered summary judgment for El Dia, dismissed all claims in the Gonzalez complaint, and awarded El Dia summary judgment on its counterclaim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On appeal, Gonzalez challenges the district court rulings which presaged the dismissal of her complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment rulings are reviewed de novo, after all the competent evidence and attendant reasonable inferences have been assessed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <i>See Conto,</i> 265 F.3d at 80 n. 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Moreover, rather than weigh the credibility of the testimony, we presume that a rational factfinder would accept it as stated by the witness. <i>See Santiago-Ramos v.

Once this limited burden has been met by the defendant-employer, the presumption which attended the prima facie case vanishes and the claimant must adduce sufficient creditable evidence that age was a motivating factor in the challenged employment action. <i>See id.</i> The plaintiff-employee may meet her burden of proof by showing that the employer's proffered reason for the challenged employment action was pretextual, <i>see id.</i> at 430 n. 5, from which the factfinder in turn may, but need not, infer the alleged discriminatory animus. <i>See Fite v.

Preferred Tech. Group,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761274\"><a href=\"/opinion/761274/regina-r-king-v-preferred-technical-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></a></span>, 893 (7th Cir.1999) (Family and Medical Leave Act) (noting that violation of CBA provision by employee was legitimate nondiscriminatory basis for adverse employment action taken by employer); <i>Burmistrz v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span>, 873-74 (N.D.Ill.2002) (same, under ADA). Accordingly, the burden then shifted back to Gonzalez to prove that the nondiscriminatory basis assertedly relied upon by El Dia was merely a pretext, and that age animus was the real reason for her termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this stage in the proceedings, Gonzalez cannot dispute that she knowingly failed to comply with the pertinent CBA provision, thereby entitling El Dia to discharge her. <i>See Mechnig v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1359</span></span>, 1365 (7th Cir. 1988) (\"[Federal courts] do `not sit as a super-personnel department that reexamines an entity's business decisions.' `No matter how medieval a firm's practices, no matter how high-handed its decisional process, no matter how mistaken the firm's managers, [the ADEA does] not interfere.'\") (citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Accordingly, in order to establish that an age-based animus nonetheless constituted a motivating factor in the decision to terminate her employment, Gonzalez relies principally upon six varieties of evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Ageist Remarks</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez asserts that, prior to June 12, Mr. Mercado and Ms. Ferre engaged in a \"pattern\" of workplace remarks which demonstrate an age-based animus. <i>See supra</i> Section I. Upon closer examination, however, the stray remarks she identified afforded an inadequate foundation for the requisite discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, \"stray workplace remarks,\" as well as statements made either by nondecisionmakers or by decisionmakers not involved in the decisional process, normally are insufficient, standing alone, to establish either pretext or the requisite discriminatory animus. <i>See Straughn v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773251\"><a href=\"/opinion/773251/claire-a-straughn-v-delta-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Laurin v.

The Gonzalez deposition identified neither the time nor the context of the pre-June 12 remarks made by Mr. Mercado and Ms. Ferre, nor could Gonzalez state whether any particular remark had been made at a time proximate either to June 12 or to her July 15 termination. <i>See, e.g., Dominguez-Cruz,</i> 202 F.3d at 433 n. 6 (noting \"circumscribed\" evidentiary weight of \"temporally remote\" statements).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondly, it is far from clear that the alleged remarks bespeak any age-based animus at all. <i>See Fernandes v. Costa Bros. Masonry, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198793\"><a href=\"/opinion/198793/fernandes-v-costa-brothers/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span>, 583 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that \"a statement that plausibly can be interpreted two different ways &#8212; one discriminatory and the other benign &#8212; does not <i>directly</i> reflect illegal animus\") (emphasis added); <i>Speen v.

Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711114\"><a href=\"/opinion/711114/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1752-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43906-pens-plan/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 329 (1st Cir.1996) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some statements, such as those made by Mr. Mercado, merely displayed a measure of surprise that Gonzalez was still employed at El Dia, without either asserting or implying that she was too old to be working. Moreover, Mr. Mercado's alleged use of the salutation \"Mom\" &#8212; though no doubt insensitive, perhaps even rude &#8212; hardly constituted a self-sufficient foundation for an ADEA claim, especially since these particular attributions &#8212; motherhood and advanced age &#8212; plainly are not synonymous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the remarks Ms. Ferre allegedly directed at Gonzalez are reasonably susceptible to interpretation simply as descriptions of the somewhat dowdy appearance and demeanor which Gonzalez herself acknowledges. Moreover, the Spanish phrase \"manias de vieja\" (\"old ways\") did not unambiguously connote that Gonzalez was old, let alone <i>too old,</i> but rather that she acted in ways which did not appear in keeping with a person her age. <i>See, e.g., Pearson v. City of Manhattan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518925\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518925/pearson-v-city-of-manhattan/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span>, 1315 (D.Kan.1999) (holding that phrase \"old ways\" not evidence of ADEA age-based animus, as such terms \"apply more to a person's state of mind than to a person's age\"); <i>Martin v. Ryder Distribution Res., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></span>, 664 (S.D.Fla.1992) (observing that simple references to the plaintiff-employees &#8212; as \"good old boys\" and \"old-fashioned\" &#8212; are insufficient evidence of age-based animus under ADEA), <i>aff'd,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1232</span></span> (11th Cir.1994). Nor did any other statement, attributed either to Mr. Mercado or Ms. Ferre, unambiguously communicate an age-based animus. Rather, their remarks are readily susceptible to interpretations which are in no sense discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Fashion Show Coverage</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly unavailing is the contention that the unexplained refusal to allow Gonzalez to cover fashion shows demonstrated an age-based animus. Given her acknowledged penchant for old-fashioned clothing and hairstyles, it seems much more plausible to attribute El Dia's decision to the fact that Gonzalez was insufficiently attuned to current fashions; and, therefore, that her representation of El Dia at fashion shows could very well reflect adversely upon its business image in such circles. <i>Cf., e.g., Rogosin v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2431140\"><a href=\"/opinion/2431140/rogosin-v-mayor-city-council-of-baltimore/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span>, 351 (D.Md.2002) (noting that employer has right under ADEA to consider plaintiff-employee's projection of \"negative public image\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Ferre-Mercado \"Conspiracy\"</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Gonzalez contends that since Ms. Ferre acknowledges that she contacted Mr. Mercado prior to June 12 in regard to the retirement plan, both should be considered El Dia decisionmakers, and that Ms. Ferre's remark on June 12 &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> \"you are already 63 years old and your health is not good\" &#8212; accordingly constituted a discriminatory statement by a decisionmaker in the context of the adverse employment action taken against her by El Dia. The record on appeal does not square with her contention, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, Ms. Ferre simply stated that she contacted the <i>human resources department</i> prior to June 12 regarding the retirement options available to Gonzalez. There is no record support whatever for the notion that Ms. Ferre stated that she had spoken with <i>Mr. Mercado</i> about the matter. Accordingly, no rational factfinder could construe Ms. Ferre's routine investigation into the retirement options available to Gonzalez as either (i) somehow sinister or (ii) a rational basis for surmising that Ms. Ferre played a meaningful role in Mr. Mercado's subsequent decisions to suspend and terminate Gonzalez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>The Remarks Made by Ms. Ferre on June 12</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 12, Ms. Ferre adverted to Gonzalez' age while the two were discussing Gonzalez' vacation plans and the retirement offer which had been made to her. Of course the mere tender of a retirement proposal does not evince the requisite discriminatory animus. <i>See Baralt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins.

Moreover, even viewed in the light most favorable to Gonzalez, Ms. Ferre's statement plainly conveyed the rational concern that retirement might prove the more prudent course, especially since Gonzalez had been experiencing serious health problems, as well as financial difficulties. <i>See Hoffman v. MCA, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754592\"><a href=\"/opinion/754592/paul-j-hoffman-v-mca-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span>, 1122 (7th Cir.1998) (finding no age-based animus in supervisor's mere observation that employee was \"getting old\"). Nor does Gonzalez contend that she felt pressured to retire by Ms. Ferre's reference to age. <i>Cf. Sempier v.

Rather, the two pertinent employment decisions (<i>viz.,</i> the suspension without pay and the ensuing termination) were made later, precipitated not by Gonzalez' age but by her acknowledged (i) delinquency in repaying the $6,000 advance when due, and (ii) violation of the conflict-of-interest provision in the CBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. <i>The Allegedly False Communication by Ms. Ferre to Mr. Mercado</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Gonzalez stresses that, after June 12, Ms. Ferre falsely informed Mr. Mercado that Gonzalez had accepted the retirement offer, thereby presumably causing the $6,000 check to issue and corroborating Gonzalez' acceptance, all in an elaborate effort to force Gonzalez to leave her employment. Even viewed in the light most favorable to Gonzalez, <i>see Conto,</i> 265 F.3d at 80, n. 1, any such inference would be highly speculative at the very least. We explain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, although at summary judgment we must credit the assertion attributed to Gonzalez on June 12 &#8212; that she never agreed to retire, <i>see Santiago-Ramos,</i> 217 F.3d at 55 &#8212; it does not follow that Ms. Ferre spoke untruthfully. Rather, Ms. Ferre simply may have misinterpreted Gonzalez' stated intentions. But more importantly, we are unable to conceive a plausible motive for Ms. Ferre to misrepresent Gonzalez' intentions. Had Gonzalez not desired or agreed &#8212; on June 12 &#8212; to retire, surely her mere acceptance of the $6,000 loan itself would not have pressured her into executing the retirement agreement, particularly in light of (i) Mr. Mercado's ready acceptance of Gonzalez' own characterization of the June 12 transaction as a loan transaction, and (ii) Mr. Mercado's willingness to accommodate her suggestion that a repayment agreement immediately be reduced to writing. Finally, Gonzalez' characterization of the $6,000 loan, as a mere salary advance, severely strains credulity, especially since she attested that she had been surprised by the large amount of the check and wondered how she would repay it. Accordingly, the record is devoid of creditable evidence that Ms. Ferre, in issuing the $6,000 check to Gonzalez, harbored any illicit motive whatever, let alone an age-based animus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">6. <i>The Suspension Without Pay</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Gonzalez points to Mr. Mercado's rejection of her alternative proposals for repaying the $6,000 loan; <i>i.e.,</i> through payroll deductions or by tendering \"valuable artwork\" in lieu of cash. Mr. Mercado suspended Gonzalez for acting in \"bad faith,\" presumably because she had insisted, a mere seven days earlier, that Mr. Mercado draw up a repayment agreement. Inasmuch as Gonzalez was well aware on June 20 that she was in serious financial straits, her contention that she reasonably expected to obtain a bank loan within seven days seems suspect at best. As for her belated alternative repayment proposal, Gonzalez tendered no evidence that she possessed artwork with a ready fair-market value approaching $6,000. <i>Cf., e.g., Wootton v. Ravkind (In re Dixon),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1836495\"><a href=\"/opinion/1836495/in-re-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 675 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1992) (noting market value of artwork often \"speculative\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to her contention that El Dia displayed an age-based animus by declining to allow her to repay the $6,000 debt in installments, Gonzalez cites but one instance in which El Dia ever allowed an employee an extension on the original repayment schedule. Moreover, in that case the employee was obligated to repay a mere $200, <i>mistakenly disbursed by El Dia</i> in the first instance, whereas the present record is devoid of any suggestion that El Dia mistakenly disbursed the $6,000 loan to Gonzalez. Additionally, after she accepted the advance, Gonzalez knowingly and voluntarily executed a written agreement specifying the repayment terms. <i>See Rodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198515\"><a href=\"/opinion/198515/rodriguez-cuervos-v-wal-mart/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1999) (\"`[A] claim of disparate treatment based on comparative evidence must rest on proof that the proposed analogue is similarly situated in all material respects.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Gonzalez asserts that Mr. Mercado demonstrated an age-based animus, in that his decision to suspend her without pay created a Catch-22; <i>i.e.,</i> without a salary she would be unable to repay the $6,000 and return to work at El Dia, yet her prior work experience qualified her only for work as a reporter. Alternatively, were she to accept work as a reporter for a competing newspaper she would be in violation of the anti-conflict-of-interest provision in the CBA. This thesis fails the reasonable plausibility test as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, as already noted, Gonzalez claimed that she owned artwork worth $6,000, which, if sold on the open market, would have enabled her to repay the $6,000 loan and return to work at El Dia almost immediately. Second, and more importantly, her contention that she was qualified to work only as a reporter is both conclusory and without record support. That is to say, presumably an experienced reporter would possess the requisite qualifications for various other positions requiring research and writing skills, but would not trigger the narrowly written conflict-of-interest provision in the CBA. <i>See supra</i> Section I. Yet Gonzalez made no attempt to demonstrate that no such positions were available in the relevant geographic area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, as it would be overly speculative to infer an age-based animus from the evidence contained in the record on appeal, the district court ruling rejecting the Rule 56 proffer by Gonzalez must be affirmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The ADA Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ADA prescribes that no employer \"shall discriminate against a <i>qualified individual</i> with a disability because of the disability of such individual.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term \"disability\" is defined as \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 12102(2)(A). Gonzalez insists that she tendered enough competent Rule 56 evidence from which the trier of fact might reasonably infer that her various orthopedic conditions, including back, neck and leg pain, constitute a \"disability\" which substantially limits her ability to work, and that El Dia violated the ADA by failing to make a \"reasonable accommodation.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 12112(b)(5)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that Gonzalez established that her orthopedic problems meet the \"physical impairment\" requirement, <i>see Gelabert-Ladenheim v.

Although the term \"substantially limits\" is not defined in the ADA, the related EEOC regulations define it as <i>either</i> (i) the inability \"to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform,\" <i>or</i> (ii) being \"[s]ignificantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which [one] can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(1); <i>see also Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v.

For instance, she attests that her impairment made it difficult to walk and impossible to sit for extended periods of time. Her physician diagnosed diabetes and obesity, and determined that after 1995 Gonzalez had become \"significantly restricted to (sic) work as compared to the average person in the working community and the condition, manner or duration under which she can work are significantly restricted.\" Moreover, her proffer was inadequate for the following reasons as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Gonzalez tendered no evidence that her impairments rendered her unable to perform a broad range of jobs, as distinguished from the particular job she held at El Nuevo Dia immediately prior to her termination. <i>See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 492, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nor did she adduce any evidence as to the employment demographics in the relevant geographic area, from which a factfinder rationally might assess the appropriate section 1630.2(j)(3) criteria. <i>Cf. Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762676\"><a href=\"/opinion/762676/jacquelyn-m-quint-v-ae-staley-manufacturing-company-jacquelyn-m-quint/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 12 (1st Cir.1999) (finding that plaintiff-employee adduced sufficient evidence of relevant demographics). The latter omission is especially serious given Gonzalez' testimony that she went to work as a reporter for The San Juan Star, without providing any indication as to whether she requested a reasonable accommodation or The Star acceded to any such request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the testimony presented by the treating physician is highly conclusory. \"It is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability status ... to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.\" <i>Toyota Motor,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 691; <i>see Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 483, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Yet, rather than documenting precisely how Gonzalez' ability to work has been affected by her impairments, the treating physician simply parroted the definition of the term \"substantially limits\" contained in the EEOC regulations, which plainly would not enable a rational trier of fact to undertake the case-by-case assessment demanded under the ADA. <i>See Toyota Motor,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 692. Consequently, the ADA claim was properly dismissed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Statutory Claims Under Puerto Rico Law</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Gonzalez argues on appeal that the district court judgment dismissing her Law 80 \"unjust discharge\" claim, <i>see</i> 29 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 185a-185m, should be set aside. Yet, as El Dia points out, Gonzalez failed to oppose dismissal of the Law 80 claim in her opposition to its motion for summary judgment before the district court. Consequently, this contention has been waived. <i>See Davis v. Lucent Techs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199416\"><a href=\"/opinion/199416/davis-v-lucent-technologies/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></a></span>, 232 (1st Cir.2001). Moreover, Gonzalez has submitted no reply brief relating to the merits of the waiver argument advanced by El Dia on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to reach the merits of the Law 80 claim, however, it is extremely doubtful that Gonzalez would fare any better. After she established by a preponderance of the evidence that she had been discharged, the burden shifted to El Dia to show \"just cause\" for the dismissal. <i>See Alvarez-Fonseca v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757019\"><a href=\"/opinion/757019/78-fair-emplpraccas-bna-459-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45560-jose-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.1998). Gonzalez suggests that an employer normally may not establish \"just cause\" where the employee was without adequate advance notice of the consequences of her actions, viz., constructive or actual discharge, and that an employee can only be placed on notice once she has engaged in a series of infractions. <i>See</i> 29 P.R. Laws &#167; 185b(a) (noting that \"just cause\" may be established where \"the worker indulge[d] in a pattern of improper or disorderly conduct\"); &#167; 185b(c) (noting that \"just cause\" may exist where employer can demonstrate \"[t]he employee's repeated violations of the reasonable rules and regulations established for the operation of the establishment, provided a written copy thereof has been opportunely furnished to the employee\"); <i>cf. Alvarez-Fonseca,</i> 152 F.3d at 28. This suggestion is flawed as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Law 80 does not invariably require repeated violations, particularly where an initial offense is so serious, or so reflects upon the employee's character, that the employer reasonably should not be expected to await further occurrences. <i>See Delgado Zayas v. Hosp. Interamericano de Medicina Avanzada,</i> 137 D.P.R. 643, 650 (1994). The conflict-of-interest provision not only treats with serious matters relating to employee trustworthiness and loyalty, but El Dia considered it sufficiently important to include it in the CBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, Gonzalez ignores the fact that, arguably at least, she engaged in a <i>series of infractions.</i> She defaulted on a promissory note which she had insisted that Mr. Mercado draw up, and thereafter deliberately went to work for a competing newspaper in direct contravention of the CBA. <i>See Amalgamated Transit Union v. City of Okla. City,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1462987\"><a href=\"/opinion/1462987/amalgamated-transit-union-v-city-of-oklahoma-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1321</span></a></span>, 1328 (W.D.Okla.1988) (presuming employees on notice of all pertinent CBA provisions). Thus, no rational jury reasonably could conclude that El Dia lacked \"just cause\" to terminate Gonzalez, even if Law 80 did invariably require repeated violations, which it does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.
