We need not repeat the details of appellants\u2019 claims here as they are well-\n\nknown to the parties and are summarized in the District Court\u2019s memorandum. For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n       We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We exercise\n\nplenary review over a district court\u2019s order of summary judgment. See Kaucher v.\n\nCounty of Bucks, 455 F.3d 418, 422 (3d Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is proper if there\n\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law. Id. at 422-423. An issue is genuine only if there is a sufficient\n\nevidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find for the non-moving party, and a\n\nfactual dispute is material only if it might affect the outcome of the suit under governing\n\nlaw. Id. at 423 (citing Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)). In\n\nconducting our review, we view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving\n\nparties and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor. Id.\n\n       On appeal, Margaret Crawford contends that the District Court erred in concluding\n\n\n\n\n   1\n     Appellants were represented by counsel before the District Court, but are appealing\npro se. Plaintiff Larhonda Batzel is not participating in this appeal.\n\n                                              2\n\fthat her malicious prosecution claim against defendants Croft and Staskiewicz was time-\n\nbarred. The applicable statute of limitations for Margaret Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim is that\n\ngoverning personal injury claims in Pennsylvania. See Wallace v. Kato, --- U.S. ----, 127\n\nS.Ct. 1091, 1094, (2007); see also Urrutia v. Harrisburg County Police Dep\u2019t, 91 F.3d\n\n451, 457 n. 9 (3d Cir.1996). Therefore, Margaret Crawford had two years from the time\n\nher cause of action accrued in which to file her complaint. See Urrutia, 91 F.3d at 457 n.\n\n9. The statute of limitations on malicious prosecution claims \u201cdoes not begin to run until\n\nthe underlying criminal proceedings are terminated in plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d Rose v. Bartle,\n\n871 F.2d 331, 348 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n       We agree with the District Court that there is no genuine issue of material fact to\n\nchallenge a conclusion that the charges against Margaret Crawford were dismissed on\n\nJanuary 28, 2003. Accordingly, Margaret Crawford was required to file her complaint no\n\nlater than January 28, 2005, but failed to do so until February 1, 2005. Accordingly, the\n\nDistrict Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants Croft and\n\nStaskiewicz.\n\n       Summary judgment was also properly granted in favor of defendant Erdely with\n\nrespect to William Crawford\u2019s claim that Erdely deprived him of his property (his\n\npersonal computer) by damaging it and retaining it \u201cfor no just or proper reason without\n\ndue process of law.\u201d Summary judgment was properly entered in favor of Erdely\n\nbecause, as explained by the District Court, William Crawford\u2019s response to Erdely\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fmotion for summary judgment provided no record support for his position that the\n\ncomputer had been damaged or improperly retained. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\n\nU.S. 317, 324 (1986) (nonmoving party may not rest on allegations in the complaint but\n\nmust \u201cgo beyond the pleadings and by [his] own affidavits, or by the depositions, answers\n\nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, designate specific facts showing that there is a\n\ngenuine issue for trial.\u201d) (quotation omitted). See also Berckeley Inv. Group. Ltd. v.\n\nColkitt, 455 F.3d 195, 201 (3d Cir. 2006) (\u201c[S]ummary judgment is essentially \u2018put up or\n\nshut up\u2019 time for the non-moving party: the non-moving party must rebut the motion with\n\nfacts in the record and cannot rest solely on assertions made in the pleadings, legal\n\nmemoranda, or oral argument.\u201d)\n\n       Appellant Murphy\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment\n\nin favor of defendant Bock is likewise without merit. On appeal, Murphy argues for the\n\nfirst time that Bock violated his Fourth Amendment rights because Bock took and\n\nretained Murphy\u2019s personal property without a warrant. We decline to address this\n\nargument. See In re Tower Air, Inc., 416 F.3d 229, 242 (3d Cir. 2005). To the extent\n\nMurphy is attempting to challenge the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on his\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process claim, we conclude that summary judgment was\n\nproperly entered in favor of Bock. In the District Court, Murphy argued that Bock had no\n\nauthority to decide who owned the property Murphy left in his office after his suspension,\n\nand deprived Murphy of his property \u201cwithout due process of law\u201d when Bock \u201ccarried\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\faway numerous items of personal property\u201d to be used by the PSP \u201cfor museum and\n\nmemorabilia collections.\u201d Even assuming arguendo that all of the disputed items left in\n\nMurphy\u2019s office in fact belonged to Murphy, and that he had a property interest\n\nimplicating the due process clause, no violation of due process has occurred. Where, as\n\nhere, the complained of conduct is \u201crandom and unauthorized,\u201d2 post-deprivation process\n\nis all that is due. Brown v. Muhlenberg, 269 F.3d 205 (3d Cir. 2001). The\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania provides an adequate post-deprivation process for\n\nMurphy: the judicial remedy of a civil action for conversion. Further, the parties do not\n\ndispute that PSP\u2019s Internal Affairs Division has already investigated a complaint brought\n\nby Murphy against Bock concerning the loss of or damage to Murphy\u2019s personal property.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we conclude that summary judgment was properly entered\n\nagainst Murphy on his due process claim.3\n\n       Finally, the District Court properly entered summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendant Miller. Murphy failed to demonstrate that Miller was personally involved with\n\nthe alleged taking of, and damage to, his property. See Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d\n\n\n   2\n     We conclude that Bock\u2019s actions were \u201crandom and unauthorized\u201d as a matter of\nlaw because Murphy\u2019s opposition to the summary judgment motion failed to point to any\nevidence in the record that highly placed PSP employees \u201ccondoned and ratified\u201d the\nalleged stealing and retention of his PSP memorabilia. Indeed, as stated by the District\nCourt, Murphy attested that he had no \u201chard fact evidence\u201d to support his suspicion that\nBock was improperly motivated to take his memorabilia for use in a PSP collection.\n   3\n     Because we conclude that Murphy failed to show that Bock deprived him of a\nconstitutional right, we need not reach the question of whether Bock would be entitled to\nqualified immunity. Kaucher, 455 F.3d at 423 n. 2.\n\n                                             5\n\f1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1998).\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                                                                                           Opinions of the United\n2008 Decisions                                                                                                             States Court of Appeals\n                                                                                                                              for the Third Circuit\n\n\n3-20-2008\n\nCrawford v.

Accordingly, Margaret Crawford was required to file her complaint no\n\nlater than January 28, 2005, but failed to do so until February 1, 2005. Accordingly, the\n\nDistrict Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants Croft and\n\nStaskiewicz.\n\n       Summary judgment was also properly granted in favor of defendant Erdely with\n\nrespect to William Crawford\u2019s claim that Erdely deprived him of his property (his\n\npersonal computer) by damaging it and retaining it \u201cfor no just or proper reason without\n\ndue process of law.\u201d Summary judgment was properly entered in favor of Erdely\n\nbecause, as explained by the District Court, William Crawford\u2019s response to Erdely\u2019s\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fmotion for summary judgment provided no record support for his position that the\n\ncomputer had been damaged or improperly retained.

On appeal, Murphy argues for the\n\nfirst time that Bock violated his Fourth Amendment rights because Bock took and\n\nretained Murphy\u2019s personal property without a warrant. We decline to address this\n\nargument. See In re Tower Air, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791140\"><a href=\"/opinion/791140/in-re-tower-air-inc-debtor-charles-a-stanziale-in-his-capacity-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (3d Cir. 2005). To the extent\n\nMurphy is attempting to challenge the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on his\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process claim, we conclude that summary judgment was\n\nproperly entered in favor of Bock. In the District Court, Murphy argued that Bock had no\n\nauthority to decide who owned the property Murphy left in his office after his suspension,\n\nand deprived Murphy of his property \u201cwithout due process of law\u201d when Bock \u201ccarried\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\faway numerous items of personal property\u201d to be used by the PSP \u201cfor museum and\n\nmemorabilia collections.\u201d Even assuming arguendo that all of the disputed items left in\n\nMurphy\u2019s office in fact belonged to Murphy, and that he had a property interest\n\nimplicating the due process clause, no violation of due process has occurred. Where, as\n\nhere, the complained of conduct is \u201crandom and unauthorized,\u201d2 post-deprivation process\n\nis all that is due. Brown v. Muhlenberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775324\"><a href=\"/opinion/775324/kim-brown-david-brown-hw-v-muhlenberg-township-board-of-supervisors-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2001). The\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania provides an adequate post-deprivation process for\n\nMurphy: the judicial remedy of a civil action for conversion. Further, the parties do not\n\ndispute that PSP\u2019s Internal Affairs Division has already investigated a complaint brought\n\nby Murphy against Bock concerning the loss of or damage to Murphy\u2019s personal property.\n\nUnder these circumstances, we conclude that summary judgment was properly entered\n\nagainst Murphy on his due process claim.3\n\n       Finally, the District Court properly entered summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendant Miller. Murphy failed to demonstrate that Miller was personally involved with\n\nthe alleged taking of, and damage to, his property. See Rode v. Dellarciprete, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n\n   <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n     We conclude that Bock\u2019s actions were \u201crandom and unauthorized\u201d as a matter of\nlaw because Murphy\u2019s opposition to the summary judgment motion failed to point to any\nevidence in the record that highly placed PSP employees \u201ccondoned and ratified\u201d the\nalleged stealing and retention of his PSP memorabilia. Indeed, as stated by the District\nCourt, Murphy attested that he had no \u201chard fact evidence\u201d to support his suspicion that\nBock was improperly motivated to take his memorabilia for use in a PSP collection.\n   3\n     Because we conclude that Murphy failed to show that Bock deprived him of a\nconstitutional right, we need not reach the question of whether Bock would be entitled to\nqualified immunity.
