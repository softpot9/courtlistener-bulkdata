The structure on the property was a\n\nVictorian, two-and-a-half story, red brick house. The property had previously been\n\nzoned as a \u201cPB-3, custom draperies and resale shop\u201d. Appellant Fair wanted to operate\n\na salon/spa business on the property so she applied for a planned district zone change\n\nto a \u201cPB-3, beauty salon and day spa.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 3} On October 29, 2001, Canton City Council approved the planned district\n\nzoning change.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} Appellant Total Image, LLC obtained a $65,000 loan from the Canton\n\nCommunity Improvement Corporation to remodel the property and purchase equipment,\n\nthen opened a full-service salon and spa, offering massage, skin care, nails and\n\npedicures and full hair service.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} Appellant Fair operated Total Image at that location until early 2009 when\n\nit defaulted on its loan and closed its doors.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On two occasions prior to the closing of Total Image, once in 2005 and\n\nagain in 2008, Appellant was approached by a real estate developer whose client\n\nwanted to build a Walgreen\u2019s drugstore at that location.    Appellant entered into an\n\nagreement, contingent on the developer\u2019s client\u2019s ability to purchase the surrounding\n\fStark County, Case No. 2011 CA 00132                                                   3\n\n\nproperties and obtain the necessary zoning change from the current PB-3 to a General\n\nBusiness District, B-3.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} In 2006, Appellant Tammy Fair attempted to gain approval to change her\n\nparcel from \"PB-3\" to \u201cB-3\u201d so that she could close on an offer to purchase the property\n\nbut was unsuccessful.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} In 2008, the developer again approached Appellant Fair with a similar\n\noffer to purchase, but Fair was again unsuccessful in her attempts of obtain the change\n\nin zoning.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} On January 18, 2011, Appellant Fair filed a Complaint with Stark County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment that the City of Canton\u2019s\n\nordinances regarding \u201cPlanned\u201d zoning districts is unconstitutional and further seeking a\n\nwrit of mandamus compelling the City of Canton to commence an action and\n\ncompensate her for the taking of her property without just compensation.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} On May 9, 2011, Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment on all\n\nissues.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} On May 23, 2011, Appellants filed a response to Appellee\u2019s motion for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} By Judgment Entry filed June 8, 2011, the trial court granted Appellee City\n\nof Canton\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, finding that the City of Canton\u2019s zoning\n\nordinance is \u201cconstitutional on its face and as applied to Fair as it bears a rational\n\nrelationship to a legitimate regulatory purpose.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 13} Appellants assign the following errors for review:\n\fStark County, Case No. 2011 CA 00132                                                4\n\n\n                                ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n       {\u00b6 14} \u201cI. THE COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW IN FINDING THAT THE\n\nORDINANCE IS CONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE AND AS APPLIED TO\n\nPLAINTIFF\u2019S     PROPERTY       BECAUSE       IT   IS   ARBITRARY,      CAPRICIOUS,\n\nUNREASONABLE, CONFISCATORY.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} \u201cII. THE COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW IN FINDING THAT THE\n\nORDINANCE IS CONSTITUTIONAL ON ITS FACE AND AS APPLIED TO\n\nPLAINTIFF\u2019S PROPERTY BECAUSE IT VIOLATES THE EQUAL PROTECTION\n\nCLAUSE OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} \u201cIII. THE COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW IN NOT FINDING\n\nTHAT     THE    ORDINANCE       CONSTITUTES        A   TAKING      WITHOUT      JUST\n\nCOMPENSATION, AND GRANTING SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO DEFENDANT CITY\n\nOF CANTON ON THIS ISSUE.\u201d\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       {\u00b6 17} We will first address the standard of review applicable to Appellants'\n\nAssignments of Error.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Summary Judgment motions are to be resolved in light of the dictates of\n\nCiv.R. 56. Said rule was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in State ex rel.\n\nZimmerman v. Tompkins, 75 Ohio St.3d 447, 448, 663 N.E.2d 639, 1996-Ohio-211:\n\n       {\u00b6 19} \u201cCiv.R. 56(C) provides that before summary judgment may be granted, it\n\nmust be determined that (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be\n\nlitigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it\n\nappears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and\n\fStark County, Case No. 2011 CA 00132                                                     5\n\n\nviewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is\n\nadverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. State ex\n\nrel. Parsons v. Fleming (1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 509, 511, 628 N.E.2d 1377, 1379, citing\n\nTemple v. Wean United, Inc. (1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O3d 466, 472, 364\n\nN.E.2d 267, 274.\u201d\n\n      {\u00b6 20} As an appellate court reviewing summary judgment motions, we must\n\nstand in the shoes of the trial court and review summary judgments on the same\n\nstandard and evidence as the trial court. Smiddy v. The Wedding Party, Inc. (1987), 30\n\nOhio St.3d 35, 506 N.E.2d 212.\n\n                                          I., III.\n\n      {\u00b6 21} In their first and third assignments of error, Appellants claim that the trial\n\ncourt erred in not finding that the Canton City Ordinance is unconstitutional both on its\n\nface and as applied and that such zoning is not an unconstitutional taking of her\n\nproperty without just compensation. We disagree.\n\n      {\u00b6 22} We begin our analysis of Appellants\u2019 challenge to the Canton City\n\nOrdinance by recognizing that zoning ordinances are presumed to be constitutional.\n\nGoldberg Cos., Inc. v. Richmond Hts. City Council (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 207, 209;\n\nState v. Dorso (1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 60, 61, 446 N.E.2d 449. Courts must apply \u201call\n\npresumptions and pertinent rules of construction so as to uphold, if at all possible, a\n\nstatute or ordinance assailed as unconstitutional.\u201d Id. A court should not declare a\n\nlegislative enactment unconstitutional if there is a rational interpretation that would\n\npreserve its constitutionality. State v. Sinito (1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 98, 101, 330 N.E.2d\n\n896. Zoning ordinances are presumed constitutional unless a court determines that the\n\fStark County, Case No. 2011 CA 00132                                                   6\n\n\nordinance is \u201cclearly arbitrary and unreasonable and without substantial relation to the\n\npublic health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community.\u201d Goldberg Cos., Inc.\n\nv. Richmond Hts. City Council (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 207, 214, 690 N.E.2d 510.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} In order to invalidate a zoning ordinance, the challenging party must\n\ndemonstrate, beyond fair debate, that the zoning classification is \u201c\u2018arbitrary and\n\nunreasonable, having no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or\n\ngeneral welfare.\u2019\u201c Id. at 210. (Citation omitted.) The \u201cbeyond fair debate\u201d standard is\n\nsimilar to the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in the context of a criminal\n\ntrial. Heritage Dev. Co., LLC v. Willoughby Hills, 11th Dist. No. 2001-L-221, 2002-Ohio-\n\n7269, at \u00b6 17. (Citation omitted.)\n\n       {\u00b6 24} In the context of this case, Appellants are raising two types of challenges\n\nto the zoning ordinance: a facial challenge and an as-applied challenge.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} A zoning ordinance can be challenged on its face or on the particular set\n\nof facts to which the statute has been applied. Harold v. Collier, 107 Ohio St.3d 44,\n\n2005-Ohio-5334, 836 N.E.2d 1165, \u00b6 37, citing Belden v. Union Cent. Life Ins.\n\nCo. (1944), 143 Ohio St. 329, 28 O.O. 295, 55 N.E.2d 629, paragraph four of the\n\nsyllabus. When a statute is challenged on its face, the challenger must demonstrate that\n\nno set of circumstances exists under which the statute would be valid. Id., citing United\n\nStates v. Salerno (1987), 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697.

We find that such ordinance is rationally related to\n\nencourage the economic stability and growth while protecting the stability and\n\npreservation of residential neighborhoods.\n\n       {\u00b6 36} As such, we do not find such ordinance to be unconstitutional on its face.\n\n                                   As-applied Challenge\n\n       {\u00b6 37} In Jaylin, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio reiterated the appropriate\n\nanalysis to employ when considering whether a zoning ordinance is constitutional, as\n\napplied to a property owner.\n\n       {\u00b6 38} \u201cIn a constitutional analysis, the object of scrutiny is the legislative action.\n\nThe zoning ordinance is the focal point of the analysis, not the property owner's\n\nproposed use, and the analysis begins with a presumption that the ordinance is\n\nconstitutional. The analysis focuses on the legislative judgment underlying the\n\nenactment, as it is applied to the particular property, not the municipality's failure to\n\napprove what the owner suggests may be a better use of the property. If application of\n\fStark County, Case No. 2011 CA 00132                                                       9\n\n\nthe zoning ordinance prevents an owner from using the property in a particular way, the\n\nproposed use is relevant but only as one factor to be considered in analyzing the zoning\n\nordinance's application to the particular property at issue.\u201d Jaylin, 107 Ohio St.3d 339, at\n\n\u00b6 18.\n\n        {\u00b6 39} \u201cIn an \u2018as applied\u2019 challenge to a zoning ordinance, the landowner\n\nquestions the validity of the ordinance only as it applies to a particular parcel of\n\nproperty.

Appellant Fair wanted to operate\n\na salon/spa business on the property so she applied for a planned district zone change\n\nto a \u201cPB-3, beauty salon and day spa.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 3} On October 29, 2001, Canton City Council approved the planned district\n\nzoning change.\n\n       {\u00b6 4} Appellant Total Image, LLC obtained a $65,000 loan from the Canton\n\nCommunity Improvement Corporation to remodel the property and purchase equipment,\n\nthen opened a full-service salon and spa, offering massage, skin care, nails and\n\npedicures and full hair service.\n\n       {\u00b6 5} Appellant Fair operated Total Image at that location until early 2009 when\n\nit defaulted on its loan and closed its doors.\n\n       {\u00b6 6} On two occasions prior to the closing of Total Image, once in 2005 and\n\nagain in 2008, Appellant was approached by a real estate developer whose client\n\nwanted to build a Walgreen\u2019s drugstore at that location.    Appellant entered into an\n\nagreement, contingent on the developer\u2019s client\u2019s ability to purchase the surrounding\n\fStark County, Case No. 2011 CA 00132                                                   3\n\n\nproperties and obtain the necessary zoning change from the current PB-3 to a General\n\nBusiness District, B-3.\n\n       {\u00b6 7} In 2006, Appellant Tammy Fair attempted to gain approval to change her\n\nparcel from \"PB-3\" to \u201cB-3\u201d so that she could close on an offer to purchase the property\n\nbut was unsuccessful.\n\n       {\u00b6 8} In 2008, the developer again approached Appellant Fair with a similar\n\noffer to purchase, but Fair was again unsuccessful in her attempts of obtain the change\n\nin zoning.\n\n       {\u00b6 9} On January 18, 2011, Appellant Fair filed a Complaint with Stark County\n\nCourt of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment that the City of Canton\u2019s\n\nordinances regarding \u201cPlanned\u201d zoning districts is unconstitutional and further seeking a\n\nwrit of mandamus compelling the City of Canton to commence an action and\n\ncompensate her for the taking of her property without just compensation.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} On May 9, 2011, Appellee filed a motion for summary judgment on all\n\nissues.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} On May 23, 2011, Appellants filed a response to Appellee\u2019s motion for\n\nsummary judgment.\n\n       {\u00b6 12} By Judgment Entry filed June 8, 2011, the trial court granted Appellee City\n\nof Canton\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, finding that the City of Canton\u2019s zoning\n\nordinance is \u201cconstitutional on its face and as applied to Fair as it bears a rational\n\nrelationship to a legitimate regulatory purpose.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 13} Appellants assign the following errors for review:\n\fStark County, Case No. 2011 CA 00132                                                4\n\n\n                                ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n       {\u00b6 14} \u201cI.
