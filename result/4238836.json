He asserts\n\n      that the order violated his due process rights and that the trial court erred by\n\n      executing the entirety of his suspended sentences with the Indiana Department\n\n      of Correction (DOC). Finding no due process violation and no error, we\n\n      affirm.\n\n\n                                                     Facts\n[2]   On September 4, 2012, the State charged Novak with Class A felony possession\n\n      of a narcotic drug. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, on January 10, 2013,\n\n      Novak pleaded guilty to Class B felony possession of a narcotic drug.\n\n      Following a February 21, 2013, sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced\n\n      him to six years, with three years executed in the DOC, one year in work\n\n      release, one year on electronic monitoring, and one year suspended to\n\n      probation.\n\n\n[3]   On November 2, 2012, in an unrelated cause, Novak was charged with Class A\n\n      and B felony dealing in a Schedule I controlled substance. On April 26, 2013,\n\n      pursuant to another written plea agreement, the State dismissed the Class A\n\n      felony charge and Novak pleaded guilty to Class B felony dealing in a Schedule\n\n      I controlled substance. On the same day, the trial court sentenced him to six\n\n      years, with two years suspended to probation and the executed portion to be\n\n      served consecutively to his first sentence. Under the terms of Novak\u2019s\n\n      probation for both causes, he was not permitted to travel outside Indiana\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 2 of 9\n\f      without an order from the trial court; he was not permitted to use, purchase, or\n\n      possess illegal drugs; and he was required to submit to alcohol and drug tests.\n\n\n[4]   On April 4, 2014, Novak filed a motion to modify his sentence under the\n\n      second cause and, on August 1, 2014, the trial court granted the motion and\n\n      modified the remainder of the executed portion of his sentence to work release,\n\n      beginning December 7, 2014. On April 13, 2015, LaPorte County Community\n\n      Corrections filed a petition to revoke Novak\u2019s placement, alleging that on three\n\n      occasions in March 2015, he failed to report to work or return to the work\n\n      release center. On July 14, 2015, after admitting to the violations at a hearing,\n\n      Novak was sentenced to six months in the LaPorte County Jail. After serving\n\n      that time, he returned to work release.\n\n\n[5]   On November 10, 2015, Novak was asked to submit to a drug test, and he\n\n      admitted that it would likely come back positive for heroin and prescription\n\n      drugs. Novak tested positive for heroin. On December 2 and 9, 2015, the\n\n      probation department filed petitions to revoke Novak\u2019s suspended sentences\n\n      under the second and first causes, respectively. On January 15, 2016, the trial\n\n      court held a hearing on both petitions and issued a bond order, releasing Novak\n\n      on his own recognizance and ordering him to report to probation and a\n\n      program aimed at helping those with substance abuse problems. On the same\n\n      day, Novak was referred to the Swanson Center and he completed his intake\n\n      there. His probation officer testified that, besides his intake, she had not\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 3 of 9\n\f      received any confirmation that he had attended classes or otherwise completed\n\n      the program.1 Tr. Vol. III p. 7, 11-13.\n\n\n[6]   On March 21, 2016, Novak submitted to another drug test, which was positive\n\n      for amphetamines; consequently, on April 5, 2016, the probation department\n\n      filed a second petition to revoke under the second cause and, on April 15, 2016,\n\n      the trial court issued a warrant for his arrest.\n\n\n[7]   After learning about the warrant and without contacting anyone, Novak\n\n      absconded to Texas. In April 2017, Novak was arrested in Texas and\n\n      extradited to Indiana. On May 26, 2017, the probation department filed a third\n\n      petition to revoke under both causes, alleging that Novak had left the state\n\n      without a trial court order.\n\n\n[8]   On June 8, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on the petitions. At the hearing,\n\n      Novak testified that he had a substance abuse problem and admitted that he had\n\n      used heroin and amphetamines and left the state without an order from the trial\n\n      court. Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 8. After hearing testimony from Novak and his\n\n      probation officer, the trial court found that he had violated the terms of his\n\n      probation for \u201cnot cooperating fully with Swanson Center, by missing\n\n      probation appointment meetings, by absconding to the State of Texas . . . , and\n\n      by testing positive for drugs while on probation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. Vol. II p.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       She also testified that Novak failed to attend two scheduled probation appointments on December 4 and 15,\n      2015. Tr. Vol. III p. 10.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018        Page 4 of 9\n\f       233. The trial court also noted that Novak failed to take advantage of his\n\n       sentence modification and that the court believed that a \u201cstructured\n\n       environment\u201d was the \u201cbest defense against further relapses.\u201d Tr. Vol. III p. 27.\n\n       Accordingly, the trial court revoked Novak\u2019s probation in both causes and\n\n       ordered him to serve the remainder of the suspended portions of his sentences\u2014\n\n       a total of three years\u2014with the DOC. Novak now appeals.\n\n\n                                    Discussion and Decision\n                                             I. Due Process\n[9]    First, Novak contends that the trial court violated his due process rights. It is\n\n       well established that \u201cprobationers are not entitled to the full array of\n\n       constitutional rights afforded defendants at trial.\u201d Lightcap v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094996\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094996/lightcap-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n       <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 910 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007). However, among other things, a probationer is\n\n       entitled to written notice of the alleged violation. Wann v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n       <span class=\"page\">1103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1105 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013).\n\n\n[10]   Novak contends that two of the bases upon which the trial court relied\u2014the\n\n       failure to cooperate with Swanson Center and missing probation appointment\n\n       meetings\u2014were not listed in the petitions to revoke; he argues that,\n\n       consequently, he never received written notice of these violations and that it\n\n       was improper for the trial court to base its decision on them.\n\n\n[11]   A court may revoke a defendant\u2019s probation if \u201cthe person has violated a\n\n       condition of probation during the probationary period\u201d and the petition to\n\n       revoke was timely filed. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2-3(a). We have found the lack of\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 5 of 9\n\f       notice on one probation violation harmless when the probationer is found to\n\n       have violated another condition of probation where adequate notice was\n\n       provided. E.g., Bussberg v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2092079\"><a href=\"/opinion/2092079/bussberg-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005).\n\n\n[12]   In this case, it is undisputed that the terms of Novak\u2019s probation did not permit\n\n       him to use drugs or leave the state without an order from the trial court. It is\n\n       also undisputed that the petitions to revoke expressly identified these\n\n       conditions. Appellant\u2019s App. Vol. II p. 46, 187, 217. Further, Novak admitted\n\n       to taking heroin and amphetamines and leaving the state without an order from\n\n       the trial court. Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 8. Thus, even if Novak did not receive notice\n\n       of the other violations, because he admitted to violations for which he received\n\n       written notice, any error was harmless. See Bussberg, 827 N.E.2d at 44.\n\n\n[13]   Novak argues that the failure to provide written notice on these two grounds\n\n       was not harmless because the trial court was particularly \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the\n\n       allegations and, consequently, put undue emphasis on these violations.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 12. He notes that the two bases at issue were the first on the\n\n       order and that the trial court specifically questioned the probation officer about\n\n       these offenses. He speculates that the trial court may not have sentenced him to\n\n       the entirety of his suspended sentences had evidence of these violations not\n\n       been admitted. He also insists that the lack of notice compromised his ability to\n\n       put up a defense, because he was not prepared to prove exactly how many\n\n       classes he had attended at Swanson Center.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 6 of 9\n\f[14]   We find little merit in Novak\u2019s arguments. Novak cites to no portion of the\n\n       record nor do we find any that suggests that the trial court was particularly\n\n       fixated on Novak\u2019s alleged non-compliance with Swanson Center or missed\n\n       probation appointments. In any event, there is no prejudice to Novak with\n\n       respect to the Swanson Center because he admitted that he stopped attending\n\n       the classes altogether after he absconded to Texas.\n\n\n[15]   In sum, because Novak admitted to violations for which he received adequate\n\n       written notice, the trial court\u2019s order did not violate his due process rights.\n\n\n                                II. Placement with the DOC\n[16]   Next, Novak contends that the trial court erred by executing the balance of his\n\n       suspended sentences. Probation is a matter of grace left to the trial court\u2019s\n\n       discretion rather than a right to which a defendant is entitled, and we will not\n\n       reverse the trial court\u2019s decision unless the decision is clearly against the logic\n\n       and effect of the facts and circumstances. Prewitt v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"852509\"><a href=\"/opinion/852509/prewitt-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188\n\n       (Ind. 2007). A trial court may revoke a defendant\u2019s probation for violation of a\n\n       single condition of his probation, e.g., Pierce v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755 (Ind.\n\n       Ct. App. 2015), and, once a violation is found, the trial court may execute all or\n\n       part of a suspended sentence, I.C. \u00a7 35-38-2-3(h)(3).\n\n\n[17]   Here, Novak admitted to violating his probation three times, but nonetheless\n\n       argues that the trial court erred and was excessively harsh when it executed the\n\n       suspended portions of his sentences. He emphasizes that this was the most\n\n       severe choice available, that it was the first time his probation had been\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 7 of 9\n\f       revoked, and that the trial court heavily relied on the bases for which he claims\n\n       he received deficient notice. He also claims that the decision is unduly severe\n\n       because his positive test for amphetamines was the result of a mistake and\n\n       because he went to Texas to see previously unmet family. We find his\n\n       arguments unpersuasive.\n\n\n[18]   Initially, we note that the trial court repeatedly provided Novak with leniency.\n\n       First, the trial court placed him on work release early by modifying his\n\n       sentence. Despite this opportunity, just months after this placement, he\n\n       violated its terms by failing to report to work or the work release center on three\n\n       occasions. Still, the trial court only sentenced Novak to six months in jail and\n\n       allowed him to return to work release afterwards. Novak squandered this\n\n       chance as well by testing positive for heroin; yet, in its bond order, the trial\n\n       court released Novak on his own recognizance and referred him to a program\n\n       aimed at helping those with substance abuse problems to get the help he\n\n       needed. However, Novak then fled to Texas after his positive test for\n\n       amphetamines.\n\n\n[19]   Further, Novak admitted that he was drug-free while in the DOC but that,\n\n       within two months of his placement with community corrections, he had tested\n\n       positive for heroin, supporting the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Novak\u2019s sobriety\n\n       will be best served in the DOC. And Novak admitted that he made a calculated\n\n       decision to abscond to Texas because he was scared and embarrassed of the\n\n       situation and he has offered no reason why his family reunion prevented him\n\n       from contacting probation or the court for the better part of a year.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 8 of 9\n\f[20]   In sum, because Novak admitted to taking drugs and leaving the state while on\n\n       probation, the trial court did not err by revoking his probation. Furthermore,\n\n       considering the trial court\u2019s repeated attempts to provide leniency, Novak\u2019s\n\n       continued failure to take advantage of these opportunities, and his most recent\n\n       decision to abscond to Texas for the better part of a year, we cannot say that the\n\n       trial court\u2019s decision to execute the suspended portions of his sentences with the\n\n       DOC was clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances.\n\n\n[21]   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n       Riley, J., and Brown, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 9 of 9\n\f</pre>", "Case_Text": "MEMORANDUM DECISION\nPursuant to Ind.

He asserts\n\n      that the order violated his due process rights and that the trial court erred by\n\n      executing the entirety of his suspended sentences with the Indiana Department\n\n      of Correction (DOC). Finding no due process violation and no error, we\n\n      affirm.\n\n\n                                                     Facts\n[2]   On September 4, 2012, the State charged Novak with Class A felony possession\n\n      of a narcotic drug. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, on January 10, 2013,\n\n      Novak pleaded guilty to Class B felony possession of a narcotic drug.\n\n      Following a February 21, 2013, sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced\n\n      him to six years, with three years executed in the DOC, one year in work\n\n      release, one year on electronic monitoring, and one year suspended to\n\n      probation.\n\n\n[3]   On November 2, 2012, in an unrelated cause, Novak was charged with Class A\n\n      and B felony dealing in a Schedule I controlled substance. On April 26, 2013,\n\n      pursuant to another written plea agreement, the State dismissed the Class A\n\n      felony charge and Novak pleaded guilty to Class B felony dealing in a Schedule\n\n      I controlled substance. On the same day, the trial court sentenced him to six\n\n      years, with two years suspended to probation and the executed portion to be\n\n      served consecutively to his first sentence. Under the terms of Novak\u2019s\n\n      probation for both causes, he was not permitted to travel outside Indiana\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 2 of 9\n\f      without an order from the trial court; he was not permitted to use, purchase, or\n\n      possess illegal drugs; and he was required to submit to alcohol and drug tests.\n\n\n[4]   On April 4, 2014, Novak filed a motion to modify his sentence under the\n\n      second cause and, on August 1, 2014, the trial court granted the motion and\n\n      modified the remainder of the executed portion of his sentence to work release,\n\n      beginning December 7, 2014. On April 13, 2015, LaPorte County Community\n\n      Corrections filed a petition to revoke Novak\u2019s placement, alleging that on three\n\n      occasions in March 2015, he failed to report to work or return to the work\n\n      release center. On July 14, 2015, after admitting to the violations at a hearing,\n\n      Novak was sentenced to six months in the LaPorte County Jail. After serving\n\n      that time, he returned to work release.\n\n\n[5]   On November 10, 2015, Novak was asked to submit to a drug test, and he\n\n      admitted that it would likely come back positive for heroin and prescription\n\n      drugs. Novak tested positive for heroin. On December 2 and 9, 2015, the\n\n      probation department filed petitions to revoke Novak\u2019s suspended sentences\n\n      under the second and first causes, respectively. On January 15, 2016, the trial\n\n      court held a hearing on both petitions and issued a bond order, releasing Novak\n\n      on his own recognizance and ordering him to report to probation and a\n\n      program aimed at helping those with substance abuse problems. On the same\n\n      day, Novak was referred to the Swanson Center and he completed his intake\n\n      there. His probation officer testified that, besides his intake, she had not\n\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 3 of 9\n\f      received any confirmation that he had attended classes or otherwise completed\n\n      the program.1 Tr. Vol. III p. 7, 11-13.\n\n\n[6]   On March 21, 2016, Novak submitted to another drug test, which was positive\n\n      for amphetamines; consequently, on April 5, 2016, the probation department\n\n      filed a second petition to revoke under the second cause and, on April 15, 2016,\n\n      the trial court issued a warrant for his arrest.\n\n\n[7]   After learning about the warrant and without contacting anyone, Novak\n\n      absconded to Texas. In April 2017, Novak was arrested in Texas and\n\n      extradited to Indiana. On May 26, 2017, the probation department filed a third\n\n      petition to revoke under both causes, alleging that Novak had left the state\n\n      without a trial court order.\n\n\n[8]   On June 8, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on the petitions. At the hearing,\n\n      Novak testified that he had a substance abuse problem and admitted that he had\n\n      used heroin and amphetamines and left the state without an order from the trial\n\n      court. Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 8. After hearing testimony from Novak and his\n\n      probation officer, the trial court found that he had violated the terms of his\n\n      probation for \u201cnot cooperating fully with Swanson Center, by missing\n\n      probation appointment meetings, by absconding to the State of Texas . . . , and\n\n      by testing positive for drugs while on probation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. Vol. II p.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       She also testified that Novak failed to attend two scheduled probation appointments on December 4 and 15,\n      2015. Tr. Vol. III p. 10.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018        Page 4 of 9\n\f       233. The trial court also noted that Novak failed to take advantage of his\n\n       sentence modification and that the court believed that a \u201cstructured\n\n       environment\u201d was the \u201cbest defense against further relapses.\u201d Tr. Vol. III p. 27.\n\n       Accordingly, the trial court revoked Novak\u2019s probation in both causes and\n\n       ordered him to serve the remainder of the suspended portions of his sentences\u2014\n\n       a total of three years\u2014with the DOC. Novak now appeals.\n\n\n                                    Discussion and Decision\n                                             I. Due Process\n[9]    First, Novak contends that the trial court violated his due process rights. It is\n\n       well established that \u201cprobationers are not entitled to the full array of\n\n       constitutional rights afforded defendants at trial.\u201d Lightcap v. State, 863 N.E.2d\n\n       907, 910 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007). However, among other things, a probationer is\n\n       entitled to written notice of the alleged violation. Wann v. State, 997 N.E.2d\n\n       1103, 1105 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013).\n\n\n[10]   Novak contends that two of the bases upon which the trial court relied\u2014the\n\n       failure to cooperate with Swanson Center and missing probation appointment\n\n       meetings\u2014were not listed in the petitions to revoke; he argues that,\n\n       consequently, he never received written notice of these violations and that it\n\n       was improper for the trial court to base its decision on them.\n\n\n[11]   A court may revoke a defendant\u2019s probation if \u201cthe person has violated a\n\n       condition of probation during the probationary period\u201d and the petition to\n\n       revoke was timely filed. Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-2-3(a). We have found the lack of\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 5 of 9\n\f       notice on one probation violation harmless when the probationer is found to\n\n       have violated another condition of probation where adequate notice was\n\n       provided. E.g., Bussberg v. State, 827 N.E.2d 37, 44 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005).\n\n\n[12]   In this case, it is undisputed that the terms of Novak\u2019s probation did not permit\n\n       him to use drugs or leave the state without an order from the trial court. It is\n\n       also undisputed that the petitions to revoke expressly identified these\n\n       conditions. Appellant\u2019s App. Vol. II p. 46, 187, 217. Further, Novak admitted\n\n       to taking heroin and amphetamines and leaving the state without an order from\n\n       the trial court. Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 8. Thus, even if Novak did not receive notice\n\n       of the other violations, because he admitted to violations for which he received\n\n       written notice, any error was harmless. See Bussberg, 827 N.E.2d at 44.\n\n\n[13]   Novak argues that the failure to provide written notice on these two grounds\n\n       was not harmless because the trial court was particularly \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the\n\n       allegations and, consequently, put undue emphasis on these violations.\n\n       Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 12. He notes that the two bases at issue were the first on the\n\n       order and that the trial court specifically questioned the probation officer about\n\n       these offenses. He speculates that the trial court may not have sentenced him to\n\n       the entirety of his suspended sentences had evidence of these violations not\n\n       been admitted. He also insists that the lack of notice compromised his ability to\n\n       put up a defense, because he was not prepared to prove exactly how many\n\n       classes he had attended at Swanson Center.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 6 of 9\n\f[14]   We find little merit in Novak\u2019s arguments. Novak cites to no portion of the\n\n       record nor do we find any that suggests that the trial court was particularly\n\n       fixated on Novak\u2019s alleged non-compliance with Swanson Center or missed\n\n       probation appointments. In any event, there is no prejudice to Novak with\n\n       respect to the Swanson Center because he admitted that he stopped attending\n\n       the classes altogether after he absconded to Texas.\n\n\n[15]   In sum, because Novak admitted to violations for which he received adequate\n\n       written notice, the trial court\u2019s order did not violate his due process rights.\n\n\n                                II. Placement with the DOC\n[16]   Next, Novak contends that the trial court erred by executing the balance of his\n\n       suspended sentences. Probation is a matter of grace left to the trial court\u2019s\n\n       discretion rather than a right to which a defendant is entitled, and we will not\n\n       reverse the trial court\u2019s decision unless the decision is clearly against the logic\n\n       and effect of the facts and circumstances. Prewitt v. State, 878 N.E.2d 184, 188\n\n       (Ind. 2007). A trial court may revoke a defendant\u2019s probation for violation of a\n\n       single condition of his probation, e.g., Pierce v. State, 44 N.E.3d 752, 755 (Ind.\n\n       Ct. App. 2015), and, once a violation is found, the trial court may execute all or\n\n       part of a suspended sentence, I.C. \u00a7 35-38-2-3(h)(3).\n\n\n[17]   Here, Novak admitted to violating his probation three times, but nonetheless\n\n       argues that the trial court erred and was excessively harsh when it executed the\n\n       suspended portions of his sentences. He emphasizes that this was the most\n\n       severe choice available, that it was the first time his probation had been\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 7 of 9\n\f       revoked, and that the trial court heavily relied on the bases for which he claims\n\n       he received deficient notice. He also claims that the decision is unduly severe\n\n       because his positive test for amphetamines was the result of a mistake and\n\n       because he went to Texas to see previously unmet family. We find his\n\n       arguments unpersuasive.\n\n\n[18]   Initially, we note that the trial court repeatedly provided Novak with leniency.\n\n       First, the trial court placed him on work release early by modifying his\n\n       sentence. Despite this opportunity, just months after this placement, he\n\n       violated its terms by failing to report to work or the work release center on three\n\n       occasions. Still, the trial court only sentenced Novak to six months in jail and\n\n       allowed him to return to work release afterwards. Novak squandered this\n\n       chance as well by testing positive for heroin; yet, in its bond order, the trial\n\n       court released Novak on his own recognizance and referred him to a program\n\n       aimed at helping those with substance abuse problems to get the help he\n\n       needed. However, Novak then fled to Texas after his positive test for\n\n       amphetamines.\n\n\n[19]   Further, Novak admitted that he was drug-free while in the DOC but that,\n\n       within two months of his placement with community corrections, he had tested\n\n       positive for heroin, supporting the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Novak\u2019s sobriety\n\n       will be best served in the DOC. And Novak admitted that he made a calculated\n\n       decision to abscond to Texas because he was scared and embarrassed of the\n\n       situation and he has offered no reason why his family reunion prevented him\n\n       from contacting probation or the court for the better part of a year.\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 8 of 9\n\f[20]   In sum, because Novak admitted to taking drugs and leaving the state while on\n\n       probation, the trial court did not err by revoking his probation. Furthermore,\n\n       considering the trial court\u2019s repeated attempts to provide leniency, Novak\u2019s\n\n       continued failure to take advantage of these opportunities, and his most recent\n\n       decision to abscond to Texas for the better part of a year, we cannot say that the\n\n       trial court\u2019s decision to execute the suspended portions of his sentences with the\n\n       DOC was clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances.\n\n\n[21]   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n       Riley, J., and Brown, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 46A05-1707-CR-1581 | January 24, 2018   Page 9 of 9\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "fd29fd51a14b5c8e1b073dd5da55ef42f6a0eea2", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Indiana Court of Appeals", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/852509/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2092079/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2094996/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2018-01-24T16:10:20.128701Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 9, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/4461583/mark-novak-v-state-of-indiana-mem-dec/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "4238836", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Mark Novak v.
