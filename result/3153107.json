Leona Mullins brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\naction on behalf of the estate of her sixteen-year-old son, Davon Mullins, after Oscar Cyranek\u2014\n\n\n\n\n                                               1\n\fNo. 14-3817                            Mullins v. Cyranek                          Page 2\n\na Cincinnati police officer\u2014fatally shot Mullins during a stop and frisk. Mullins\u2019s mother\nalleges Cyranek used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment by firing two shots\nat Mullins, despite Mullins having already released his weapon. She now appeals the district\ncourt\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Cyranek based on the court\u2019s determination that he was\nentitled to qualified immunity. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       On the afternoon of August 20, 2011, Cyranek, a police officer with the Cincinnati Police\nDepartment, was assigned to provide security outside the Black Family Reunion at Sawyer Point.\nDuring this time, Cyranek and the other officers on duty were informed that some young African\nAmerican males were throwing guns over the fence to individuals who were already inside the\nevent. After Cyranek and the other officers approached, the suspected individuals ran towards\ndowntown Cincinnati.\n\n       Cyranek and the other officers were then told to provide extra security at Government\nSquare and Fountain Square.       While at Government Square, Cyranek saw Davon Mullins\nwalking from Fountain Square. Although Cyranek did not recognize Mullins, he recognized the\ntwo other individuals with Mullins from Sawyer Point. Cyranek observed Mullins holding his\nright side, which led Cyranek to suspect that Mullins possessed a weapon. Cyranek continued to\nobserve Mullins and followed him back toward Fountain Square. According to Cyranek, each\ntime Mullins saw Cyranek he would position the right side of his body away from Cyranek. This\nmovement made Cyranek even more suspicious that Mullins had a weapon. Despite his concern,\nCyranek did not alert any other officers or radio in any reports of his concern.\n\n       Cyranek turned into the breezeway from Fountain Square as Mullins and his friend\nRecardo Sims entered the breezeway walking towards Fountain Square. Cyranek testified that\nhe was surprised to see Mullins because, in his experience, most people carrying illegal items\nflee when they see a police officer. Cyranek told Mullins to stop and Mullins complied.\nCyranek then approached Mullins and grabbed his wrists because he wanted to prevent Mullins\nfrom pulling out a gun, fighting him, or running away.\n\fNo. 14-3817                                 Mullins v. Cyranek                                Page 3\n\n        According to Cyranek, Mullins resisted when Cyranek grabbed his wrists. In response,\nCyranek pushed Mullins into an L-shaped corner of the breezeway to ensure the safety of the\npeople in Fountain Square. Recardo Sims, the only witness present, testified in his affidavit that\nit was Cyranek who started \u201ctussling\u201d with Mullins. Sims Aff. 1:7, ECF No. 34-2. As evidenced\nin the security footage, while still holding onto Mullins, Cyranek pushed Mullins to the ground\nand ended up behind Mullins\u2019s back. Cyranek testified that he was able to keep Mullins down\non the ground because he was bigger than Mullins. And according to Sims, Mullins was\nstruggling to protect himself as he was much smaller than Cyranek. During this time, Cyranek\nchecked one side of Mullins\u2019s cargo pants as Mullins said something along the lines of \u201cI didn\u2019t\ndo anything.\u201d Cyranek Dep. 161\u201362, ECF No. 27. The entire confrontation lasted nearly two\nminutes.\n\n        While Cyranek held Mullins to the ground, Mullins yelled something to Sims and Sims\napproached. According to Sims, he asked Cyranek what was going on and what Mullins did\nwrong, but Cyranek did not recall Sims saying anything to him. Cyranek claims that when he\ntold Sims to step away, he saw that Mullins had a weapon in his right hand with the finger on the\ntrigger. According to Sims, Cyranek told Mullins to drop the gun and, in response, Mullins\nthrew it over Cyranek\u2019s left shoulder.1\n\n        Cyranek testified that for nearly the entire encounter with Mullins he had his right hand\non Mullins\u2019s right bicep and was able to control his arms. Sims also testified that Cyranek \u201cwas\nalways in control of Davon.\u201d Sims Aff. 2:11, ECF No. 34-2. But at some point after Mullins\nbrandished the gun, he gained enough freedom from Cyranek\u2019s grip to throw his weapon ten to\nfifteen feet behind Cyranek. At the same time Mullins threw his gun, Sims turned and sprinted\naway from where Cyranek and Mullins were engaged. Likewise, other surveillance footage\nshows patrons at a crowded patio bar nearby visibly reacting to the events at this time.\n\n        As Mullins threw his gun, Cyranek quickly rose from his crouched position and fired\ntwice. The footage shows that, at most, five seconds elapsed between when Mullins threw his\nfirearm and when Cyranek fired his final shot. J. Scott Spicer, an Ohio police officer trained in\n\n        1\n           Although Cyranek stated in both his deposition and in the investigation interview that Mullins threw the\ngun after Cyranek fired two shots, the video footage of the incident indicates otherwise. On appeal, Cyranek accepts\nMullins\u2019s version of the facts.\n\fNo. 14-3817                                 Mullins v. Cyranek                              Page 4\n\nthe same procedures as Cyranek, testified that an officer is trained to fire twice only in a \u201c\u2018body\narmor take-down\u2019 situation,\u201d otherwise an officer may fire to stop the aggressive action but then\nmust reassess the threat, re-evaluate, and fire again if necessary. Spicer Aff. 6:39, ECF No. 34-1.\n\n        Surveillance video of the incident does not show precisely when, within the five second\nwindow, Cyranek fired his two shots. The only evidence of the timing of the shots are the bullet\ncasings, which can be seen flying across the screen in one of the surveillance videos. The first\ncasing appears approximately three seconds after Mullins threw his gun. The second casing\nappears approximately two seconds after the first. However, it bears noting that the bullet\ncasings are not conclusive evidence of the precise timing of Cyranek\u2019s shots. The footage shows\nCyranek first turn away from Mullins in the direction of where Mullins\u2019s gun landed while the\nsecond bullet casing flies into view. If we were to assume that the bullet casings appear\ninstantaneously with the actual shots, then we would also have to assume that Cyranek fired his\nsecond shot while he was turned away from Mullins, but there is nothing in the record to support\nsuch an assumption.\n\n        After firing the two shots, Cyranek retrieved the gun that Mullins had thrown and placed\nit near Mullins\u2019s feet. Cyranek claims to have done so to secure the weapon so that no one else\ncould pick it up. He acknowledged that in doing so he changed the scene of the shooting. As\nother officers arrived on the scene, Cyranek handcuffed Mullins.\n\n        Medics transported Mullins to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy\nfound the cause of death to be a gunshot wound to the torso. The post-mortem examination\nrevealed that Mullins was shot in the back of his left shoulder and that the bullet traveled a\ndownward path from left to right.\n\n        On May 16, 2012, alleging violations of rights guaranteed under the United States\nConstitution, Leona Mullins filed suit on behalf of her son\u2019s estate under \u00a7 1983.2 She also\nasserted four state causes of action: wrongful death, negligence, assault, and battery. Cyranek\nmoved for summary judgment, asserting qualified immunity. The district court determined that\n\n        2\n           Leona Mullins\u2019s complaint additionally asserted a denial of Davon Mullins\u2019s constitutional rights under\nthe Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and the Ohio Constitution, as well as a denial of due process in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Ohio Constitution. These claims were dismissed unopposed.\n\fNo. 14-3817                           Mullins v. Cyranek                         Page 5\n\nCyranek was entitled to qualified immunity because he acted reasonably under the\ncircumstances. Mullins v.

Summary judgment is appropriate where the\nevidence in the record, viewed in its entirety, shows that there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(a). The court must assume the truth of the non-moving party\u2019s evidence, drawing all\ninferences in a light most favorable to that party. Ciminillo, 434 F.3d at 464. If, in doing so,\nthere is sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, a genuine dispute\nof material fact exists.

We must judge the reasonableness of the use of force from the perspective of a\nreasonable officer on the scene and not through the lens of 20/20 hindsight, allowing for the fact\n\u201cthat police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances that are\ntense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u2014about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular\nsituation.\u201d Graham v.

Although Cyranek admits that, at the outset, he had probable\ncause to believe only that Mullins had a weapon\u2014a first degree misdemeanor if possessed\nwithout a permit, see Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2923.12\u2014Mullins removal of a handgun in Cyranek\u2019s\npresence without Cyranek\u2019s permission constituted a much more serious offense. See, e.g., Ohio\nRev. Code \u00a7 2923.12(B)(3), (F)(5) (making it a fifth degree felony for someone with a concealed\nhandgun license to remove their firearm without permission during a law enforcement stop).\nThe district court noted that Mullins\u2019 actions may also fall within Ohio\u2019s felonious assault\nstatute.

Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.11). The\nresistance factor also weighs in favor of Cyranek. Prior to the fatal shooting, Mullins physically\nstruggled with Cyranek for well over a minute, and Mullins decision to produce his firearm\nwithout permission also weighs against him.\n\n       The question of whether it was reasonable for Cyranek to believe that Mullins posed a\nsignificant threat at the time Mullins was shot is the crux of this appeal. In excessive force cases,\nthe threat factor is \u201ca minimum requirement for the use of deadly force,\u201d meaning deadly force\n\u201cmay be used only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of\nsevere physical harm.\u201d Untalan v.

See Untalan 430 F.3d at 315.\nWhile hindsight reveals that Mullins was no longer a threat when he was shot, we do not think it\nis prudent to deny police officers qualified immunity in situations where they are faced with a\nthreat of severe physical injury or death and must make split-second decisions, albeit ultimately\nmistaken decisions, about the amount of force necessary to subdue such a threat. See, e.g.,\nSigman v.

Here, however, Cyranek\u2019s second\nshot did not come at a time after which a reasonable officer would think the threat had passed.\nRather, Cyranek\u2019s second shot came within the time frame in which a reasonable officer could\nhave acted under the perception that Mullins was still armed.

We noted that the question of reasonableness was clear because the officer was acting\nin self-defense against a felon \u201creasonably thought to be armed and dangerous.\u201d Boyd, 215 F.3d\nat 602\u201303. Boyd and Untalan thus combine to answer any question about the reasonableness of\nCyranek\u2019s second shot. Because we find that a reasonable officer could have believed that\nMullins was armed for the \u201cfew seconds\u201d after Cyranek saw the gun in Mullins hand, it was\nreasonable for Cyranek to fire a second time within that time frame. Cyranek\u2019s second shot was\nnot unnecessary, gratuitous, or otherwise excessive, particularly in light of the fact that the\nautopsy report showed Mullins only suffered one gunshot wound.\n\n       J. Scott Spicer, a former Ohio police officer, testified that Cincinnati police officers are\ntrained to fire two shots only in a \u201c\u2018body armor take-down situation,\u201d but that, otherwise, officers\nshould fire a second shot only if they deem it necessary after reassessing and re-evaluating the\nthreat. Spicer Aff. 6:39, ECF no. 34-1. Whether or not an officer is following police procedures\nis certainly relevant to the question of reasonableness in excessive force cases, but it is not\nnecessarily conclusive proof that the Constitution has been violated. Rather, the key inquiry is\nwhether a reasonable officer in the same circumstances would have used the same amount of\nforce. Here, we find that at the time he fired both shots, it was reasonable for Cyranek to\nperceive Mullins as a serious threat to himself and others. That conclusion, coupled with the\nother reasonableness factors compels us to conclude that Cyranek\u2019s use of deadly force was\nreasonable under the circumstances.\n\fNo. 14-3817                           Mullins v. Cyranek                      Page 11\n\n       Our opinion should not be taken to condone the whole of Cyranek\u2019s behavior. Indeed,\nwe find some of Cyranek\u2019s conduct problematic, particularly his failure to alert any other\nofficers before physically confronting Mullins, and his decision, following the shooting, to alter\nthe scene by moving Mullins\u2019s gun closer to his body. However, these misjudgments are not\nrelevant to his qualified immunity defense. As noted above, we must analyze the reasonableness\nof an officer\u2019s use of deadly force based on an \u201cobjective assessment of the danger a suspect\nposes at that moment.\u201d Bouggess, 482 F.3d at 889 (emphasis added). We cannot say that during\nthe critical moments just after Mullins drew his gun Cyranek\u2019s actions were unreasonable. At a\nminimum, we believe that reasonable officers could disagree about what force was necessary in\nthis situation. And, thus, we find that no constitutional violation occurred and that Cyranek is\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                               IV.\n\n       Leona Mullins also alleges state law claims of wrongful death, negligence, assault, and\nbattery. Relying on its finding that Cyranek\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable in the context\nof Mullins\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, the district court dismissed Leona Mullins\u2019s state-law claims. We\nagree with the district court and conclude that Cyranek is entitled to immunity on Leona\nMullins\u2019s state-law claims as well. Because we find that Cyranek\u2019s use of deadly force was not\nobjectively unreasonable under the circumstances, it follows that he did not act with \u201cmalicious\npurpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner,\u201d as required to avoid statutory\nimmunity under Ohio law. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2744.03 (A)(6)(b); see Chappell, 585 F.3d at 916\nn.3 (finding that where officer who acted reasonably was entitled to qualified immunity on both\nfederal and Ohio state-law claims).\n\n                                               V.\n\n       The shooting of Davon Mullins was an unfortunate tragedy.           Yet, as we view the\nundisputed facts of this case in light of binding precedent, we are compelled to conclude that\nCyranek\u2019s split-second decision to use deadly force was not objectively unreasonable. Although\nCyranek was ultimately mistaken about the continuing nature of the risk involved, his mistake\nwas a reasonable one under the circumstances, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not purport to redress\n\fNo. 14-3817                         Mullins v.

Leona Mullins brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\naction on behalf of the estate of her sixteen-year-old son, Davon Mullins, after Oscar Cyranek\u2014\n\n\n\n\n                                               1\n\fNo. 14-3817                            Mullins v. Cyranek                          Page 2\n\na Cincinnati police officer\u2014fatally shot Mullins during a stop and frisk. Mullins\u2019s mother\nalleges Cyranek used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment by firing two shots\nat Mullins, despite Mullins having already released his weapon. She now appeals the district\ncourt\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Cyranek based on the court\u2019s determination that he was\nentitled to qualified immunity. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court.\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       On the afternoon of August 20, 2011, Cyranek, a police officer with the Cincinnati Police\nDepartment, was assigned to provide security outside the Black Family Reunion at Sawyer Point.\nDuring this time, Cyranek and the other officers on duty were informed that some young African\nAmerican males were throwing guns over the fence to individuals who were already inside the\nevent. After Cyranek and the other officers approached, the suspected individuals ran towards\ndowntown Cincinnati.\n\n       Cyranek and the other officers were then told to provide extra security at Government\nSquare and Fountain Square.       While at Government Square, Cyranek saw Davon Mullins\nwalking from Fountain Square. Although Cyranek did not recognize Mullins, he recognized the\ntwo other individuals with Mullins from Sawyer Point. Cyranek observed Mullins holding his\nright side, which led Cyranek to suspect that Mullins possessed a weapon. Cyranek continued to\nobserve Mullins and followed him back toward Fountain Square. According to Cyranek, each\ntime Mullins saw Cyranek he would position the right side of his body away from Cyranek. This\nmovement made Cyranek even more suspicious that Mullins had a weapon. Despite his concern,\nCyranek did not alert any other officers or radio in any reports of his concern.\n\n       Cyranek turned into the breezeway from Fountain Square as Mullins and his friend\nRecardo Sims entered the breezeway walking towards Fountain Square. Cyranek testified that\nhe was surprised to see Mullins because, in his experience, most people carrying illegal items\nflee when they see a police officer. Cyranek told Mullins to stop and Mullins complied.\nCyranek then approached Mullins and grabbed his wrists because he wanted to prevent Mullins\nfrom pulling out a gun, fighting him, or running away.\n\fNo. 14-3817                                 Mullins v. Cyranek                                Page 3\n\n        According to Cyranek, Mullins resisted when Cyranek grabbed his wrists. In response,\nCyranek pushed Mullins into an L-shaped corner of the breezeway to ensure the safety of the\npeople in Fountain Square. Recardo Sims, the only witness present, testified in his affidavit that\nit was Cyranek who started \u201ctussling\u201d with Mullins. Sims Aff. 1:7, ECF No. 34-2. As evidenced\nin the security footage, while still holding onto Mullins, Cyranek pushed Mullins to the ground\nand ended up behind Mullins\u2019s back. Cyranek testified that he was able to keep Mullins down\non the ground because he was bigger than Mullins. And according to Sims, Mullins was\nstruggling to protect himself as he was much smaller than Cyranek. During this time, Cyranek\nchecked one side of Mullins\u2019s cargo pants as Mullins said something along the lines of \u201cI didn\u2019t\ndo anything.\u201d Cyranek Dep. 161\u201362, ECF No. 27. The entire confrontation lasted nearly two\nminutes.\n\n        While Cyranek held Mullins to the ground, Mullins yelled something to Sims and Sims\napproached. According to Sims, he asked Cyranek what was going on and what Mullins did\nwrong, but Cyranek did not recall Sims saying anything to him. Cyranek claims that when he\ntold Sims to step away, he saw that Mullins had a weapon in his right hand with the finger on the\ntrigger. According to Sims, Cyranek told Mullins to drop the gun and, in response, Mullins\nthrew it over Cyranek\u2019s left shoulder.1\n\n        Cyranek testified that for nearly the entire encounter with Mullins he had his right hand\non Mullins\u2019s right bicep and was able to control his arms. Sims also testified that Cyranek \u201cwas\nalways in control of Davon.\u201d Sims Aff. 2:11, ECF No. 34-2. But at some point after Mullins\nbrandished the gun, he gained enough freedom from Cyranek\u2019s grip to throw his weapon ten to\nfifteen feet behind Cyranek. At the same time Mullins threw his gun, Sims turned and sprinted\naway from where Cyranek and Mullins were engaged. Likewise, other surveillance footage\nshows patrons at a crowded patio bar nearby visibly reacting to the events at this time.\n\n        As Mullins threw his gun, Cyranek quickly rose from his crouched position and fired\ntwice. The footage shows that, at most, five seconds elapsed between when Mullins threw his\nfirearm and when Cyranek fired his final shot. J. Scott Spicer, an Ohio police officer trained in\n\n        1\n           Although Cyranek stated in both his deposition and in the investigation interview that Mullins threw the\ngun after Cyranek fired two shots, the video footage of the incident indicates otherwise. On appeal, Cyranek accepts\nMullins\u2019s version of the facts.\n\fNo. 14-3817                                 Mullins v. Cyranek                              Page 4\n\nthe same procedures as Cyranek, testified that an officer is trained to fire twice only in a \u201c\u2018body\narmor take-down\u2019 situation,\u201d otherwise an officer may fire to stop the aggressive action but then\nmust reassess the threat, re-evaluate, and fire again if necessary. Spicer Aff. 6:39, ECF No. 34-1.\n\n        Surveillance video of the incident does not show precisely when, within the five second\nwindow, Cyranek fired his two shots. The only evidence of the timing of the shots are the bullet\ncasings, which can be seen flying across the screen in one of the surveillance videos. The first\ncasing appears approximately three seconds after Mullins threw his gun. The second casing\nappears approximately two seconds after the first. However, it bears noting that the bullet\ncasings are not conclusive evidence of the precise timing of Cyranek\u2019s shots. The footage shows\nCyranek first turn away from Mullins in the direction of where Mullins\u2019s gun landed while the\nsecond bullet casing flies into view. If we were to assume that the bullet casings appear\ninstantaneously with the actual shots, then we would also have to assume that Cyranek fired his\nsecond shot while he was turned away from Mullins, but there is nothing in the record to support\nsuch an assumption.\n\n        After firing the two shots, Cyranek retrieved the gun that Mullins had thrown and placed\nit near Mullins\u2019s feet. Cyranek claims to have done so to secure the weapon so that no one else\ncould pick it up. He acknowledged that in doing so he changed the scene of the shooting. As\nother officers arrived on the scene, Cyranek handcuffed Mullins.\n\n        Medics transported Mullins to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy\nfound the cause of death to be a gunshot wound to the torso. The post-mortem examination\nrevealed that Mullins was shot in the back of his left shoulder and that the bullet traveled a\ndownward path from left to right.\n\n        On May 16, 2012, alleging violations of rights guaranteed under the United States\nConstitution, Leona Mullins filed suit on behalf of her son\u2019s estate under \u00a7 1983.2 She also\nasserted four state causes of action: wrongful death, negligence, assault, and battery. Cyranek\nmoved for summary judgment, asserting qualified immunity. The district court determined that\n\n        2\n           Leona Mullins\u2019s complaint additionally asserted a denial of Davon Mullins\u2019s constitutional rights under\nthe Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments and the Ohio Constitution, as well as a denial of due process in\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Ohio Constitution. These claims were dismissed unopposed.\n\fNo. 14-3817                           Mullins v.

Summary judgment is appropriate where the\nevidence in the record, viewed in its entirety, shows that there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 56(a). The court must assume the truth of the non-moving party\u2019s evidence, drawing all\ninferences in a light most favorable to that party. Ciminillo, 434 F.3d at 464. If, in doing so,\nthere is sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, a genuine dispute\nof material fact exists.

Millender, 132 S. Ct. 1235, 1244 (2012). Qualified immunity provides police\nofficers \u201cbreathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments and protects all but the\nplainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d Stanton v. Sims, 134 S. Ct. 3, 5\n(2013) (per curiam) (citations and quotation marks omitted). In a civil suit arising from the use\nof deadly force, immunity should be recognized \u201cif officers of reasonable competence could\ndisagree on the issue.\u201d Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).\n\n        To determine whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity, we apply a well-\nestablished two-prong test: (1) whether the facts, when taken in the light most favorable to the\nparty asserting the injury, show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right; and\n(2) whether the right violated was clearly established such \u201cthat a reasonable official would\nunderstand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201\u2013\n02 (2001) (citation omitted). The order in which we analyze these two prongs is left to our\n\u201csound discretion.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009). Because it is axiomatic that\n\fNo. 14-3817                           Mullins v.

Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 11 (1985)),\nwe must determine whether, in light of the facts and circumstances of this case, Cyranek\u2019s use of\ndeadly force violated Mullins\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force.\n\n         In answering whether Cyranek violated Mullins\u2019s constitutional rights, we must\ndetermine whether his use of deadly force was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. See\nPlumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 2020 (2014). In prior cases we have employed a non-\nexhaustive list of three factors to evaluate whether an officer\u2019s actions are reasonable: \u201c(1) the\nseverity of the crime at issue; (2) whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of\nthe officers or others; and (3) whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to\nevade arrest by flight.\u201d Sigley v. City of Parma Heights, 437 F.3d 527, 534 (6th Cir. 2006).\nThese factors help inform our ultimate inquiry, which must always be \u201cwhether the totality of the\ncircumstances\u201d justified the use of force. Livermore v. Lubelan, 476 F.3d 397, 404 (6th Cir.\n2007).    We must judge the reasonableness of the use of force from the perspective of a\nreasonable officer on the scene and not through the lens of 20/20 hindsight, allowing for the fact\n\u201cthat police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances that are\ntense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving\u2014about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular\nsituation.\u201d Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396\u201397 (1989); see also Saucier, 533 U.S. at 206\n(noting that qualified immunity serves to \u201cprotect officers from the sometimes hazy border\nbetween excessive and acceptable force\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted). In making this\njudgment, we must be careful not to substitute \u201cour personal notions of proper police procedure\nfor the instantaneous decision of the officer at the scene.\u201d Smith v. Freland, 954 F.2d 343, 347\n(6th Cir. 1992). Rather, we must adopt a \u201cbuilt-in measure of deference to the officer\u2019s on-the-\nspot judgment about the level of force necessary in light of the circumstances of the particular\ncase.\u201d Burchett v. Kiefer, 310 F.3d 937, 944 (6th Cir. 2002). After all, \u201c[w]hat constitutes\n\u2018reasonable\u2019 action may seem quite different to someone facing a possible assailant than to\nsomeone analyzing the question at leisure.\u201d Dickerson v. McClellan, 101 F.3d 1151, 1163\n(6th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted).\n\fNo. 14-3817                            Mullins v. Cyranek                         Page 7\n\n       Turning to the reasonableness factors, we find that the severity-of-the-crime inquiry\nweighs in favor of Cyranek. We measure the reasonableness of the use of deadly force at a\nparticular time based on an \u201cobjective assessment of the danger a suspect poses at that moment.\u201d\nBouggess v. Mattingly, 482 F.3d 886, 889 (6th Cir. 2007) (emphasis added). Thus, in analyzing\nthe reasonableness of Cyranek\u2019s use of force, we must look at Mullins\u2019s behavior immediately\nprior to the moment he was shot. Although Cyranek admits that, at the outset, he had probable\ncause to believe only that Mullins had a weapon\u2014a first degree misdemeanor if possessed\nwithout a permit, see Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2923.12\u2014Mullins removal of a handgun in Cyranek\u2019s\npresence without Cyranek\u2019s permission constituted a much more serious offense. See, e.g., Ohio\nRev. Code \u00a7 2923.12(B)(3), (F)(5) (making it a fifth degree felony for someone with a concealed\nhandgun license to remove their firearm without permission during a law enforcement stop).\nThe district court noted that Mullins\u2019 actions may also fall within Ohio\u2019s felonious assault\nstatute. Mullins, 2014 WL 3573565, at *11 n. 17 (citing Ohio. Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.11). The\nresistance factor also weighs in favor of Cyranek. Prior to the fatal shooting, Mullins physically\nstruggled with Cyranek for well over a minute, and Mullins decision to produce his firearm\nwithout permission also weighs against him.\n\n       The question of whether it was reasonable for Cyranek to believe that Mullins posed a\nsignificant threat at the time Mullins was shot is the crux of this appeal. In excessive force cases,\nthe threat factor is \u201ca minimum requirement for the use of deadly force,\u201d meaning deadly force\n\u201cmay be used only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of\nsevere physical harm.\u201d Untalan v. City of Lorain, 430 F.3d 312, 314 (6th Cir. 2005) (emphasis\nadded); see also Ciminillo, 434 F.3d at 468 (stating that a person has a \u201cright not to be shot\nunless they are perceived as posing a threat to officers or others\u201d) On appeal, Cyranek concedes\nthat he shot Mullins only after Mullins threw his gun, but he maintains that the confrontation\nunfolded in such rapid succession that he did not have a chance to realize that a potentially\ndangerous situation had evolved into a safe one. See Smith v. Cupp, 430 F.3d 766, 774\u201375 (6th\nCir. 2005).\n\n       The fact that a situation unfolds quickly \u201cdoes not, by itself, permit [officers] to use\ndeadly force.\u201d Id. at 775. Rather, qualified immunity is available only where officers make\n\fNo. 14-3817                           Mullins v. Cyranek                      Page 8\n\nsplit-second decisions in the face of serious physical threats to themselves and others. See\nGodawa v. Byrd, 798 F.3d 457, 465 (6th Cir. 2015); Smith, 430 F.3d 775; Sample, 409 F.3d at\n696\u201397. We have previously held that \u201c[w]ithin a few seconds of reasonably perceiving a\nsufficient danger, officers may use deadly force even if in hindsight the facts show that the\npersons threatened could have escaped unharmed.\u201d Untalan v. City of Lorain, 430 F.3d 312,\n315\u201316 (6th Cir. 2005). Here, it is undisputed that within a five-second span, Mullins removed a\npreviously concealed firearm without any direction from Cyranek to do so, threw the weapon\nover Cyranek\u2019s shoulder after being commanded to drop it, and was then shot at twice and struck\nonce by Cyranek. Importantly, all of these events transpired in the early evening hours in a\nbreezeway leading onto Fountain Square, a populated city square with shops, restaurants, hotels,\nand offices in downtown Cincinnati.\n\n       This is not a case where \u201ca jury could conclude that [Cyranek] was not in any danger in\nthe first place.\u201d Smith, 430 F.3d at 775; see also Kirby v. Duva, 530 F.3d 475, 481\u201382 (6th Cir.\n2008) (denying qualified immunity to officer where, under plaintiffs facts, \u201cno one was ever in\ndanger\u201d). Mullins had his finger on the trigger of a gun, and at that time, he posed a serious\nthreat to Cyranek and the general public at Fountain Square, including Sims, Mullins\u2019s friend,\nwho can be seen in video footage sprinting away from Cyranek and Mullins at the same time\nMullins pulls out and throws his gun. While Cyranek\u2019s decision to shoot Mullins after he threw\nhis weapon may appear unreasonable in the \u201csanitized world of our imagination,\u201d Dickerson,\n101 F.3d at 1163 (citation omitted), Cyranek was faced with a rapidly escalating situation, and\nhis decision to use deadly force in the face of a severe threat to himself and the public was\nreasonable. See Untalan 430 F.3d at 315\u201316 (finding police officer\u2019s use of deadly force\nreasonable where only a \u201cfew seconds\u201d passed between when assailant lost control of knife and\nwhen officer shot assailant); see also Troupe v. Sarasota County, 419 F.3d 1160, 1168 (11th Cir.\n2005) (finding that 3\u20135 seconds was a short enough time for the use of deadly force to stop\nsomeone who previously endangered police and bystanders even if, in hindsight, the facts show\nthat members of the S.W.A.T. Team could have escaped unharmed); Robinson v. Arrugueta,\n415 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir. 2005) (holding that an Officer\u2019s decision to shoot within a\nreaction time of 2.72 seconds was reasonable, even if hindsight showed that the officer could\nhave escaped unharmed); Pace v. Capobianco, 283 F.3d 1275, 1282 (11th Cir. 2002) (justifying\n\fNo. 14-3817                            Mullins v.

See Pollard v. City of Columbus, Ohio, 780 F.3d 395, 403\u2013\n04 (6th Cir. 2015), cert. denied (2015 WL 4467981) (\u201cThat [decedent] was actually unarmed and\ndid not have a permit is beside the point\u201d). Rather, \u201cwhat matters is the reasonableness of the\nofficers\u2019 belief . . . .\u201d Id. Because only a few seconds passed between when Mullins brandished\nhis firearm and when Cyranek shot Mullins, a reasonable officer in the same situation could have\nfired with the belief that Mullins still had the gun in his hand. See Untalan 430 F.3d at 315.\nWhile hindsight reveals that Mullins was no longer a threat when he was shot, we do not think it\nis prudent to deny police officers qualified immunity in situations where they are faced with a\nthreat of severe physical injury or death and must make split-second decisions, albeit ultimately\nmistaken decisions, about the amount of force necessary to subdue such a threat. See, e.g.,\nSigman v. Town of Chapel Hill, 161 F.3d 782, 792 (4th Cir. 1998) (\u201c[W]e do not think it wise to\nrequire a police officer, in all instances, to actually detect the presence of an object in a suspect\u2019s\nhands before firing on him.\u201d); Reese v. Anderson, 926 F.2d 494, 501 (5th Cir. 1991) (\u201cAlso\nirrelevant is the fact that [the decedent] was actually unarmed . . . The sad truth is that [the\ndecedent\u2019s] actions alone could cause a reasonable officer to fear imminent and serious physical\nharm.\u201d)\n\n        Our reasoning applies equally to both of the shots fired by Cyranek. We have previously\nheld that \u201c[w]hen an officer faces a situation in which he could justifiably shoot, he does not\nretain the right to shoot at any time thereafter with impunity.\u201d Dickerson, 101 F.3d at 1162 n.9\n(quoting Ellis v. Wynalda, 999 F.2d 243, 247 (7th Cir. 1993)). Here, however, Cyranek\u2019s second\nshot did not come at a time after which a reasonable officer would think the threat had passed.\nRather, Cyranek\u2019s second shot came within the time frame in which a reasonable officer could\nhave acted under the perception that Mullins was still armed. See Untalan, 430 F.3d at 315.\n\fNo. 14-3817                           Mullins v. Cyranek                        Page 10\n\nIndeed, the video footage shows that Mullins\u2019s gun landed some ten to fifteen feet behind\nCyranek out of his line of sight and that Cyranek did not turn towards where it landed until after\nhe fired his second shot.\n\n       In Boyd v. Baeppler, we found that an officer was entitled to qualified immunity where\nhe shot the decedent seven times even after the decedent had been brought down by another\nofficer\u2019s shot. 215 F.3d 594, 602\u201304 (6th Cir. 2000); see also Chappell v. City of Cleveland,\n585 F.3d 901, 910\u201316 (6th Cir. 2009) (finding officers were entitled to qualified immunity where\nthey shot a knife-wielding suspect ten times); Livermore, 476 F.3d at 401\u201305 (finding it\nobjectively reasonable for officer to fire two shots at suspect who posed a serious threat to other\nofficers). We noted that the question of reasonableness was clear because the officer was acting\nin self-defense against a felon \u201creasonably thought to be armed and dangerous.\u201d Boyd, 215 F.3d\nat 602\u201303. Boyd and Untalan thus combine to answer any question about the reasonableness of\nCyranek\u2019s second shot. Because we find that a reasonable officer could have believed that\nMullins was armed for the \u201cfew seconds\u201d after Cyranek saw the gun in Mullins hand, it was\nreasonable for Cyranek to fire a second time within that time frame. Cyranek\u2019s second shot was\nnot unnecessary, gratuitous, or otherwise excessive, particularly in light of the fact that the\nautopsy report showed Mullins only suffered one gunshot wound.\n\n       J. Scott Spicer, a former Ohio police officer, testified that Cincinnati police officers are\ntrained to fire two shots only in a \u201c\u2018body armor take-down situation,\u201d but that, otherwise, officers\nshould fire a second shot only if they deem it necessary after reassessing and re-evaluating the\nthreat. Spicer Aff. 6:39, ECF no. 34-1. Whether or not an officer is following police procedures\nis certainly relevant to the question of reasonableness in excessive force cases, but it is not\nnecessarily conclusive proof that the Constitution has been violated. Rather, the key inquiry is\nwhether a reasonable officer in the same circumstances would have used the same amount of\nforce. Here, we find that at the time he fired both shots, it was reasonable for Cyranek to\nperceive Mullins as a serious threat to himself and others. That conclusion, coupled with the\nother reasonableness factors compels us to conclude that Cyranek\u2019s use of deadly force was\nreasonable under the circumstances.\n\fNo. 14-3817                           Mullins v. Cyranek                      Page 11\n\n       Our opinion should not be taken to condone the whole of Cyranek\u2019s behavior. Indeed,\nwe find some of Cyranek\u2019s conduct problematic, particularly his failure to alert any other\nofficers before physically confronting Mullins, and his decision, following the shooting, to alter\nthe scene by moving Mullins\u2019s gun closer to his body. However, these misjudgments are not\nrelevant to his qualified immunity defense. As noted above, we must analyze the reasonableness\nof an officer\u2019s use of deadly force based on an \u201cobjective assessment of the danger a suspect\nposes at that moment.\u201d Bouggess, 482 F.3d at 889 (emphasis added). We cannot say that during\nthe critical moments just after Mullins drew his gun Cyranek\u2019s actions were unreasonable. At a\nminimum, we believe that reasonable officers could disagree about what force was necessary in\nthis situation. And, thus, we find that no constitutional violation occurred and that Cyranek is\nentitled to qualified immunity.\n\n                                               IV.\n\n       Leona Mullins also alleges state law claims of wrongful death, negligence, assault, and\nbattery. Relying on its finding that Cyranek\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable in the context\nof Mullins\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, the district court dismissed Leona Mullins\u2019s state-law claims. We\nagree with the district court and conclude that Cyranek is entitled to immunity on Leona\nMullins\u2019s state-law claims as well. Because we find that Cyranek\u2019s use of deadly force was not\nobjectively unreasonable under the circumstances, it follows that he did not act with \u201cmalicious\npurpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner,\u201d as required to avoid statutory\nimmunity under Ohio law. Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2744.03 (A)(6)(b); see Chappell, 585 F.3d at 916\nn.3 (finding that where officer who acted reasonably was entitled to qualified immunity on both\nfederal and Ohio state-law claims).\n\n                                               V.\n\n       The shooting of Davon Mullins was an unfortunate tragedy.           Yet, as we view the\nundisputed facts of this case in light of binding precedent, we are compelled to conclude that\nCyranek\u2019s split-second decision to use deadly force was not objectively unreasonable. Although\nCyranek was ultimately mistaken about the continuing nature of the risk involved, his mistake\nwas a reasonable one under the circumstances, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 does not purport to redress\n\fNo. 14-3817                         Mullins v. Cyranek                     Page 12\n\ninjuries resulting from reasonable mistakes. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district\ncourt\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Cyranek.\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "3d63a2e359c3f8528fedaa635dd3a173007f949a", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/77035/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/77082/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111397/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111611/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112257/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145918/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/556461/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/576267/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/611654/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/623242/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/672879/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/730865/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/759531/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/776968/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/779861/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/790419/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/792554/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/792586/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/792929/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/793275/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/796758/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/797394/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1189741/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1192312/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2641101/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2675750/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2015-11-09T16:00:50.850722Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 12, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/3153107/leona-mullins-v-oscar-cyranek/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "3153107", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Leona Mullins v.
