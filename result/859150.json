The district court1\nsentenced Nicklas to forty-five months of imprisonment. Nicklas appeals his\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Jimm Larry Hendren, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Arkansas.\n\fconviction raising three issues: (1) the district court erred when it allowed the\ngovernment to redact the word \"willfully\" from the indictment in reference to\nNicklas's state of mind when committing the crime; (2) the evidence was insufficient\nto support the verdict; and (3) the district court committed instructional error when it\nrejected Nicklas's proffered jury instruction on reasonable doubt. We affirm.\n\n                                           I\n\n       Sometime in 2008, Nicklas claims he received a vision that the mob purchased\na property on his behalf in Rogers, Arkansas (the Rogers property). Following his\nvision, Nicklas wrote a series of letters to several people demanding they give him the\ndeed to the Rogers property. The people Nicklas contacted included the developer of\nthe Rogers property; the prosecutor for Benton County, Arkansas; the agent in charge\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) office in Little Rock, Arkansas; and the\nInspector General of the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. In these letters,\nNicklas claimed he was personally responsible for costing organized crime over $1\nbillion, took credit for all the terrorists housed in Guantanamo Bay, and said he saved\nover 7,000 teenage girls who were kidnaped by the mob for prostitution and\npornography. Nicklas claimed the mob placed the Rogers property in his name to\nimplicate him in the mob's illegal activities, while at the same time claiming the mob\nintended to use the property as a drug and prostitution house.\n\n       Nicklas sent a total of four letters to the Inspector General. The third letter,\nwhich Nicklas faxed to the Inspector General on September 28, 2008, contained a\nthreat to kill FBI agents. Specifically, the letter stated the following:\n\n      Dear sir. I understand the FBI is under attack nationwide. Agents are\n      being killed in a number of cities and a major task force is trying to\n      figure out why. Remember what I told you last week. Tom Duvall,\n      Gambino crime boss, gave you a message. For each day I do not receive\n      the deed to my property which you are illegally holding, an FBI agent\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      will die. The deadline is noon of each day. The FBI satellite office in\n      Fayetteville, Arkansas has the deed. Any other questions? Sincerely,\n      David E. Nicklas.2\n\n       On November 19, 2008, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging\nNicklas with transmitting a facsimile communication containing a threat to injure in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c). The indictment accused Nicklas of \"knowingly and\nwillfully\" transmitting the fax. After being indicted, Nicklas was diagnosed with\nparanoid schizophrenia and found mentally incompetent to stand trial. In April 2012,\na psychiatrist opined that Nicklas's competency had been restored by forced\nmedication. Nicklas exercised his right to a jury trial shortly thereafter. Prior to trial,\nhowever, the government moved to redact the word \"willfully\" from the indictment.\nThe government argued \"willfully\" overstated the mens rea required to prove the\ncharge and was mere surplusage in the indictment. The district court granted the\nmotion.\n\n      During the trial, Nicklas offered an instruction on the definition of reasonable\ndoubt. The district court rejected Nicklas's proffered instruction and gave the jury the\nfollowing instruction:\n\n      A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense and\n      not the mere possibility of innocence. A reasonable doubt is the kind of\n      doubt that would make a reasonable person hesitate to act. Proof beyond\n      a reasonable doubt, therefore, must be proof of such a convincing\n      character that a reasonable person would not hesitate to rely and act upon\n      it. However, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof\n      beyond all possible doubt.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        The day before this letter was faxed, Nicklas sent a letter to the Detroit FBI\noffice and the Police Department in Detroit claiming terrorists had planted a nuclear\ndevice at a U Haul storage unit in Detroit.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f      Based upon the evidence presented at trial, which included the text of the\nSeptember 28 fax to the Inspector General as well as testimony indicating government\nauthorities treated the letter as a serious threat, the jury found Nicklas guilty. He filed\na timely appeal. On appeal, he claims the district court erred when it allowed the\ngovernment to redact the word \"willfully\" from the indictment. He also contends the\nevidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Finally, he contends the district court\nabused its discretion when it rejected his proffered instruction on reasonable doubt.\n\n                                            II\n\n       We first review the challenge to the district court's order granting the\ngovernment's motion to strike the word \"willfully\" from the indictment. Nicklas\ncontends \u00a7 875(c) sets forth a specific intent crime and requires the government to\nprove he \"willfully\" made a threat. In response, the government argues \u00a7 875(c) only\nrequires proof that a defendant knowingly transmitted a communication, and that the\ncommunication contained a statement a reasonable person would perceive as a\nthreat\u2013in other words, proving the statement is a threat does not depend upon the\ndefendant's state of mind but upon how a reasonable recipient would interpret the\ndefendant's words. See, e.g., United States v. Mabie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618213\"><a href=\"/opinion/618213/united-states-v-mabie/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 (8th Cir.\n2011) (indicating a threat is a \"statement that a reasonable recipient would have\ninterpreted as a serious expression of an intent to harm or cause injury to another\")\n(citation omitted).

Most circuits have\naddressed the issue, however, and have concluded \u00a7 875(c) sets forth a general intent\ncrime which only requires the government to prove a defendant acted knowingly in\ntransmitting a communication containing a threat to injure.

In Virginia v. Black, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127908\"><a href=\"/opinion/127908/virginia-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), the Supreme Court addressed a Virginia statute that made it a felony\nto burn a cross on a highway or other public place \"with the intent of intimidating any\nperson or group.\" Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-423. In deciding whether the statute violated\nfreedom of speech rights under the First Amendment, the Supreme Court defined \"true\nthreats\" to \"encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a\nserious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence[.]\" Black, 538\nU.S. at 359. Nicklas argues this statement from Black suggests the Supreme Court\nrequires proof of the defendant's actual intent to threaten, i.e., specific intent, for any\noffense involving a threat, including a threat under \u00a7 875(c). In response, the\ngovernment argues Black is not on point because it dealt with a crime that already\n\n      3\n       The lone exception is the Ninth Circuit. See United States v. Twine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509633\"><a href=\"/opinion/509633/united-states-v-james-twine/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 679-80 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\frequired specific intent and involved a \"true threat\" analysis under the First\nAmendment rather than a mens rea requirement.\n\n       In United States v. Jeffries, the Sixth Circuit addressed the same argument\nNicklas makes and concluded Black's First Amendment \"true threat\" analysis did not\napply to the mens rea the government must establish to prove a violation of \u00a7 875(c):\n\n      Black does not work the sea change that Jeffries proposes. The case\n      merely applies\u2014it does not innovate\u2014the principle that \"[w]hat is a\n      threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected\n      speech.\" Watts, 394 U.S. at 707. It says nothing about imposing a\n      subjective standard on other threat-prohibiting statutes, and indeed had\n      no occasion to do so: the Virginia law itself required subjective \"intent.\"\n      The problem in Black thus did not turn on subjective versus objective\n      standards for construing threats. It turned on overbreadth\u2014that the\n      statute lacked any standard at all. The prima facie evidence provision\n      failed to distinguish true threats from constitutionally protected speech\n      because it \"ignore[d] all of the contextual factors that are necessary to\n      decide whether a particular cross burning is intended to intimidate,\" and\n      allowed convictions \"based solely on the fact of cross burning itself.\" Id.\n      at 365, 367.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">692</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 479-80 (6th Cir. 2012). The Sixth Circuit reasoned the general intent\ncrime set forth in \u00a7 875(c) does not ignore the context of an alleged threat because a\n\"reasonable person\" must still perceive the statement \"as a serious expression of an\nintention to inflict bodily harm.\" Id. at 480 (quoting United States v. Alkhabaz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733382\"><a href=\"/opinion/733382/united-states-v-abraham-jacob-alkhabaz-also-known-as-jake-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1495 (6th Cir. 1997)); cf.

We therefore conclude the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion when it granted the government's motion to strike\nsurplusage from the indictment. See United States v. Figueroa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539903\"><a href=\"/opinion/539903/united-states-v-pedro-victor-figueroa-united-states-of-america-v-noemi/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1218\n(8th Cir. 1990) (reviewing a motion to strike surplusage from an indictment for an\nabuse of discretion).\n\n       Nicklas next contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction,\neven if \u00a7 875(c) is a general intent crime, because the September 28 fax to the\nInspector General did not contain a statement that a reasonable recipient would\ninterpret as a serious threat to injure. We review challenges to the sufficiency of the\nevidence de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and\ngiving the verdict the benefit of all reasonable inferences. United States v. Johnson,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (8th Cir. 2012).\n\n       To sustain a conviction under \u00a7 875(c), the government was required to prove\nthe following elements: (1) Nicklas caused a transmission to be made in interstate\ncommerce; (2) he did so knowingly; and (3) the transmission contained a threat to\ninjure the person of another. See, e.g., DeAndino, 958 F.2d at 148. Nicklas stipulated\nto the first two elements, so the only issue for the jury was whether the September 28\nfax contained a statement a reasonable recipient would interpret as a threat to injure\nthe person of another. In determining whether a communication is a threat that\nviolates the statute, \"the communication must be viewed in 'textual context and also\nin the context of the totality of the circumstances in which the communication was\nmade.'\" Floyd, 458 F.3d at 849 (quoting United States v. Bellrichard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608123\"><a href=\"/opinion/608123/united-states-v-loren-francis-bellrichard/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1323 (8th Cir. 1993) (addressing an analogous violation of \u00a7 876)).\n\n      The government contends the statement Nicklas made in the September 28 fax\u2013\n\"For each day I do not receive the deed to my property which you are illegally\nholding, an FBI agent will die\"\u2013was alone sufficient to sustain the jury's conviction.\nIn addition, the government presented evidence placing the letter in context. The\n\n                                         -7-\n\fgovernment called the developer of the Rogers property as a witness, and he informed\nthe jury one of the letters he received from Nicklas said \"Do not let the FBI influence\nyour decision [to give me the deed] . . . I will take care of them.\" The government\nalso called the Benton County Prosecuting Attorney's assistant as a witness, and she\ntold the jury one of the eight letters sent to her boss accusing the county of wrongfully\nholding the deed to the Rogers property said \"Tell the FBI to take a flying leap into\nhell.\" The government also introduced evidence of the extensive investigation the FBI\ninitiated as a result of the September 28 fax, from which a jury could reasonably infer\nthe FBI took the matter very seriously. Based on these facts, we conclude the\nevidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n\n       Finally, Nicklas challenges the district court's failure to give his proffered\ninstruction on reasonable doubt. We review the district court's rejection of a proposed\ninstruction offered by a criminal defendant for an abuse of discretion. United States\nv.

The district court1\nsentenced Nicklas to forty-five months of imprisonment. Nicklas appeals his\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Jimm Larry Hendren, United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Arkansas.\n\fconviction raising three issues: (1) the district court erred when it allowed the\ngovernment to redact the word \"willfully\" from the indictment in reference to\nNicklas's state of mind when committing the crime; (2) the evidence was insufficient\nto support the verdict; and (3) the district court committed instructional error when it\nrejected Nicklas's proffered jury instruction on reasonable doubt. We affirm.\n\n                                           I\n\n       Sometime in 2008, Nicklas claims he received a vision that the mob purchased\na property on his behalf in Rogers, Arkansas (the Rogers property). Following his\nvision, Nicklas wrote a series of letters to several people demanding they give him the\ndeed to the Rogers property. The people Nicklas contacted included the developer of\nthe Rogers property; the prosecutor for Benton County, Arkansas; the agent in charge\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) office in Little Rock, Arkansas; and the\nInspector General of the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. In these letters,\nNicklas claimed he was personally responsible for costing organized crime over $1\nbillion, took credit for all the terrorists housed in Guantanamo Bay, and said he saved\nover 7,000 teenage girls who were kidnaped by the mob for prostitution and\npornography. Nicklas claimed the mob placed the Rogers property in his name to\nimplicate him in the mob's illegal activities, while at the same time claiming the mob\nintended to use the property as a drug and prostitution house.\n\n       Nicklas sent a total of four letters to the Inspector General. The third letter,\nwhich Nicklas faxed to the Inspector General on September 28, 2008, contained a\nthreat to kill FBI agents. Specifically, the letter stated the following:\n\n      Dear sir. I understand the FBI is under attack nationwide. Agents are\n      being killed in a number of cities and a major task force is trying to\n      figure out why. Remember what I told you last week. Tom Duvall,\n      Gambino crime boss, gave you a message. For each day I do not receive\n      the deed to my property which you are illegally holding, an FBI agent\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      will die. The deadline is noon of each day. The FBI satellite office in\n      Fayetteville, Arkansas has the deed. Any other questions? Sincerely,\n      David E. Nicklas.2\n\n       On November 19, 2008, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging\nNicklas with transmitting a facsimile communication containing a threat to injure in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c). The indictment accused Nicklas of \"knowingly and\nwillfully\" transmitting the fax. After being indicted, Nicklas was diagnosed with\nparanoid schizophrenia and found mentally incompetent to stand trial. In April 2012,\na psychiatrist opined that Nicklas's competency had been restored by forced\nmedication. Nicklas exercised his right to a jury trial shortly thereafter. Prior to trial,\nhowever, the government moved to redact the word \"willfully\" from the indictment.\nThe government argued \"willfully\" overstated the mens rea required to prove the\ncharge and was mere surplusage in the indictment. The district court granted the\nmotion.\n\n      During the trial, Nicklas offered an instruction on the definition of reasonable\ndoubt. The district court rejected Nicklas's proffered instruction and gave the jury the\nfollowing instruction:\n\n      A reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense and\n      not the mere possibility of innocence. A reasonable doubt is the kind of\n      doubt that would make a reasonable person hesitate to act. Proof beyond\n      a reasonable doubt, therefore, must be proof of such a convincing\n      character that a reasonable person would not hesitate to rely and act upon\n      it. However, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof\n      beyond all possible doubt.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        The day before this letter was faxed, Nicklas sent a letter to the Detroit FBI\noffice and the Police Department in Detroit claiming terrorists had planted a nuclear\ndevice at a U Haul storage unit in Detroit.\n\n                                           -3-\n\f      Based upon the evidence presented at trial, which included the text of the\nSeptember 28 fax to the Inspector General as well as testimony indicating government\nauthorities treated the letter as a serious threat, the jury found Nicklas guilty. He filed\na timely appeal. On appeal, he claims the district court erred when it allowed the\ngovernment to redact the word \"willfully\" from the indictment. He also contends the\nevidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Finally, he contends the district court\nabused its discretion when it rejected his proffered instruction on reasonable doubt.\n\n                                            II\n\n       We first review the challenge to the district court's order granting the\ngovernment's motion to strike the word \"willfully\" from the indictment. Nicklas\ncontends \u00a7 875(c) sets forth a specific intent crime and requires the government to\nprove he \"willfully\" made a threat. In response, the government argues \u00a7 875(c) only\nrequires proof that a defendant knowingly transmitted a communication, and that the\ncommunication contained a statement a reasonable person would perceive as a\nthreat\u2013in other words, proving the statement is a threat does not depend upon the\ndefendant's state of mind but upon how a reasonable recipient would interpret the\ndefendant's words. See, e.g., United States v. Mabie, 663 F.3d 322, 332 (8th Cir.\n2011) (indicating a threat is a \"statement that a reasonable recipient would have\ninterpreted as a serious expression of an intent to harm or cause injury to another\")\n(citation omitted). The government therefore argues the indictment overstated the\nmens rea for the crime charged and the word \"willfully\" was mere surplusage. See\nUnited States v. Nabors, 762 F.2d 642, 647 (8th Cir. 1985) (setting forth the general\nrule that a court may not allow an indictment to be amended, but recognizing an\nexception where the amendment merely removes surplusage from the indictment and\nthe remaining allegations correctly state the essential elements of an offense); United\nStates v. Holmes, 594 F.2d 1167, 1173 (8th Cir. 1979) (indicating language in an\nindictment overstating the mental state for the crime charged constitutes mere\nsurplusage).\n\n                                           -4-\n\f       Although the Eighth Circuit has addressed this same issue for an analogous\ncharge under \u00a7 876(c), see United States v. Koski, 424 F.3d 812, 817 (8th Cir. 2005)\n(concluding the \"intent of the sender is not an element of the offense\"), we have not\nyet directly addressed whether \u00a7 875(c) is a specific intent crime that requires the\ngovernment to prove the defendant's subjective intentions. Most circuits have\naddressed the issue, however, and have concluded \u00a7 875(c) sets forth a general intent\ncrime which only requires the government to prove a defendant acted knowingly in\ntransmitting a communication containing a threat to injure. See United States v.\nWhiffen, 121 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Francis, 164 F.3d 120, 121-\n22 (2nd Cir. 1999); United States v. Himelwright, 42 F.3d 777, 782-83 (3rd Cir.\n1994); United States v. Darby, 37 F.3d 1059, 1066 (4th Cir. 1994); United States v.\nMeyers, 104 F.3d 76, 81 (5th Cir. 1997); United States v. DeAndino, 958 F.2d 146,\n148-49 (6th Cir. 1992); United States v. Stewart, 411 F.3d 825, 828 (7th Cir. 2005);\nUnited States v. Teague, 443 F.3d 1310, 1319 (10th Cir. 2006).3\n\n       Undaunted by the deck of circuit precedent stacked heavily against him, Nicklas\nargues his fate is controlled by a Supreme Court decision. In Virginia v. Black, 538\nU.S. 343 (2003), the Supreme Court addressed a Virginia statute that made it a felony\nto burn a cross on a highway or other public place \"with the intent of intimidating any\nperson or group.\" Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-423. In deciding whether the statute violated\nfreedom of speech rights under the First Amendment, the Supreme Court defined \"true\nthreats\" to \"encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a\nserious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence[.]\" Black, 538\nU.S. at 359. Nicklas argues this statement from Black suggests the Supreme Court\nrequires proof of the defendant's actual intent to threaten, i.e., specific intent, for any\noffense involving a threat, including a threat under \u00a7 875(c). In response, the\ngovernment argues Black is not on point because it dealt with a crime that already\n\n      3\n       The lone exception is the Ninth Circuit. See United States v. Twine, 853 F.2d\n676, 679-80 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\frequired specific intent and involved a \"true threat\" analysis under the First\nAmendment rather than a mens rea requirement.\n\n       In United States v. Jeffries, the Sixth Circuit addressed the same argument\nNicklas makes and concluded Black's First Amendment \"true threat\" analysis did not\napply to the mens rea the government must establish to prove a violation of \u00a7 875(c):\n\n      Black does not work the sea change that Jeffries proposes. The case\n      merely applies\u2014it does not innovate\u2014the principle that \"[w]hat is a\n      threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected\n      speech.\" Watts, 394 U.S. at 707. It says nothing about imposing a\n      subjective standard on other threat-prohibiting statutes, and indeed had\n      no occasion to do so: the Virginia law itself required subjective \"intent.\"\n      The problem in Black thus did not turn on subjective versus objective\n      standards for construing threats. It turned on overbreadth\u2014that the\n      statute lacked any standard at all. The prima facie evidence provision\n      failed to distinguish true threats from constitutionally protected speech\n      because it \"ignore[d] all of the contextual factors that are necessary to\n      decide whether a particular cross burning is intended to intimidate,\" and\n      allowed convictions \"based solely on the fact of cross burning itself.\" Id.\n      at 365, 367.\n\n692 F.3d 473, 479-80 (6th Cir. 2012). The Sixth Circuit reasoned the general intent\ncrime set forth in \u00a7 875(c) does not ignore the context of an alleged threat because a\n\"reasonable person\" must still perceive the statement \"as a serious expression of an\nintention to inflict bodily harm.\" Id. at 480 (quoting United States v. Alkhabaz, 104\nF.3d 1492, 1495 (6th Cir. 1997)); cf. United States v. Floyd, 458 F.3d 844, 848 (8th\nCir. 2006) (rejecting Black's application to a mens rea analysis under \u00a7 876(c)).\n\n       We agree with the sound reasoning in Jeffries, and now join the other circuits\nthat have concluded \u00a7 875(c) does not require the government to prove a defendant\nspecifically intended his or her statements to be threatening, but rather requires the\ngovernment to prove a reasonable recipient would have interpreted the defendant's\n\n                                         -6-\n\fcommunication as a serious threat to injure. We therefore conclude the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion when it granted the government's motion to strike\nsurplusage from the indictment. See United States v. Figueroa, 900 F.2d 1211, 1218\n(8th Cir. 1990) (reviewing a motion to strike surplusage from an indictment for an\nabuse of discretion).\n\n       Nicklas next contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction,\neven if \u00a7 875(c) is a general intent crime, because the September 28 fax to the\nInspector General did not contain a statement that a reasonable recipient would\ninterpret as a serious threat to injure. We review challenges to the sufficiency of the\nevidence de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and\ngiving the verdict the benefit of all reasonable inferences. United States v. Johnson,\n688 F.3d 494, 502 (8th Cir. 2012).\n\n       To sustain a conviction under \u00a7 875(c), the government was required to prove\nthe following elements: (1) Nicklas caused a transmission to be made in interstate\ncommerce; (2) he did so knowingly; and (3) the transmission contained a threat to\ninjure the person of another. See, e.g., DeAndino, 958 F.2d at 148. Nicklas stipulated\nto the first two elements, so the only issue for the jury was whether the September 28\nfax contained a statement a reasonable recipient would interpret as a threat to injure\nthe person of another. In determining whether a communication is a threat that\nviolates the statute, \"the communication must be viewed in 'textual context and also\nin the context of the totality of the circumstances in which the communication was\nmade.'\" Floyd, 458 F.3d at 849 (quoting United States v. Bellrichard, 994 F.2d 1318,\n1323 (8th Cir. 1993) (addressing an analogous violation of \u00a7 876)).\n\n      The government contends the statement Nicklas made in the September 28 fax\u2013\n\"For each day I do not receive the deed to my property which you are illegally\nholding, an FBI agent will die\"\u2013was alone sufficient to sustain the jury's conviction.\nIn addition, the government presented evidence placing the letter in context. The\n\n                                         -7-\n\fgovernment called the developer of the Rogers property as a witness, and he informed\nthe jury one of the letters he received from Nicklas said \"Do not let the FBI influence\nyour decision [to give me the deed] . . . I will take care of them.\" The government\nalso called the Benton County Prosecuting Attorney's assistant as a witness, and she\ntold the jury one of the eight letters sent to her boss accusing the county of wrongfully\nholding the deed to the Rogers property said \"Tell the FBI to take a flying leap into\nhell.\" The government also introduced evidence of the extensive investigation the FBI\ninitiated as a result of the September 28 fax, from which a jury could reasonably infer\nthe FBI took the matter very seriously. Based on these facts, we conclude the\nevidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n\n       Finally, Nicklas challenges the district court's failure to give his proffered\ninstruction on reasonable doubt. We review the district court's rejection of a proposed\ninstruction offered by a criminal defendant for an abuse of discretion. United States\nv. Beale, 620 F.3d 856, 866 (8th Cir. 2010). We find no abuse of discretion here,\nbecause Nicklas's challenge is foreclosed by circuit precedent.
