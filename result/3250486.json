During the interval he drank considerable whiskey.</p>\n<p>The testimony of Miss Margie Pitts, an admitted accomplice, clearly makes the accused a guilty participant in the crime. The motion to exclude the evidence was properly overruled if her testiomny was corroborated.</p>\n<p>Pertinent to this inquiry is the evidence of Mr. Davidson. He gave testimony which in effect disclosed that during his association with the accused ample opportunity was afforded for the appellant to know that the money was contained in a purse which the witness carried in his pocket.</p>\n<p>Finally the party went to a cabin at a roadside inn. According to the testimony of the accomplice, while the party was in the cabin and under the pretense of affection, she took the money out of the pocket of the victim. This, she said, was in keeping with the scheme which she and the appellant had made prior thereto.</p>\n<p>Mr. Davidson testified that he had his money after he entered the cabin. Soon thereafter he passed out completely. When he awoke several hours later, his money was missing, and the appellant and the girl had gone.</p>\n<p>We have also the testimony of the taxi driver. It appears that among the funds taken from the purse was a one-hundred dollar bill. The taxi driver testified that he carried the appellant and the girl from the cabin to Huntsville. En route he observed the indicated bill in the possession of the couple and heard them discussing plans to have it changed and divided. When he reached Huntsville he let the appellant out of his car near a bank. The passenger later returned, and witness carried the couple to another point in the city where they <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 278</span> \ndisembarked. The appellant paid him $5.00 for his taxi service and also $5.00 as a tip. These details were in harmony with the testimony of the accomplice.</p>\n<p>The doctrine of instant concern has been often discussed by our appellate courts. In the fairly recent case of Allen v. State, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3247059\"><a href=\"/opinion/3245431/allen-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.

It is not necessary to enter into any discussion of the matter to illustrate the soundness of this view. The following authorities are among the many which support our conclusion. Horn v.

The general affirmative charge was properly refused.</p>\n<p>Charges 1 and 11 were each substantially covered by the court's oral charge, and refused charge 20 is in effect the same as given charge number 23. Title 7, Sec. 273, Code 1940.</p>\n<p>Refused charges A and B do not take into account that the indictment also contained a count predicating the offense of receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p>Charge number 3 omits to include the doctrine of aiding and abetting. The guilt of the defendant did not depend solely upon proof that he actually took the property from the person of Mr. Davidson. In fact, the evidence tends to show that the accomplice was the guilty person in this respect. However, there is ample evidence to sustain a conviction of the appellant by the application of the rule of aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p>The conviction of the accused did not depend altogether on circumstantial evidence. Hence charges 9 and 15 were properly refused.</p>\n<p>Refused charge 13 was approved in some of the early cases. Cohen v. State, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ala.</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></span></cross_reference>; Porter v.

Whether or not a witness is unworthy of credit or belief addresses itself to a finding by the jury and not by the court. For the court to instruct, as a matter of law, that the jury cannot convict on such testimony unless it is corroborated is clearly without the province of the trial judge. Later authorities have sensed the vice of the charge and have approved its refusal. Moore v.
