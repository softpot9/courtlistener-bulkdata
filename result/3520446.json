Case,  for appellant.\n\nThe indictment had no specific date laid in it, being a charge that the defendant sold intoxicating liquor on \"the ____ day of ____, A.D., 1925, in the county aforesaid.\" This being true, the state could give evidence of only one sale anterior to the year 1925. More than one sale is inadmissible under such an indictment. Section 2098, Hemingway's Code (section 1762, Code of 1906);  Cage  v.  State,   105 Miss. 326 , 62 So. 358. It is reversible error for the court to admit evidence of more than one sale over defendant's objection.\n\nThe witness Arthur Harrington denied that he had any knowledge of having bought whiskey from the appellant at the ice house on Christmas Eve night, but was permitted to testify in response to the leading and argumentative questions of the district attorney as to another sale some time in the previous summer. For this error this case should be reversed.\n\n W.A. Scott,  Special Agent, for the state.\n\nThe admission of evidence of two distinct sales was not error because it was cured by forcing the state to elect. Evidence was introduced by the state showing two separate sales, the first being on Christmas Eve and the second in the summer of 1924. The defendant made a motion to require the state to elect on which sale it would stand and the state elected the sale on Christmas Eve at the ice house. The defendant received an instruction telling the jury they could convict only for the sale made on the above date. If the court committed error in admitting evidence of two sales, this error was cured by requiring the state to elect and by instructing the jury as to the only sale on which they could predicate a conviction.\n\n H.F. Case,  in reply, for appellant.\n\nThis case should be reversed for the error of the court below in admitting evidence, over appellant's timely objection,\nof more than one sale of liquor.  Cage  v.  State,   105 Miss. 326 , 62 So. 358;  Maxey  v.  State,   106 So. 353 ;  Prine  v. State,   107 So. 280 . This court has positively stated that where in an indictment for the sale of liquor no specific date is laid, evidence of more than one sale cannot be given.\n\nIt is true that after all the evidence was in, appellant made a motion that the court require the state to elect upon which sale the state would ask a conviction; but, I submit, by so doing the appellant did not waive his objection to the incompetent evidence which had been already admitted. He had a right to know upon which alleged sale the state would ask a conviction before he put in his defense. When no specific date is laid in the indictment, it is equivalent to a charge of a single sale and under the law before the enactment of section 1762, Code of 1906, the rule was that a defendant had the right to demand that the court compel the state to elect a particular sale on which it relied and confine it's testimony to that sale. See  Kittrell  v.  State,  89 Miss. 666 , 42 So. 609. The fact that the state is required to elect does not cure the error of admitting more than one sale when the defendant is tried for an alleged single sale.  Ware et  al.  v.  State,  13 So. 936.\n\nBy parity of reason to that in  Riddick  v.  State,   72 Miss. 100 , 16 So. 490, I contend that the court's action in sustaining the defendant's motion to require the state to elect and the instruction telling the jury that they could convict only on the one sale did not undo the wrong done the defendant by the admission of incompetent evidence.", "CL_cluster_date_modified": "2017-04-14T23:58:56.468658Z", "CL_cluster_docket": {"CL_docket_assigned_to": null, "CL_docket_assigned_to_str": "", "CL_docket_resource_uri": "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/dockets/3419615/", "CL_docket_referred_to": null, "CL_docket_clusters": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/3547490/"], "CL_docket_case_name": "Voss v.
