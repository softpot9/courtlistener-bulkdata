We\naffirm.\n\n       Plaintiff filed this divorce action after a nearly 20-year marriage. Although defendant\napparently participated in various pretrial conferences and discussed the terms of the divorce\njudgment, he did not answer the complaint, a default was entered, and a default judgment was\nrequested. After multiple adjournments, a hearing to enter the default judgment was held on\nSeptember 28, 2015. With a correction of an error in the judgment presented to the trial court at\nthe hearing, the trial judge entered the judgment presented by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. Defendant now\nappeals.\n\n        Defendant first argues that the trial court improperly entered the default judgment without\naffording him the opportunity to be heard. Defendant relies upon this Court\u2019s opinion in Perry v\nPerry, 176 Mich App 762, 767-768; 440 NW2d 93 (1989), for the proposition that, even after a\ndefault, a defendant has the right to participate in the hearing to determine the terms of the\njudgment. But this Court in Dragoo v Dragoo, 223 Mich App 415, 427-428; 566 NW2d 642\n(1997), concluded that Perry was incorrectly decided because that principle only applies to cases\nwhere the defaulted defendant would have had a right to a jury trial and, therefore, does not\napply to equitable actions such as a divorce case. Defendant only cites to an unpublished\ndecision of this Court for the proposition that Dragoo only applies where the default is the result\nof a discovery sanction and does not apply where the default was for failing to appear. We need\nnot resolve this question, however, because the record does not support defendant\u2019s contention\nthat he was not allowed to participate in the hearing.\n\n\n\n                                                -1-\n\f        Defendant attended the September 28 hearing. Plaintiff was called as a witness and, after\nthe direct examination by plaintiff\u2019s attorney was finished, the trial judge asked defendant \u201cdo\nyou have any questions for your wife?\u201d Defendant responded that he did not. Defendant was\nthen sworn and asked questions by the trial court. Defendant stated his objections to the\njudgment. There is no indication from the record that the trial court prevented defendant from\nmaking any argument that he wished or from presenting evidence. In short, even assuming that\nDragoo does not apply to this case and that, under Perry, defendant had the right to fully\nparticipate in the hearing, he was not precluded from doing so.\n\n        Next, defendant argues that entry of the judgment was improper because plaintiff failed\nto comply with MCR 3.210(B)(4)(a), which requires, among other things, that the plaintiff must,\n14 days before the hearing, serve on the defendant a copy of the proposed default judgment.\nAlthough defendant acknowledges that a copy of a proposed judgment was served on him at\nleast 14 days before the hearing, he claims that the proposed judgment presented to the trial court\ndiffered from the proposed judgment that had been served on him.\n\n        There are two problems with analyzing this argument. First, while defendant attaches to\nhis brief on appeal a copy of what he claims to have been the proposed judgment sent to him, no\ncopy of that judgment appears in the record. Our review is limited to the record created in the\ntrial court. MCR 7.210. Indeed, the only indication in the record regarding the proposed\njudgment as sent to defendant is the following exchange at the hearing:\n\n       THE COURT: Thank you. Mr. Jones, have you seen the judgment?\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: I have not.\n\n       [Plaintiff\u2019s counsel]: It\u2019s the one I mailed to you with the notice of this hearing.\n\n       THE DEFENDANT: Then yes.\n\nTherefore, the record before us can only establish that defendant was properly served a copy of\nthe proposed judgment.\n\n        Second, defendant did not raise any objections at the hearing, nor move to set aside the\ndefault judgment, based upon this claim. Therefore, the issue has not been properly preserved\nfor appeal. Booth Newspapers, Inc v Univ of Mich Bd of Regents, 444 Mich 211, 234; 507\nNW2d 422 (1993).\n\n       Finally, defendant argues that the default judgment should be vacated because the\nproperty division was inequitable. We disagree. We affirm property distribution decisions in\ndivorce cases unless we are left with a firm conviction that the distribution was inequitable.\nHanaway v Hanaway, 208 Mich App 278, 292; 527 NW2d 792 (1995). Although defendant\nmakes representations in his brief as to the valuations, including the attachment of documents\nand an affidavit, there is no evidence in the trial court record to establish the valuations or the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\fextent of any inequality in the distribution. Nor, for that matter, was there any discussion as to\nthe reasons for the distribution, other than a question to plaintiff by her attorney to confirm that\nshe had originally asked for 75%1 of defendant\u2019s pension \u201cto cover some of the other inequities\nin this.\u201d In any event, based upon the scant record before us, we are not left with a firm\nconviction that the distribution is inequitable.\n\n         Affirmed.
