Marrero challenges findings of fact about the extent of his misconduct,\n\nthe calculation of the amount of loss, and the enhancement of his sentence for his\n\nleadership role. We affirm.\n\n      The district court did not clearly err in its factual findings about Marrero\u2019s\n\ncrimes. The district court relied on the evidence that it had heard at trial and\n\nselected a base offense level for Marrero\u2019s conviction of defrauding Medicare.\n\nThe evidence established that Marrero incorporated and later operated Tendercare\n\nthrough counseling his wife, to whom he transferred the business after their\n\ndivorce, and through his relationship with Keith Russell, whom Marrero hired to\n\nmanage Tendercare. At Marrero\u2019s direction, Tendercare submitted to Medicare\n\nfalse invoices for treatments of patients allegedly suffering from human\n\nimmunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, including\n\nMarrero\u2019s aunt. Marrero recruited patients, instructed his wife to order\n\nmedication, taught her about Medicare procedures, recruited Jorge Pacheco to\n\nfalsify blood tests, falsified and trained Eda Milanes and others to falsify blood\n\nsamples, signed \u201ctherapy pages\u201d that recorded dosages of medication allegedly\n\nadministered to patients, received payment from Tendercare for treatment\n\nallegedly administered to his aunt, and counseled his wife to pay patients\n\n                                          2\n\fkickbacks from Tendercare\u2019s illegal profits.
