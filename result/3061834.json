Marrero challenges findings of fact about the extent of his misconduct,\n\nthe calculation of the amount of loss, and the enhancement of his sentence for his\n\nleadership role. We affirm.\n\n      The district court did not clearly err in its factual findings about Marrero\u2019s\n\ncrimes. The district court relied on the evidence that it had heard at trial and\n\nselected a base offense level for Marrero\u2019s conviction of defrauding Medicare.\n\nThe evidence established that Marrero incorporated and later operated Tendercare\n\nthrough counseling his wife, to whom he transferred the business after their\n\ndivorce, and through his relationship with Keith Russell, whom Marrero hired to\n\nmanage Tendercare. At Marrero\u2019s direction, Tendercare submitted to Medicare\n\nfalse invoices for treatments of patients allegedly suffering from human\n\nimmunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, including\n\nMarrero\u2019s aunt. Marrero recruited patients, instructed his wife to order\n\nmedication, taught her about Medicare procedures, recruited Jorge Pacheco to\n\nfalsify blood tests, falsified and trained Eda Milanes and others to falsify blood\n\nsamples, signed \u201ctherapy pages\u201d that recorded dosages of medication allegedly\n\nadministered to patients, received payment from Tendercare for treatment\n\nallegedly administered to his aunt, and counseled his wife to pay patients\n\n                                          2\n\fkickbacks from Tendercare\u2019s illegal profits. Marrero complains that evidence\n\nabout his role in a conspiracy to defraud was used to determine his sentence, but\n\nthe district court was entitled to consider all conduct relevant to Marrero\u2019s crimes,\n\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.3 (2009), including conduct\n\nfor which Marrero was acquitted, see United States v. Culver, 598 F.3d 740, 752\n\n(11th Cir. 2010).\n\n      The district court also did not clearly err in determining the amount of loss.\n\nMarrero argues that he was held accountable for a loss between $7 and $20\n\nmillion, but the district court attributed to Marrero a loss between $2.5 and $7\n\nmillion. The district court took into account Marrero\u2019s misconduct and \u201call\n\nreasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of\u201d the scheme\n\nto defraud Medicare, U.S.S.G \u00a7 1B1.3(a), and relied on the undisputed testimony\n\nof Marrero\u2019s wife that Medicare was billed approximately $5.8 million in\n\nfraudulent claims. Moreover, Marrero admits that \u201cthe evidence at trial showed\n\nthat . . . the amount that was paid by Medicare [to Tendercare] . . . was\n\n$2,743,473.80.\u201d\n\n      The district court likewise did not clearly err when it enhanced Marrero\u2019s\n\nsentence based on his role as a leader in the scheme to defraud. A defendant is\n\nsubject to a four-level enhancement of his sentence for serving as an \u201corganizer or\n\n                                          3\n\fleader\u201d of a criminal activity \u201cthat involved five or more participants or was\n\notherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(a). Facts relevant to a determination that\n\nan individual is a leader or organizer include his \u201cexercise of decision making\n\nauthority,\u201d his participation in and \u201cdegree of participation in planning or\n\norganizing the offense, . . . [his] recruitment of accomplices, . . . and the degree of\n\ncontrol and authority [he] exercised over others.\u201d Id. cmt. n.4. Marrero does not\n\ndispute that his offense involved more than five participants. The evidence\n\nestablished that Marrero founded and later instructed his wife how to operate\n\nTendercare, established a bank account for Tendercare, falsified test results and\n\npaperwork, and recruited patients and staff to defraud Medicare. See United\n\nStates v. Ndiaye, 434 F.3d 1270, 1304 (11th Cir. 2006). Although Marrero\u2019s wife\n\nhad a significant role in the fraud, Marrero orchestrated the scheme to defraud.\n\n      We AFFIRM Marrero\u2019s sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f", "ML_Tags": [], "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "Case_No": "10-13695", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                            [DO NOT PUBLISH]\n\n               IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n\n                        FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                         ________________________                  FILED\n                                                          U.S. COURT OF APPEALS\n                                No. 10-13695                ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                            Non-Argument Calendar              AUGUST 15, 2011\n                          ________________________               JOHN LEY\n                                                                  CLERK\n                      D.C.
