In order to \r\ninvestigate the noise, Officer Davis followed the vehicle in her police car.   As Officer\r\nDavis neared the vehicle, she observed the vehicle accelerate and run through a\r\nstoplight.  Officer Davis activated her lights and siren to initiate a stop, but the\r\n4Runner continued driving erratically as it turned into a residential neighborhood. \r\nOfficer Davis observed appellant in the passenger side of the vehicle, waving a gun\r\nin the Officer\u2019s direction.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Sergeant Eissler, also with the Meadows Police Department, joined the pursuit\r\nafter hearing Officer Davis say over the radio that a passenger in a vehicle pointed a\r\ngun at her.  Sergeant Eissler accelerated in his vehicle to catch up to the 4Runner. \r\nSergeant Eissler saw the driver, Joseph Flores, pull out a gun and fire it in the\r\ndirection of the Sergeant.  Sergeant Eissler was shot in the shoulder, but despite being\r\nwounded, returned fire on the 4Runner.  Officer Davis stopped to aid Sergeant\r\nEissler, but he told Officer Davis to continue the pursuit of the suspects. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Appellant and Flores pulled into a gas station.  Jeff Drescher was at the station\r\nwhen he heard gunshots and saw the 4Runner and a police car come speeding into the\r\nstation.  Drescher ducked behind his truck.  The 4Runner stopped in front of\r\nDrescher\u2019s truck, and Flores got out of the 4Runner pointing a gun at Drescher and\r\nscreaming something at him.  Drescher started to back away from his truck.  Flores\r\ngot into the driver\u2019s seat, followed by appellant, who jumped in the driver side and\r\ncrawled over Flores to the passenger seat.  Drescher testified that appellant \u201cvery\r\nwillingly\u201d went with Flores into the vehicle.  Flores started the truck and sped off.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Officer Davis followed in </span></span><span><span>pursuit of the truck.  Several other patrol cars joined\r\nthe chase, including Sergeant Mike Waller of the Fort Bend County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \r\nEventually, Sergeant Waller got close enough to the pickup truck to see inside the\r\nvehicle.  Sergeant Waller saw appellant point a gun at him and fire \u201ca couple of\r\nrounds.\u201d  As the chase continued, appellant shot several more rounds at Sergeant\r\nWaller, at one point leaning out of the passenger window of the truck to take aim at\r\nhim.  In an effort to disable to vehicle, Sergeant Waller fired shots into the cab of the\r\ntruck, shattering the back window.  Appellant continued to fire at Sergeant Waller\r\nseveral more times through the shattered back window.  As the pickup truck entered\r\nthe feeder road of Highway 59, Sergeant Waller shot out the back tire, causing the\r\nvehicle to lose control and slam into a retaining wall on a bridge.  Flores immediately\r\nexited the vehicle and jumped off of the bridge, but appellant remained stuck in the\r\ntruck because she could not open the door.  As Sergeant Waller approached the\r\nvehicle, he noticed a gun near appellant\u2019s leg and instructed her to put her hands up\r\nand away from the gun.  Appellant put her hands up but then starting swinging her\r\nhands and kicking her feet.  Sergeant Waller pulled the door open, but appellant\r\nrefused to get out of the truck and had to be forcibly removed from the vehicle. \r\nAppellant was uncooperative, aggressive, and unresponsive to simple questions such\r\nas her name.  Officer Davis accompanied appellant to the hospital and described\r\nappellant\u2019s demeanor as hostile and angry.  At the hospital, appellant mumbled,\r\n\u201cF***ing bi*** almost shot me; and shot her, and found the other gun.\u201d </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Max Hunter, a crime scene investigator, testified to the location of the firearms\r\nthat were recovered.  A Glock Model 27 handgun was found in plain view in the front\r\npassenger seat of the pickup truck.  A Ruger 9-millimeter pistol was found on the\r\nfloorboard of the front passenger side of the pickup truck.  Both the Glock and the\r\nRuger were loaded and not secured by the safety.  Lastly, a Titan FIE .25 automatic\r\npistol was found empty in the front right passenger floorboard of the 4Runner.  It is\r\nuncontradicted that appellant was seated in the front passenger seat of the 4Runner\r\nand the pickup truck.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>At trial, the jury was shown video footage taken from the dash cameras of two\r\npolice officers and video taken by news station KHOU.  The videos clearly show the\r\nchase and appellant taking aim and firing at Sergeant Waller.  </span></span><span><span>Results of a gunshot\r\nresidue test presented at trial showed that appellant\u2019s right hand palm and left hand\r\nback were positive for gunshot residue.<span>\u00a0</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Appellant testified that Flores was her boyfriend and they both liked the same\r\ndrugs.  Describing herself as a drug addict, appellant told the jury, \u201c[Y]ou do what\r\nyou do to get your drugs.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it hurts your family, your friends, or any\r\nof y\u2019all.\u201d  </span></span><span><span>Appellant testified that she and Flores had a \u201cpattern\u201d of stealing from\r\npeople; appellant would solicit clients for prostitution, lead the victim to a planned\r\nlocation, and appellant, together with Flores, would steal the victim\u2019s money, car, or\r\nwhatever they needed.  Appellant admitted that she and Flores targeted Hispanic\r\nmales because \u201cthey\u2019re illegals, they don\u2019t like calling the police.\u201d  </span></span><span><span>Appellant testified\r\nthat on May 28, just four days prior to the day in question, appellant and Flores used\r\nthis plan to steal the 4Runner they were driving on the day of the incident.   </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Appellant testified that, in the hours leading up to the incident, she had smoked\r\nmarijuana, snorted cocaine, and smoked crack cocaine with Flores.  Appellant\r\ntestified the rent on their hotel room was due so they planned to rob someone in\r\nHouston.  At approximately 9:00 a.m. on June 2, 2006, appellant testified she\r\napproached a man in a car offering him prostitution services.  Appellant got into the\r\nman\u2019s car and directed him to a location to park.  After the man parked, Flores walked\r\nup to the passenger side of his vehicle and told appellant to get out of the car.  Flores\r\nthen got into the man\u2019s car and argued with the man.  As the man exited his car,\r\nFlores grabbed the man\u2019s wallet.  Because of the man\u2019s abruptness exiting his car,\r\nappellant testified she thought the man was going to push her.  Appellant testified she\r\nreacted by hitting the man in the head with the butt of a .25 caliber gun, causing his\r\nhead to bleed.  Appellant got in the 4Runner and drove off with Flores but testified\r\nshe does not remember much after this point.  Appellant stated that she remembered\r\nhearing a noise coming from the 4Runner but did not recall getting in a wreck. \r\nAppellant remembered driving past Officer Davis because Flores was \u201cfreaking out\u201d\r\nwhen the officer began to follow them.  Appellant stated that Flores sped up and was\r\nnot paying attention to stop signs or lights. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Appellant testified she did not recall waving a gun at Officer Davis.  Appellant\r\nalso does not recall seeing Flores shoot Sergeant Eissler.  Appellant testified she did\r\nnot see Flores point the gun at Drescher when they stole the pickup truck from the gas\r\nstation, and said she just followed Flores into the truck.   </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Appellant admitted to shooting at Sergeant Waller but said that she did so\r\nbecause Flores was yelling at her to shoot him.  On cross-examination, appellant\r\nadmitted that, following her arrest, she did not tell police she felt threatened by\r\nFlores.  Also, o</span></span><span><span>n cross-examination, appellant admitted that she and Flores were\r\ninvolved in a previous police chase in 2005.</span></span><span><span><span>II.  </span></span></span><span><span>Sufficiency of the Evidence</span></span><span><span>Appellant argues that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to\r\nsupport her convictions for (1) aggravated robbery and (2) attempted capital murder\r\nof a peace officer.</span></span><span><span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>A.<span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Standard of Review</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><i><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span></span></i></span></span><span><span>In our legal-sufficiency review, we view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the verdict and ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found\r\nthe crime\u2019s essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.  <i>Johnson v.

We will set aside the verdict for factual insufficiency only if (1) the\r\nevidence is so weak that the verdict is clearly wrong and manifestly unjust or (2) the\r\nproof of guilt is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. \r\n<i>Johnson</i>, 23 S.W.3d at 11.   Under the first prong of <i>Johnson</i>, we cannot conclude\r\nthat a conviction is \u201cclearly wrong\u201d or \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d simply because, on the\r\nquantum of evidence admitted, we would have voted to acquit had we been on the\r\njury.  <i>Watson v.

Crim. App. 2006).  Under the\r\nsecond prong of <i>Johnson</i>, we also cannot declare that a conflict in the evidence\r\njustifies a new trial simply because we disagree with the jury\u2019s resolution of that\r\nconflict.  <i>Id. </i> Before finding that evidence is factually insufficient to support a verdict\r\nunder the second prong of <i>Johnson</i>, we must be able to say, with some objective basis\r\nin the record, that the great weight and preponderance of the evidence contradicts the\r\njury\u2019s verdict.  <i>Id.  </i>In our factual-sufficiency review, we must also discuss the\r\nevidence that, according to appellant, most undermines the jury\u2019s verdict.  <i>Sims v.\r\nState</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1984885\"><a href=\"/opinion/1984885/sims-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 603 (Tex.

Her testimony showed that Flores was her boyfriend, that they\r\nused drugs together, and they had a pattern of planning and executing crimes\r\ntogether.

Presuming appellant is arguing (contrary to her own testimony) that she did\r\nnot know she was shooting at a police officer, her assertion does not make the\r\nevidence factually insufficient.  At trial appellant testified that she remembered\r\ndriving past Officer Davis because Flores was \u201cfreaking out\u201d when the officer began\r\nto follow them.  This testimony makes clear that she knew she and Flores were being\r\nfollowed by police earlier in the chase.  Also, she admitted on cross examination that\r\nshe knew she was in the middle of a high speed chase, even calling it a \u201cpolice chase\u201d\r\nin her testimony.  </span></span><span><span>Thus, the jury was free to discredit appellant\u2019s testimony that she\r\ndid not know she was being chased by lights and sirens.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Appellant argues that, while the State may have proved that appellant fired a\r\ngun near Sergeant Waller, the evidence is nonetheless insufficient to prove that a\r\nprojectile was discharged from appellant\u2019s firearm and that she intended to shoot at\r\nWaller rather than one of the other officers or at his vehicle.  Specifically, appellant\r\ncites to Sergeant Waller\u2019s testimony that the pistol was pointed \u201cin the direction of the\r\npatrol cars.\u201d</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  </span></span><span><span>Additionally, Sergeant Waller testified that no bullets actually struck\r\nhim or his patrol car to his knowledge.  However, evidence and testimony was\r\npresented that make the jury\u2019s finding reasonable.  The jury heard appellant admit that\r\nshe shot at Sergeant Waller and the other officers.  Appellant\u2019s hands tested positive\r\nfor gunshot residue.  Further, Sergeant Waller testified that he knew appellant was\r\nactually trying to shoot him because he saw the muzzle of the gun pointed in his\r\ndirection.  </span></span><span><span>Thus, Sergeant Waller\u2019s testimony is clear evidence that appellant was\r\nshooting at him specifically.  Appellant is correct in noting that Sergeant Waller\u2019s\r\ntestimony may also suggest that appellant shot at other officers.  But even if true, that\r\nwould not absolve appellant of guilt for attempted capital murder of Sergeant Waller. \r\nRather, that fact would make appellant also guilty of attempted capital murder of the\r\nother officers.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Weighed in a neutral light, the evidence</span></span><span><span> is not so weak that the verdict is clearly\r\nwrong and unjust.  <i><span>Laster v.
