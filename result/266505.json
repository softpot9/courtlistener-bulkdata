The district court had jurisdiction of the action under 301(a) of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U.S.C. 185(a); we have jurisdiction of the appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1291, Farr &amp; Co. v. Cia.  Intercontinental de Navegacion, etc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"241950\"><a href=\"/opinion/241950/farr-co-a-partnership-of-which-f-s-farr-john-farr-w-f-prescott/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 344-345 (2 Cir. 1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is not disputed that the controversy over the discharge was within the collective bargaining agreement's broad provisions for the arbitration of disputes.  Appellant's contention hinges on another clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Notiace of intention to arbitrate any grievance shall be given by either party to the other within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of the other party's answer at Step 3 of the grievance procedure or the grievance will be considered closed and the grieving party foreclosed from taking the grievance to arbitration.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company's answer at Step 3 was filed on August 27, 1962, but the union did not give written notice of its intention to arbitrate until June 17, 1963.  An affidavit by the president of the local asserted that in October, 1962, within 60 days of August 27, it sought, seemingly not in writing, an extension of the 60-day period pending an appeal by the employee from the criminal conviction the arrest leading to which had been a basis for his discharge, and that it made a request for arbitration, also apparently oral, on March 26, 1963, some three weeks after the conviction was reversed.  On these facts the district judge held that the question of timely demand was for the arbitrator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rochester seeks to distinguish the statement in John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v.

As a second line of defense, the company stresses the contract language, not paralleled in the agreements in Wiley or in Carey, that failure to make timely demand shall mean not only that 'the grievance will be considered closed' but that 'the grieving party (will be) foreclosed from taking the grievance to arbitration.'  Assuming in Rochester's favor that a court will not order arbitration when the intended preclusive effect of a procedural provision and the fact of breach are both so plain that no rational mind could hurdle the barrier, cf.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span>, we do not think Rochester meets that severe test.  An arbitrator might-- or might not-- find, if the claims in the union's affidavit are established, that its October, 1962, request was in practical import an invocation of arbitration coupled with a suggestion that appointment of the arbitrator and a hearing be deferred until the employee's appeal was decided-- an issue on which the history of the parties' arbitral dealings might throw significant light.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge inserted a provision in the order making clear that the company 'shall be entitled to present before the arbitrator its defense that the plaintiff did not notice the case for arbitration in a timely manner * * *.'  The company asks us, if we should overrule its main contention, to direct the arbitrator to hear and determine the issue of timeliness in the first instance.
