Dailey appeals the district court\u2019s orders\ngranting summary judgment for Shintech. Because Dailey\u2019s evidence fails to\nestablish a genuine issue of material fact, we AFFIRM.\n                                             I.\n       Dailey, who is African-American, worked for Shintech at Shintech\u2019s\nFreeport, Texas, chemical plant from 1990 until July 2012 when his\n\n\n       \u2217\n         Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion\nshould not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set\nforth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 15-20147    Document: 00513257429    Page: 2   Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                No. 15-20147\n\nemployment with Shintech was terminated. Dailey argues that several events\nat Shintech between August 2010 and July 2012 constitute employment\ndiscrimination based on race.\n      During that time, Dailey made two complaints to Shintech\u2019s human\nresources department (HR). First, Dailey made an oral complaint to HR in\nAugust 2010 about a co-worker who Dailey alleged was improperly taking\nreadings in the chemical plant. HR directed Dailey to file the complaint in\nwriting, and Dailey did so in October 2010. Dailey stated in the written\ncomplaint that ever since he had complained to Hickner about the co-worker,\nDailey\u2019s supervisor, James Tidwell, and superintendent, Mike Gassen, had\ncreated \u201ca hostile attitude and environment\u201d for Dailey. Dailey complained of\n\u201cHostile Environment; Retaliation; and Discrimination.\u201d Dailey\u2019s complaint\ndid not mention race, did not provide any specific facts, and failed to explain\nhow Gassen or Tidwell were hostile to Dailey.        When HR attempted to\ninvestigate Dailey\u2019s complaint by interviewing him, he refused to provide any\ninformation to HR for the investigation, and HR closed the investigation.\nDailey testified that he refused to participate in the HR investigation because\nhe feared his complaint would be used against him by Tidwell and Gassen.\n      Dailey\u2019s second complaint to HR occurred in 2012, two days before\nDailey\u2019s employment was terminated. The complaint, which did not mention\nrace, regarded an incident where a co-worker threatened to \u201ckick [Dailey\u2019s] a\u2014\ns.\u201d Soon after HR learned of the incident, HR fired the co-worker in compliance\nwith Shintech\u2019s zero-tolerance policy on workplace violence.\n      Dailey also testified that he mentioned in a September 2, 2010 corrective\naction meeting with Hickner, Gassen, and Tidwell that Tidwell had \u201cjokingly\u201d\ncalled Dailey a \u201cblack little motherf\u2014r\u201d on at least two occasions. Dailey\ntestified that Tidwell also told Dailey he would \u201ckick his black a\u2014s,\u201d but did\n\n\n                                      2\n\f    Case: 15-20147     Document: 00513257429     Page: 3   Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                  No. 15-20147\n\nnot specify when Tidwell said that. Another co-worker testified that he had\nheard Tidwell say that to Dailey approximately ten years prior.\n      Dailey testified about one additional incident involving an argument\nbetween Dailey and a female co-worker in March 2011. Dailey testified that\nthe female co-worker called him a \u201cni\u2014er\u201d after discovering that Dailey had\ngiven her on-call shift to another co-worker, which deprived her of overtime\npay. Dailey did not report this comment to HR, and there is no evidence that\nthe co-worker ever directed that term at Dailey again.\n      Dailey was involved in two disciplinary incidents leading up to his\nemployment termination.       The first incident involved Dailey refusing to\ncommunicate with a co-worker because of a disagreement. Dailey was given a\n\u201cCorrective Action Notice\u201d in a September 2, 2010 meeting with Hickner,\nGassen, and Tidwell, for refusing to work with his co-worker and for giving an\ninsubordinate response to Tidwell when Tidwell tried to address the matter\nwith Dailey. The Corrective Action Notice instructed Dailey to communicate\nwith everyone on his shift and warned that failure to improve his behavior and\nwork with other employees would result in further corrective action \u201cup to and\nincluding termination.\u201d\n      The second disciplinary incident involved alleged unruly behavior at fire\nschool in September 2010. At fire school, Shintech employees who work in\nchemical plants learn to fight chemical fires. Participants wear full firefighting\ngear and fight live fires. The supervisor of the safety school contacted Hickner\nto inform her that Dailey had been unruly and unsafe at fire school, had been\ndisrespectful to the supervisor, and would not be permitted to return to fire\nschool unless his behavior improved. According to the supervisor, Dailey had\ngrabbed another participant\u2019s fire hose, which the fire school supervisor\ntestified was unsafe behavior. The supervisor also stated that Dailey had\n\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 15-20147       Document: 00513257429         Page: 4    Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                      No. 15-20147\n\nyelled curse words at other participants because Dailey was upset about\nhaving to wait his turn, and when the fire school supervisor tried to calm\nDailey down by telling Dailey he could go next, Dailey replied, \u201cF\u2014k that. I\nain\u2019t going up there.\u201d According to Dailey, however, the fire school incident\nwas completely made-up because Gassen and Tidwell did not like him.\n       On September 22, 2010, Dailey was given a final Corrective Action\nNotice based on the fire school incident. It was after this disciplinary action\nthat Dailey filed his October 2010 written complaint alleging a hostile work\nenvironment, retaliation, and discrimination.                No discipline or alleged\nharassment occurred between the October 2010 complaint and the third and\nfinal disciplinary incident before Dailey\u2019s termination.\n       The third incident, which occurred on June 29, 2012, involved an\nargument between Dailey and his call partner in which Dailey threatened to\n\u201cmop the floor with him.\u201d The call partner reported the threat to Hickner, and\nHR interviewed Dailey about the incident. After Dailey admitted to making\nthe threat, Shintech fired Dailey in July 2012 for violating Shintech\u2019s zero-\ntolerance policy on workplace violence, as well as for Dailey\u2019s pattern of\nunprofessional behavior, evidenced by his two prior corrective action notices.\n       Dailey appeals the district court\u2019s two summary judgment rulings, which\ngranted summary judgment for Shintech on Dailey\u2019s claims of race\ndiscrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. 1\n\n\n       1  Dailey\u2019s First Amended Complaint asserted four claims against Shintech and a\nShintech employee: (1) intentional racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; (2)\nretaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; (3) discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964; and (4) state-law defamation. The district court dismissed Dailey\u2019s\ndefamation claim, and Dailey does not appeal that ruling.\n        The magistrate judge noted that Dailey did not raise a hostile work environment claim\nin either his First Amended Complaint or his Proposed Pre-Trial Order, but the district court\nconsidered the claim on its merits \u201cbecause Shintech appears to believe Plaintiff has raised\na hostile work environment claim,\u201d and the parties briefed the claim in their filings related\n\n\n                                             4\n\f     Case: 15-20147        Document: 00513257429           Page: 5      Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                         No. 15-20147\n\n                                               II.\n       We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\nRogers v. Bromac Title Servs., LLC, 755 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir. 2014).\nSummary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment\nas a matter of law.\u201d Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A genuine dispute of material\nfact exists \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict\nfor the nonmoving party.\u201d Rogers, 755 F.3d at 350. All facts and inferences\nare construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.\n       Dailey\u2019s claims of racial discrimination and retaliation are asserted\nunder Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. We analyze \u201cracial discrimination and\nretaliation claims based on Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981[] under the same\nrubric of analysis.\u201d Raggs v. Miss. Power & Light Co., 278 F.3d 463, 468 (5th\nCir. 2002); see also Willis v. Cleco Corp., 749 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir. 2014)\n(stating that the \u201clegal framework governing [Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims] is\nco-extensive\u201d).\n                                                A.\n       To establish a claim of employment discrimination based on race without\ndirect evidence of discrimination, 2 Dailey must first make out a prima facie\ncase of discrimination, which requires Dailey to show that he \u201c(1) is a member\n\n\n\nto the motion for summary judgment. See Handzlik v. United States, 93 F. App\u2019x 15, 17 (5th\nCir. 2004) (holding that where both parties \u201csquarely address\u201d a claim in their summary\njudgment briefs, the court may conclude that the parties tried the issue by consent); see also\nAm. Standard Credit, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Cement Co., 643 F.2d 248, 257 n.4 (5th Cir. 1981) (\u201cOn\nappeal, [defendants] argue that neither [plaintiff\u2019s] pleadings nor the pretrial order included\n[the theory plaintiff later asserted]. . . . While this is true, our review of the record convinces\nus that this issue . . . was tried by the consent of parties.\u201d); McDonough Marine Serv., Inc. v.\nM/V Royal St., 608 F.2d 203, 204 (5th Cir. 1979) (\u201cIt is clear that under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(b)\nthe trial court could find implied consent of the parties to the trial of the unpleaded\nissue . . . .\u201d). The parties fully briefed this claim on appeal.\n        2 Dailey does not argue that his claims are based on direct evidence of discrimination.\n\n\n                                                5\n\f    Case: 15-20147       Document: 00513257429       Page: 6    Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                    No. 15-20147\n\nof a protected group; (2) was qualified for the position at issue; (3) was\ndischarged or suffered some adverse employment action by the employer; and\n(4) was replaced by someone outside his protected group or was treated less\nfavorably than other similarly situated employees outside the protected\ngroup.\u201d McCoy v. City of Shreveport, 492 F.3d 551, 556 (5th Cir. 2007). If the\nplaintiff establishes a prima facie case, \u201cthe burden then shifts to the employer\nto produce evidence that its actions were justified by a legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason.\u201d Raggs, 278 F.3d at 468. Finally, if the employer\nproduces such evidence, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff \u201cto show by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory\nexplanation is pretextual.\u201d Id.\n      It is undisputed that Dailey is a member of a protected class, was\nqualified for his position, and was fired. Shintech argues that there is no\nevidence that Dailey was replaced by an individual who was not a member of\nhis protected class, but Dailey testified that he was replaced by a non-African-\nAmerican individual.       Shintech did not rebut this, though Shintech was\ncertainly in a position to do so if it was untrue.\n      Because Dailey established a prima facie case of discrimination, the\nburden    shifted   to   Shintech    to   produce    evidence     of   \u201ca   legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason\u201d for firing Dailey. Raggs, 278 F.3d at 468. Shintech\nmet this burden by producing evidence that Shintech fired Dailey because he\nthreatened to physically harm a co-worker in violation of Shintech\u2019s zero-\ntolerance policy on workplace violence. To prevail, therefore, Dailey\u2019s evidence\nmust create a genuine dispute of material fact regarding pretext. Specifically,\nDailey must show that Shintech\u2019s reason for firing him \u201cis not true,\u201d or that\nShintech\u2019s reason, though true, \u201cis only one of the reasons for its conduct,\u201d with\nanother \u201cmotivating factor\u201d being Dailey\u2019s race.

Because Dailey does not argue that\nShintech\u2019s reason for firing him is not true, Dailey must show that his race was\nanother \u201cmotivating factor\u201d for his employment termination.\n      The district court rejected Dailey\u2019s arguments that race was a motivating\nfactor for his employment termination. First, the district court found that\nDailey was not, as he argued, treated differently than other similarly situated\nindividuals outside of his protected class.      The district court noted that\nShintech had fired Dailey\u2019s co-worker, who was not African-American, soon\nafter Shintech learned that the co-worker had threatened Dailey with physical\nviolence.   Second, the district court rejected Dailey\u2019s argument that his\ndisciplinary incidents were evidence of pretext. The district court pointed out\nthat the fire school incident was confirmed by a third-party fire school trainer\nwho was not associated with Shintech, and Dailey admitted to threatening his\nco-worker. Ultimately, there was no evidence that Shintech did not hold an\nhonest belief in its non-discriminatory reason for terminating Dailey\u2019s\nemployment. See Shackelford v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, 190 F.3d 398, 408\u2013\n09 (5th Cir. 1999). We agree with the district court that Dailey\u2019s evidence does\nnot create a genuine fact issue of pretext on his racial discrimination claim.\n                                       B.\n      Title VII \u201cforbids retaliation by employers against employees who report\nworkplace race or gender discrimination.\u201d         Crawford v. Metro. Gov\u2019t of\nNashville & Davidson Cty., 555 U.S. 271, 273 (2009). To establish a prima\nfacie case of retaliation, Dailey must show that \u201c(1) [h]e engaged in protected\nactivity; (2) an adverse employment action occurred; [and] (3) a causal link\nexists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\u201d\nRoyal v. CCC & R Tres Arboles, LLC, 736 F.3d 396, 400 (5th Cir. 2013). If, as\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 15-20147    Document: 00513257429     Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                 No. 15-20147\n\nhere, no direct evidence of discrimination is produced, a retaliation claim is\nanalyzed under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Id.\n      Shintech concedes that Dailey established the first two requirements of\na retaliation claim, but disputes that there is any causal link between Dailey\u2019s\nOctober 2010 complaint and Dailey\u2019s employment termination in July 2012.\nTo determine causation in this context, the court may consider, among other\nfacts and circumstances of the individual case: (1) the employee\u2019s past\ndisciplinary record; (2) whether the employer followed its typical policy and\nprocedures in terminating the employee; and (3) the temporal proximity of the\nemployee\u2019s protected conduct to the adverse employment action. Nowlin v.\nResolution Trust Corp., 33 F.3d 498, 508 (5th Cir. 1994).        First, Dailey\u2019s\ndisciplinary record shows that Dailey engaged in unprofessional and\ndisrespectful conduct, which resulted in a final warning in September 2010,\nprior to Dailey\u2019s protected activity in October 2010.       Second, Shintech\u2019s\ntermination of Dailey\u2019s employment complied with Shintech\u2019s zero-tolerance\npolicy regarding workplace violence.       This policy was corroborated when\nShintech fired Dailey\u2019s co-worker soon after Shintech found out the co-worker\nhad threatened Dailey with physical harm.\n      Finally, over a year and a half passed between Dailey\u2019s October 2010\ncomplaint and Dailey\u2019s July 2012 employment termination. \u201cClose timing\nbetween an employee\u2019s protected activity and an adverse action against [him]\nmay provide the causal connection required to make out a prima facie case of\nretaliation.\u201d Evans v. City of Hous., 246 F.3d 344, 354 (5th Cir. 2001). A year\nand a half between Dailey\u2019s protected activity and his employment termination\nis not \u201c[c]lose\u201d timing. And Dailey provides no evidence that Shintech was\nnevertheless retaliating against Dailey when Shintech fired him. Compare,\ne.g., Myers v. Crestone Int\u2019l, LLC, 121 F. App\u2019x 25 (5th Cir. 2005) (holding that\n\n\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 15-20147    Document: 00513257429     Page: 9   Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                 No. 15-20147\n\na three-month lapse between the protected conduct and the adverse\nemployment action was not sufficient to establish causation without further\nevidence of pretext), with Shirley v. Chrysler First, Inc., 970 F.2d 39, 44 (5th\nCir. 1992) (holding that causation was established, even though a time lapse\nof fourteen months occurred between the protected conduct and the adverse\nemployment action, because the employee had worked for nine years without\na single complaint until she filed her EEOC charge, after which the employer\n\u201csuddenly found three so-called flagrant indiscretions\u201d and the employer\nmentioned her EEOC complaint to her at least twice a week and \u201charassed\n[her] to death about it\u201d during that time). Unlike the circumstances in Shirley,\nand similar to the circumstances in Myers, Dailey produced no evidence of\nretaliatory behavior by Shintech between Dailey\u2019s final Corrective Action\nNotice in September 2010, which was prior to Dailey\u2019s protected activity, and\nDailey\u2019s employment termination in July 2012. Dailey\u2019s evidence does not\ncreate a genuine fact issue regarding causation and thus cannot support his\nretaliation claim at the summary judgment stage.\n                                      C.\n      To establish a Title VII hostile work environment claim based on race\ndiscrimination, Dailey must show: \u201c(1) [h]e belongs to a protected group; (2)\n[h]e was subjected to unwelcomed harassment; (3) the harassment complained\nof was based on race; (4) the harassment complained of affected a term,\ncondition, or privilege of employment; [and] (5) the employer knew or should\nhave known of the harassment in question and failed to take prompt remedial\naction.\u201d Ramsey v. Henderson, 286 F.3d 264, 268 (5th Cir. 2002). Shintech\nargues that Dailey cannot show that the complained-of harassment affected a\nterm, condition, or privilege of Dailey\u2019s employment.\n\n\n\n\n                                       9\n\f   Case: 15-20147     Document: 00513257429     Page: 10   Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                 No. 15-20147\n\n      The district court rejected Dailey\u2019s argument that his complained-of\nharassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of Dailey\u2019s employment.\nThe district court reasoned that Tidwell\u2019s racial comments toward Dailey did\nnot, alone, create a fact issue, because such evidence does not rise to the level\nof \u201csevere or pervasive\u201d harassment. We agree. \u201c[S]poradic use of abusive\nlanguage\u201d is outside of Title VII\u2019s purview. Faragher v. City of Boca Raton,\n524 U.S. 775, 788 (1998). Accordingly, Dailey\u2019s hostile work environment claim\nalso fails.

Because Dailey\u2019s evidence fails to\nestablish a genuine issue of material fact, we AFFIRM.\n                                             I.\n       Dailey, who is African-American, worked for Shintech at Shintech\u2019s\nFreeport, Texas, chemical plant from 1990 until July 2012 when his\n\n\n       \u2217\n         Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion\nshould not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set\nforth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 15-20147    Document: 00513257429    Page: 2   Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                No. 15-20147\n\nemployment with Shintech was terminated. Dailey argues that several events\nat Shintech between August 2010 and July 2012 constitute employment\ndiscrimination based on race.\n      During that time, Dailey made two complaints to Shintech\u2019s human\nresources department (HR). First, Dailey made an oral complaint to HR in\nAugust 2010 about a co-worker who Dailey alleged was improperly taking\nreadings in the chemical plant. HR directed Dailey to file the complaint in\nwriting, and Dailey did so in October 2010. Dailey stated in the written\ncomplaint that ever since he had complained to Hickner about the co-worker,\nDailey\u2019s supervisor, James Tidwell, and superintendent, Mike Gassen, had\ncreated \u201ca hostile attitude and environment\u201d for Dailey. Dailey complained of\n\u201cHostile Environment; Retaliation; and Discrimination.\u201d Dailey\u2019s complaint\ndid not mention race, did not provide any specific facts, and failed to explain\nhow Gassen or Tidwell were hostile to Dailey.        When HR attempted to\ninvestigate Dailey\u2019s complaint by interviewing him, he refused to provide any\ninformation to HR for the investigation, and HR closed the investigation.\nDailey testified that he refused to participate in the HR investigation because\nhe feared his complaint would be used against him by Tidwell and Gassen.\n      Dailey\u2019s second complaint to HR occurred in 2012, two days before\nDailey\u2019s employment was terminated. The complaint, which did not mention\nrace, regarded an incident where a co-worker threatened to \u201ckick [Dailey\u2019s] a\u2014\ns.\u201d Soon after HR learned of the incident, HR fired the co-worker in compliance\nwith Shintech\u2019s zero-tolerance policy on workplace violence.\n      Dailey also testified that he mentioned in a September 2, 2010 corrective\naction meeting with Hickner, Gassen, and Tidwell that Tidwell had \u201cjokingly\u201d\ncalled Dailey a \u201cblack little motherf\u2014r\u201d on at least two occasions. Dailey\ntestified that Tidwell also told Dailey he would \u201ckick his black a\u2014s,\u201d but did\n\n\n                                      2\n\f    Case: 15-20147     Document: 00513257429     Page: 3   Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                  No. 15-20147\n\nnot specify when Tidwell said that. Another co-worker testified that he had\nheard Tidwell say that to Dailey approximately ten years prior.\n      Dailey testified about one additional incident involving an argument\nbetween Dailey and a female co-worker in March 2011. Dailey testified that\nthe female co-worker called him a \u201cni\u2014er\u201d after discovering that Dailey had\ngiven her on-call shift to another co-worker, which deprived her of overtime\npay. Dailey did not report this comment to HR, and there is no evidence that\nthe co-worker ever directed that term at Dailey again.\n      Dailey was involved in two disciplinary incidents leading up to his\nemployment termination.       The first incident involved Dailey refusing to\ncommunicate with a co-worker because of a disagreement. Dailey was given a\n\u201cCorrective Action Notice\u201d in a September 2, 2010 meeting with Hickner,\nGassen, and Tidwell, for refusing to work with his co-worker and for giving an\ninsubordinate response to Tidwell when Tidwell tried to address the matter\nwith Dailey. The Corrective Action Notice instructed Dailey to communicate\nwith everyone on his shift and warned that failure to improve his behavior and\nwork with other employees would result in further corrective action \u201cup to and\nincluding termination.\u201d\n      The second disciplinary incident involved alleged unruly behavior at fire\nschool in September 2010. At fire school, Shintech employees who work in\nchemical plants learn to fight chemical fires. Participants wear full firefighting\ngear and fight live fires. The supervisor of the safety school contacted Hickner\nto inform her that Dailey had been unruly and unsafe at fire school, had been\ndisrespectful to the supervisor, and would not be permitted to return to fire\nschool unless his behavior improved. According to the supervisor, Dailey had\ngrabbed another participant\u2019s fire hose, which the fire school supervisor\ntestified was unsafe behavior. The supervisor also stated that Dailey had\n\n\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 15-20147       Document: 00513257429         Page: 4    Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                      No. 15-20147\n\nyelled curse words at other participants because Dailey was upset about\nhaving to wait his turn, and when the fire school supervisor tried to calm\nDailey down by telling Dailey he could go next, Dailey replied, \u201cF\u2014k that. I\nain\u2019t going up there.\u201d According to Dailey, however, the fire school incident\nwas completely made-up because Gassen and Tidwell did not like him.\n       On September 22, 2010, Dailey was given a final Corrective Action\nNotice based on the fire school incident. It was after this disciplinary action\nthat Dailey filed his October 2010 written complaint alleging a hostile work\nenvironment, retaliation, and discrimination.                No discipline or alleged\nharassment occurred between the October 2010 complaint and the third and\nfinal disciplinary incident before Dailey\u2019s termination.\n       The third incident, which occurred on June 29, 2012, involved an\nargument between Dailey and his call partner in which Dailey threatened to\n\u201cmop the floor with him.\u201d The call partner reported the threat to Hickner, and\nHR interviewed Dailey about the incident. After Dailey admitted to making\nthe threat, Shintech fired Dailey in July 2012 for violating Shintech\u2019s zero-\ntolerance policy on workplace violence, as well as for Dailey\u2019s pattern of\nunprofessional behavior, evidenced by his two prior corrective action notices.\n       Dailey appeals the district court\u2019s two summary judgment rulings, which\ngranted summary judgment for Shintech on Dailey\u2019s claims of race\ndiscrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment. 1\n\n\n       1  Dailey\u2019s First Amended Complaint asserted four claims against Shintech and a\nShintech employee: (1) intentional racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; (2)\nretaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981; (3) discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964; and (4) state-law defamation. The district court dismissed Dailey\u2019s\ndefamation claim, and Dailey does not appeal that ruling.\n        The magistrate judge noted that Dailey did not raise a hostile work environment claim\nin either his First Amended Complaint or his Proposed Pre-Trial Order, but the district court\nconsidered the claim on its merits \u201cbecause Shintech appears to believe Plaintiff has raised\na hostile work environment claim,\u201d and the parties briefed the claim in their filings related\n\n\n                                             4\n\f     Case: 15-20147        Document: 00513257429           Page: 5      Date Filed: 11/03/2015\n\n\n                                         No. 15-20147\n\n                                               II.\n       We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.\nRogers v.

If the\nplaintiff establishes a prima facie case, \u201cthe burden then shifts to the employer\nto produce evidence that its actions were justified by a legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason.\u201d Raggs, 278 F.3d at 468. Finally, if the employer\nproduces such evidence, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff \u201cto show by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory\nexplanation is pretextual.\u201d Id.\n      It is undisputed that Dailey is a member of a protected class, was\nqualified for his position, and was fired. Shintech argues that there is no\nevidence that Dailey was replaced by an individual who was not a member of\nhis protected class, but Dailey testified that he was replaced by a non-African-\nAmerican individual.       Shintech did not rebut this, though Shintech was\ncertainly in a position to do so if it was untrue.\n      Because Dailey established a prima facie case of discrimination, the\nburden    shifted   to   Shintech    to   produce    evidence     of   \u201ca   legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason\u201d for firing Dailey. Raggs, 278 F.3d at 468. Shintech\nmet this burden by producing evidence that Shintech fired Dailey because he\nthreatened to physically harm a co-worker in violation of Shintech\u2019s zero-\ntolerance policy on workplace violence. To prevail, therefore, Dailey\u2019s evidence\nmust create a genuine dispute of material fact regarding pretext. Specifically,\nDailey must show that Shintech\u2019s reason for firing him \u201cis not true,\u201d or that\nShintech\u2019s reason, though true, \u201cis only one of the reasons for its conduct,\u201d with\nanother \u201cmotivating factor\u201d being Dailey\u2019s race.

Because Dailey does not argue that\nShintech\u2019s reason for firing him is not true, Dailey must show that his race was\nanother \u201cmotivating factor\u201d for his employment termination.\n      The district court rejected Dailey\u2019s arguments that race was a motivating\nfactor for his employment termination. First, the district court found that\nDailey was not, as he argued, treated differently than other similarly situated\nindividuals outside of his protected class.      The district court noted that\nShintech had fired Dailey\u2019s co-worker, who was not African-American, soon\nafter Shintech learned that the co-worker had threatened Dailey with physical\nviolence.   Second, the district court rejected Dailey\u2019s argument that his\ndisciplinary incidents were evidence of pretext. The district court pointed out\nthat the fire school incident was confirmed by a third-party fire school trainer\nwho was not associated with Shintech, and Dailey admitted to threatening his\nco-worker. Ultimately, there was no evidence that Shintech did not hold an\nhonest belief in its non-discriminatory reason for terminating Dailey\u2019s\nemployment. See Shackelford v.

First, Dailey\u2019s\ndisciplinary record shows that Dailey engaged in unprofessional and\ndisrespectful conduct, which resulted in a final warning in September 2010,\nprior to Dailey\u2019s protected activity in October 2010.       Second, Shintech\u2019s\ntermination of Dailey\u2019s employment complied with Shintech\u2019s zero-tolerance\npolicy regarding workplace violence.       This policy was corroborated when\nShintech fired Dailey\u2019s co-worker soon after Shintech found out the co-worker\nhad threatened Dailey with physical harm.\n      Finally, over a year and a half passed between Dailey\u2019s October 2010\ncomplaint and Dailey\u2019s July 2012 employment termination. \u201cClose timing\nbetween an employee\u2019s protected activity and an adverse action against [him]\nmay provide the causal connection required to make out a prima facie case of\nretaliation.\u201d Evans v.

Unlike the circumstances in Shirley,\nand similar to the circumstances in Myers, Dailey produced no evidence of\nretaliatory behavior by Shintech between Dailey\u2019s final Corrective Action\nNotice in September 2010, which was prior to Dailey\u2019s protected activity, and\nDailey\u2019s employment termination in July 2012.
