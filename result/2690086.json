Case Background\n       {\u00b6 2} On February 19, 2008, appellant, CitiMortgage, Inc., filed a\ncomplaint seeking to foreclose on property owned by appellees, James A.\nRoznowksi and Steffanie M. Roznowksi.           In the complaint, CitiMortgage\nspecified that it sought judgment against the Roznowskis for the principal sum\n\n\n       plus interest from August 1, 2007 to October 1, 2007 in the amount\n       of $1,479.90 and interest on said principal at the rate of 7.125%\n       per annum from October 1, 2007, until paid, plus late charges,\n       taxes, assessments and insurance premiums that may be advanced\n       by Plaintiff, and for all costs herein expended; and any and all\n       advancements which have been paid or will be paid for the benefit,\n       preservation and protection of said real property herein.\n\n\nThe complaint further requested that the\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                               January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\n       mortgage may be decreed a valid first and best lien upon said real\n       property, with the exception of taxes and assessments; that its\n       mortgage deed upon the described real property be foreclosed and\n       said real property sold according to the statutes and procedures in\n       effect, free of all claims, liens and interests of all the Defendants,\n       that all named Defendants set forth their claim or interest in said\n       real property or be forever barred from asserting same.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 3} The Roznowskis filed an answer, counterclaim, and third-party\ncomplaint alleging that CitiMortgage and CitiMortgage\u2019s predecessor, ABN\nAMRO Mortgage Group, Inc., had violated the Consumer Sales Practices Act and\nthat Quest Title Agency, Inc. had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law\nwhen it allegedly provided incorrect legal advice to them about documents it had\ndrafted.\n       {\u00b6 4} The trial court granted CitiMortgage\u2019s and Quest\u2019s motions for\nsummary judgment. The entry stated:\n\n\n              It is hereby\n              ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that Plaintiff\u2019s\n       Motion for Summary Judgment and Third-Party Defendant\u2019s\n       Motion for Summary Judgment are GRANTED; and it is further\n              ORDERED that Counsel for Plaintiff is to prepare a\n       judgment entry consistent with this Entry, the pleadings and record\n       within two weeks from the date of this entry. This is a final\n       appealable order and there is no just cause for delay.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {\u00b6 5} The Roznowskis filed an appeal, arguing in their first assignment\nof error that the trial court had entered final judgment without any entry setting\nforth the amount owed. The Fifth District Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal,\nholding that the order was not final and appealable, because it did not set forth the\ndollar amount of the balance due on the mortgage and did not refer to any\ndocuments in the record that did. 5th Dist. Stark No. 2011-CA-124, 2012-Ohio-\n74, at \u00b6 26.\n        {\u00b6 6} On remand, the trial court issued a judgment entry sustaining\nCitiMortgage\u2019s motion for summary judgment and issuing a decree for\nforeclosure. In the entry, the court stated that there was due to CitiMortgage the\nprincipal sum of $126,849.04 on the promissory note, along with interest at\nspecified rates and costs of the action. The court also added to the amounts that\nwere to be recovered\n\n\n        those sums advanced by Plaintiff for costs of evidence of title\n        required to bring this action, for payment of taxes, insurance\n        premiums and expenses incurred for property inspections,\n        appraisal, preservation and maintenance for which amount\n        judgment is awarded in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant[s].\n\n\nThe court further found that the mortgage to CitiMortgage was \u201ca good and valid\nlien and the first and best lien on the real estate * * * prior to all other liens\nagainst same, with the exception of real estate taxes.\u201d The trial court accordingly\nordered the property to be sold by sheriff\u2019s sale.\n        {\u00b6 7} On appeal, the Fifth District dismissed the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction after holding that the trial court had again failed to issue a final,\nappealable order. 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012-CA-93, 2012-Ohio-4901. The court\nof appeals reasoned that \u201cexpenses incurred in property inspections, appraisal,\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                               January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\npreservation and maintenance\u201d as set forth in the trial court\u2019s order are not easily\nascertainable and thus must be set forth specifically before the order is final and\nappealable. Id. at \u00b6 9. It noted that the matter had been pending nearly five years\nand nothing in the record gave the Roznowskis notice of the total amount required\nfor them to exercise their statutory right of redemption. Id. The court also stated\nthat the proper time to challenge these amounts is in the foreclosure action, not\nupon confirmation of a judicial sale. Id.\n       {\u00b6 8} The Fifth District certified that its holding was in conflict with the\nholding of the Seventh District in LaSalle Bank Natl. Assn. v. Smith, 7th Dist.\nMahoning No. 11 MA 85, 2012-Ohio-4040. We determined that a conflict exists\non the following issues:\n\n\n               1. Whether a judgment decree in foreclosure is a final\n       appealable order if it includes as part of the recoverable damages\n       amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals,\n       property protection and maintenance, but does not include specific\n       itemization of those amounts in the judgment.\n               2. Whether a mortgagor that contests amounts expended by\n       a mortgagee for inspections, appraisals, property protection and\n       maintenance can challenge those amounts as part of the\n       proceedings to confirm the foreclosure sale, and appeal any\n       adverse ruling in an appeal of the order of confirmation.\n\n\n134 Ohio St.3d 1447, 2013-Ohio-347, 982 N.E.2d 726.\n                                II. Legal Analysis\n       {\u00b6 9} The issues are interrelated. The first concerns the form of the\njudgment decree in foreclosure, and the second, the timing of appeal by the\nmortgagor of any final damages amounts awarded.\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nA. Specificity of Foreclosure Order\n       {\u00b6 10} Article IV, Section 3(B)(2) of the Ohio Constitution grants\njurisdiction to courts of appeals \u201cto review and affirm, modify, or reverse\njudgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals\nwithin the district.\u201d Consequently, \u201c[i]f an order is not final, then an appellate\ncourt has no jurisdiction.\u201d Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 44 Ohio St.3d\n17, 20, 540 N.E.2d 266 (1989). \u201cAn order of a court is a final appealable order\nonly if the requirements of both R.C. 2505.02 and, if applicable, Civ.R. 54(B), are\nmet.\u201d State ex rel. Scruggs v. Sadler, 97 Ohio St.3d 78, 2002-Ohio-5315, 776\nN.E.2d 101, \u00b6 5.\n       {\u00b6 11} The threshold requirement in our analysis, then, is whether the\njudgment decree in foreclosure that fails to itemize amounts expended for\ninspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance satisfies R.C.\n2505.02. R.C. 2505.02 provides:\n\n\n               (B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed,\n       affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is\n       one of the following:\n               (1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that\n       in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 12} We must accordingly determine whether a decree of foreclosure\nlike the one issued by the trial court in this case meets the requirements set forth\nin R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). The Fifth District and Seventh District have come to\ndifferent conclusions on this issue.\n                          Fifth and Seventh District views\n       {\u00b6 13} In considering whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was final, the\nFifth District noted that generally an order that determines liability but not\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                 January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\ndamages is not a final, appealable order. 2012-Ohio-4901, \u00b6 8, citing Walburn v.\nDunlap, 121 Ohio St.3d 373, 2009-Ohio-1221, 904 N.E.2d 863, \u00b6 31. But it also\nrecognized that an exception to this rule occurs \u201c \u2018where the computation of\ndamages is mechanical and unlikely to produce a second appeal because only a\nministerial task similar to assessing costs remains.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting State ex rel.\nWhite v. Cuyahoga Metro. Housing Auth., 79 Ohio St.3d 543, 546, 684 N.E.2d 72\n(1997). In its decision, the Fifth District reasoned that the expenses incurred for\nproperty inspections, appraisal, preservation, and maintenance \u201care not easily\nascertainable,\u201d \u00b6 9, and accordingly that a judgment that did not specify these\ndamages was not a final, appealable order.\n       {\u00b6 14} The Seventh District reached the opposite conclusion in the\nconflict case, LaSalle Bank Natl. Assn. v. Smith, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 11 MA\n85, 2012-Ohio-4040. In LaSalle, the trial court had granted summary judgment in\nfavor of the mortgagee bank and ordered foreclosure and sale of the property.\nThe mortgagors failed to appeal the order of foreclosure, but after numerous stays\nof the foreclosure sale, they filed a motion for reconsideration and a Civ.R. 60(B)\nmotion for relief from judgment. When the trial court denied both motions, the\nmortgagors appealed, arguing that the original order of foreclosure was not a\nfinal, appealable order, because it failed to determine the amounts due and left\nthat determination for a later date.\n       {\u00b6 15} In the LaSalle order of foreclosure, the trial court had specified the\namount due on the promissory note and the rate of interest. In addition, it stated\nthat the Smiths would be liable for taxes, assessments and penalties on the\nproperty levied by the county treasurer, late charges due under the note and\nmortgage, and sums for taxes, insurance, and property protection advanced by\nLaSalle, but the trial court declined to specify these amounts because they would\nnot be ascertainable until the time of the sale. The trial court added, \u201cPlaintiff has\nand will from time to time advance sums for taxes, insurance and property\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nprotection. Plaintiff has the first and best lien for these amounts in addition to the\namount set forth above. The Court makes no finding as to the amounts of the\nadvances and continues same until the confirmation of sale.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15.\n       {\u00b6 16} Although these amounts were not specified, the Seventh District\nconcluded that a final, appealable order still existed in part because the judgment\nentry detailed the rights of each lienholder. Id. at \u00b6 16. The court held that an\norder of foreclosure that clearly indicates that advances for taxes, insurance, and\nproperty protection are to be determined at confirmation of the sale and that those\nadvances are secured by the first and best lien for those amounts constitutes a\nfinal, appealable order. Id. at \u00b6 21. It further specified, \u201cThis is especially the\ncase when the advances are future costs that have not occurred and potentially\nmay not occur. To find that the judgment entry is nonfinal because it is [sic] does\nnot compute future costs would mean that no judgment of foreclosure and sale\nwould ever be final.\u201d Id.\n       {\u00b6 17} The LaSalle court also distinguished two prior decisions: Second\nNatl. Bank of Warren v. Walling, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 01-C.A.-62, 2002-Ohio-\n3852, and PHH Mtge. Corp. v. Albus, 7th Dist. Monroe No. 09 MO 9, 2011-Ohio-\n3370. In Walling, the Seventh District found that no final, appealable order\nexisted when the trial court\u2019s judgment entry ordered a foreclosure sale but failed\nto resolve \u201cfundamental issues\u201d in the foreclosure case because the entry did not\naddress county, state, and federal tax liens. Walling at \u00b6 19. The LaSalle court\nconcluded that its case was distinguishable from Walling because the rights of all\nlienholders had been determined. LaSalle at \u00b6 16.\n       {\u00b6 18} In PHH, the Seventh District held that the judgment entry could\nnot serve as a final order of foreclosure, because the entry stated that the final\ndecree of foreclosure was \u201cto be submitted\u201d at some point in the future and the\nentry did not include the description and amount of other liens, the priority of the\nliens, and how the funds should be distributed to the various claimants. PHH at\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00b6 18. The LaSalle court\u2019s statement that the amounts advanced by the mortgagee\nwould be determined during confirmation of the sale was not the equivalent of the\nPHH court\u2019s statement that a final decree of foreclosure was to be submitted in\nthe future. LaSalle at \u00b6 19.\n                               No unresolved issues\n       {\u00b6 19} We agree with the analysis of the Seventh District and hold that a\njudgment decree in foreclosure that includes as part of the recoverable damages\namounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals, property\nprotection, and maintenance but does not include specific itemization of those\namounts in the judgment is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C.\n2505.02(B)(1).\n       {\u00b6 20} The Seventh District\u2019s opinion in LaSalle brings to light an\nimportant point: for a judgment decree in foreclosure to constitute a final order, it\nmust address the rights of all lienholders and the responsibilities of the mortgagor.\nAs detailed by the Seventh District, the judgment entries in Walling and PHH\nwere not final orders, because they failed to address the rights of various\nlienholders involved in those cases. In LaSalle and in the present case, however,\nthe judgment entries set forth the rights of all lienholders. Although the trial\ncourts in LaSalle and the present case did not specify the actual amounts due, they\ndid state what the mortgagors would be liable for.         Each party\u2019s rights and\nresponsibilities were fully set forth\u2014all that remained was for the trial court to\nperform the ministerial task of calculating the final amounts that would arise\nduring confirmation proceedings.\n       {\u00b6 21} We acknowledge that the entry in LaSalle indicated that the\nmortgagee \u201chas the first and best lien\u201d for sums advanced for taxes, insurance and\nproperty protection but that the entry here does not specifically say that\nCitiMortgage has the first and best lien for amounts it might advance in this case.\nNevertheless, this does not mean that the entry is not final, because it clearly sets\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nforth the sums for which the Roznowskis are liable. Unlike the judgments in\nWalling and PHH, the trial court has accounted for each party\u2019s interest, and there\nare no remaining determinations for the trial court to make. We accordingly hold\nthat the judgment decree in foreclosure in this case is a final order pursuant to\nR.C. 2505.02(B)(1).\n                              Distinguishable Cases\n       {\u00b6 22} The Roznowskis cite two recent decisions as being consistent with\ntheir argument that the trial court\u2019s judgment does not constitute a final,\nappealable order. In the first case we held: \u201cAn order that declares that an insured\nis entitled to coverage but does not address damages is not a final order as defined\nin R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), because the order does not affect a substantial right even\nthough made in a special proceeding.\u201d Walburn v. Dunlap, 121 Ohio St.3d 373,\n2009-Ohio-1221, 904 N.E.2d 863, at syllabus. In Walburn, a man injured in an\naccident and his wife filed suit against the driver of the other car involved in the\naccident, alleging in part negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Because the\ndriver of the other car was uninsured, the plaintiffs also asserted claims for\nuninsured/underinsured-motorist coverage under policies issued by the insurer of\nthe injured person\u2019s employer. The trial court issued an order declaring that the\ninsurer must provide uninsured/underinsured-motorist coverage but did not\naddress damages. Id. at \u00b6 26. We concluded that because the insurer would be\nobligated to pay only if the insureds were awarded damages in the underlying\nnegligence action, the coverage declaration did not affect a substantial right and\naccordingly did not constitute a final, appealable order. Id. Here, the trial court\u2019s\njudgment forecloses on the mortgage, sets forth the principal sum and interest\naccrued on the note, and lists the categories for future expenses for which the\nRoznowskis will be liable. Unlike the order in Walburn, which left open the\ninitial issue of whether the insurer would be required to pay any damages, all\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f                                 January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\ndamages for which the Roznowskis are responsible are established, and only the\namount is subject to clarification.\n        {\u00b6 23} In the Roznowskis\u2019 second case, the mortgagee voluntarily\ndismissed its action after a default judgment had been entered in its favor, and the\nproperty was sold at a sheriff\u2019s sale. Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P. v.\nNichpor, 136 Ohio St.3d 55, 2013-Ohio-2083, 990 N.E.2d 565. We considered\nwhether a judgment of foreclosure can be dissolved in its entirety before\nconfirmation of sale with a voluntary dismissal filed by a party in accordance with\nCiv.R. 41(A). We held that \u201cafter a judgment entry grants a decree of foreclosure\nand order of sale, the foreclosure action cannot be dismissed pursuant to Civ.R.\n41(A)(1)(a), because that rule pertains only to the voluntary dismissal of a\npending case.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8. We emphasized that a judgment decree in foreclosure\nis a final order and that judicial sales have a certain degree of finality. Id. at \u00b6 6-7.\nOur holding today does not change this proposition.\n        {\u00b6 24} A distinction must be made between the foreclosure decree\u2014\nwhich determines that damages have occurred and sets forth the parties\u2019 rights\nand liabilities as they are related to those damages\u2014and the order confirming the\nproperty sale\u2014which sets forth the specific damage amount and distributes the\nfunds accordingly. A court in a foreclosure suit cannot state with certainty how\nmuch expense a mortgagee might have to advance before a sheriff\u2019s sale has\noccurred and is confirmed, since interest continues to accrue and unforeseen new\ncosts might arise.\n        {\u00b6 25} \u201c \u2018For an order to determine the action and prevent a judgment for\nthe party appealing, it must dispose of the whole merits of the cause or some\nseparate and distinct branch thereof and leave nothing for the determination of the\ntrial court.\u2019 \u201d Natl. City Commercial Capital Corp. v. AAAA At Your Serv., Inc.,\n114 Ohio St.3d 82, 2007-Ohio-2942, 868 N.E.2d 663, \u00b6 7, quoting Hamilton Cty.\nBd. of Mental Retardation & Dev. Disabilities v. Professionals Guild of Ohio, 46\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nOhio St.3d 147, 153, 545 N.E.2d 1260 (1989). Liability is fully and finally\nestablished when the court issues the foreclosure decree and all that remains is\nmathematics, with the court plugging in final amounts due after the property has\nbeen sold at a sheriff\u2019s sale.\n                            The right to redeem property\n        {\u00b6 26} The Roznowskis also argue that if a final, appealable order exists,\ntheir right to redemption of the property would be hampered. We disagree.\n        {\u00b6 27} R.C. 2329.33 establishes the statutory right to redemption in\nforeclosure cases.      That statute provides that \u201cat any time\u201d before the\nconfirmation of the sheriff\u2019s sale,\n\n\n        the debtor may redeem [the property] from sale by depositing in\n        the hands of the clerk of the court of common pleas to which such\n        execution or order is returnable, the amount of the judgment or\n        decree upon which such lands were sold, with all costs, including\n        poundage, and interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum on\n        the purchase money from the day of sale to the time of such\n        deposit, except where the judgment creditor is the purchaser, the\n        interest at such rate on the excess above his claim. The court of\n        common pleas thereupon shall make an order setting aside such\n        sale, and apply the deposit to the payment of such judgment or\n        decree and costs, and award such interest to the purchaser, who\n        shall receive from the officer making the sale the purchase money\n        paid by him, and the interest from the clerk.\n\n\n        {\u00b6 28} \u201cIn Ohio, a mortgagor\u2019s right to redeem is \u2018absolute and may be\nvalidly exercised at any time prior to the confirmation of sale.\u2019 \u201d Hausman v.\nDayton, 73 Ohio St.3d 671, 676, 653 N.E.2d 1190 (1995), quoting Women\u2019s Fed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                     January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\nSav. Bank v. Pappadakes, 38 Ohio St.3d 143, 146, 527 N.E.2d 792 (1988). The\nRoznowskis emphasize the words \u201cprior to the confirmation of sale\u201d and claim\nthat a determination that an order is final without all amounts being set forth\nprevents mortgagors from exercising their right to redemption until after a\nsheriff\u2019s sale has occurred and that it makes mortgagors wholly dependent upon\nthe mortgagee bank to determine the redemption amount.\n        {\u00b6 29} We do not agree that our decision today impairs a mortgagor\u2019s\nright to redemption of the property. Pursuant to R.C. 2329.33, mortgagors still\nmay exercise their right to redeem at any time before the sheriff\u2019s sale is\nconfirmed. While mortgagors may need information regarding certain expenses\nadvanced by the mortgagee, there is no evidence before us that unscrupulous\nmortgagees will willfully withhold that information in an attempt to prevent\nmortgagors from redeeming the property.1                   Furthermore, R.C. 2329.31(A)\nexpressly provides:\n\n\n        Nothing in this section prevents the court of common pleas from\n        staying the confirmation of the sale to permit a property owner\n        time to redeem the property or for any other reason that it\n        determines appropriate.          In those instances, the sale shall be\n        confirmed within thirty days after the termination of any stay of\n        confirmation.\n\n\nThe legislature has accordingly provided mortgagors ample opportunity to\nexercise their right to redemption, and any concerns about a mortgagee\u2019s failure\nto cooperate with providing accounts of costs necessary to determine the\nredemption amount may be brought before the trial court.\n\n1\n  While the Roznowskis state that CitiMortgage has \u201cproven itself unreliable\u201d in disclosing costs,\nthe record does not support this assertion.\n\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 30} We therefore hold that a judgment decree in foreclosure that allows\nas part of recoverable damages unspecified amounts advanced by the mortgagee\nfor inspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance but does not\ninclude specific itemization of those amounts in the judgment is a final,\nappealable order.\nB. Limited Appeal in Confirmation of Foreclosure Proceedings\n       {\u00b6 31} Our holding on the first issue leads to the second: a mortgagor\nmay contest amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals,\nproperty protection, and maintenance during the proceedings to confirm the\nforeclosure sale and may appeal any adverse ruling.\n                           Possibility of limited appeal\n       {\u00b6 32} In its decision, the Fifth District held that the proper time to\nchallenge all amounts is on appeal from the foreclosure action and that because\nconfirmation involves only a determination of whether a sale has been conducted\nin accordance with law, only damages whose computation is mechanical and\nministerial may be addressed during that time. 2012-Ohio-4901, \u00b6 11. However,\nin reaching this conclusion, the court of appeals misapplied two decisions.\n       {\u00b6 33} In determining that the proper time to challenge the existence and\nextent of mortgage liens is in the foreclosure action, rather than upon\nconfirmation of sale, the Fifth District cited Fed. Natl. Mtge. Assn. v. Day, 158\nOhio App.3d 349, 2004-Ohio-4514, 815 N.E.2d 730. (2d Dist.). Day involved an\nappeal by the plaintiff mortgagee challenging the trial court\u2019s sustaining of\nanother mortgagee\u2019s objections to the trial court\u2019s proposed judgment entry\nconfirming a property sale. Specifically, the other mortgagee had claimed during\nthe confirmation proceedings that it held the first lien position on the property\nbecause it had recorded its mortgage before the plaintiff mortgagee. Id. at \u00b6 7.\nThe Second District properly held that the bank was not permitted to raise this\nobjection during the confirmation proceedings, because the proper time to\n\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\f                               January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\nchallenge lien priority is on appeal from the foreclosure order. Id. at \u00b6 15. Day\nthus does not support the Fifth District\u2019s conclusion that the amount of damages\ncannot be challenged on appeal after the confirmation proceedings.\n       {\u00b6 34} The Fifth District also mistakenly relied upon Ohio Sav. Bank v.\nAmbrose, 56 Ohio St.3d 53, 563 N.E.2d 1388 (1990), for its assertion that\n\u201c[c]onfirmation involves only a determination of whether a sale has been\nconducted in accord with law, such as whether the public notice requirements\nwere followed and whether the sale price was at least two-thirds of lands [sic]\nappraised value.\u201d 2012-Ohio-4901 at \u00b6 11, citing Ohio Sav. Bank at 55. Ohio\nSav. Bank involved an attempt by the purchaser at a sheriff\u2019s sale to appeal the\ntrial court\u2019s order denying confirmation of the sheriff\u2019s sale after the mortgagor\nredeemed the property. We held that because purchasers at foreclosure have no\nvested interest in the property before confirmation of sale, they have no standing\nto appeal if the trial court denies confirmation. Id. at 55. We did not limit what a\ntrial court may consider when determining whether to exercise its discretion to\ngrant or deny confirmation. In stating that before granting confirmation, the trial\ncourt must be \u201csatisfied of the legality of such sale\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2329.31, we\ndid not preclude mortgagors from challenging on appeal damages determined\nduring confirmation proceedings.\n       {\u00b6 35} We agree with the Seventh District in LaSalle that two judgments\nare appealable in foreclosure actions: the order of foreclosure and sale and the\norder of confirmation of sale. LaSalle Bank Natl. Assn., 2012-Ohio-4040, \u00b6 20.\nA mortgagor that contests amounts expended by a mortgagee for inspections,\nappraisals, property protection, and maintenance may challenge those amounts as\npart of the proceedings to confirm the foreclosure sale and may appeal the order\nof confirmation.\n       {\u00b6 36} R.C. 2329.31(A) provides:\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       Upon the return of any writ of execution for the satisfaction of\n       which lands and tenements have been sold, on careful examination\n       of the proceedings of the officer making the sale, if the court of\n       common pleas finds that the sale was made, in all respects, in\n       conformity with sections 2329.01 to 2329.61 of the Revised Code,\n       it shall, within thirty days of the return of the writ, direct the clerk\n       of the court of common pleas to make an entry on the journal that\n       the court is satisfied of the legality of such sale and that the\n       attorney who filed the writ of execution make to the purchaser a\n       deed for the lands and tenements.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) The statute thus requires the court to carefully examine the\nproceedings to determine the legality of the sale in all respects. As part of this\nexamination, the court must determine whether the amounts advanced for\ninspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance are accurate.\nNaturally, the mortgagor must have an opportunity to challenge these amounts\nand raise the issue on appeal if the mortgagor believes that the amounts the trial\ncourt determines are incorrect.\n                            No conflict with prior cases\n       {\u00b6 37} The Roznowskis argue that we have previously determined that no\nappeal may be taken from a confirmation sale in Oberlin Sav. Bank Co. v.\nFairchild, 175 Ohio St. 311, 194 N.E.2d 580 (1963). We disagree. In Fairchild,\nthe bank brought an action to foreclose on a mortgage and named as a defendant\nCarmen Fairchild, who claimed a life estate in the property. Fairchild failed to\nfile an answer or otherwise appear before issuance of the order of foreclosure. At\nthe confirmation hearing, Fairchild entered an appearance, seeking a share in the\nexcess proceeds from the sale. The trial court denied her claim and confirmed the\nsale. She initially prevailed on appeal, but we reversed the holding of the court of\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f                                January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\nappeals.   We held that Fairchild should have appealed from the order of\nforeclosure, in which the court set forth the amounts due to the various claimants\nto the property. Furthermore, we stated that the court of appeals erred when it\nreversed the trial court\u2019s decision because she had never filed a pleading in the\ncase and presented no evidence in support of her claim.\n       {\u00b6 38} Our decision today is consistent with Fairchild. The order of\nforeclosure is a final, appealable order that sets forth the duties and liabilities of\nthose who have an interest in the property. Accordingly, if an individual or entity\nbelieves that the order of foreclosure fails to accurately reflect an interest in the\nproperty, the proper means to challenge the court\u2019s determination is by appealing\nthe order of foreclosure. Because Fairchild failed to appear in the case, she\nforfeited the right to assert her interest once the sale of the property had occurred.\nUnlike Fairchild, the Roznowskis participated in the case and had their\nresponsibilities and interest set forth in the foreclosure decree.        They have\nstanding to appeal the confirmation of the sale.\n       {\u00b6 39} There are thus two judgments appealable in foreclosure actions:\nthe order of foreclosure and the confirmation of sale. The order of foreclosure\ndetermines the extent of each lienholder\u2019s interest, sets forth the priority of the\nliens, and determines the other rights and responsibilities of each party in the\naction. On appeal from the order of foreclosure, the parties may challenge the\ncourt\u2019s decision to grant the decree of foreclosure. Once the order of foreclosure\nis final and the appeals process has been completed, all rights and responsibilities\nof the parties have been determined and can no longer be challenged.\n       {\u00b6 40} The confirmation process is an ancillary one in which the issues\npresent are limited to whether the sale proceedings conformed to law. Because of\nthis limited nature of the confirmation proceedings, the parties have a limited\nright to appeal the confirmation. For example, on appeal of the order confirming\nthe sale, the parties may challenge the confirmation of the sale itself, including\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ncomputation of the final total owed by the mortgagor, accrued interest, and actual\namounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals, property\nprotection, and maintenance. The issues appealed from confirmation are wholly\ndistinct from the issues appealed from the order of foreclosure. In other words, if\nthe parties appeal the confirmation proceedings, they do not get a second bite of\nthe apple, but a first bite of a different fruit.\n                               No disadvantage to parties\n        {\u00b6 41} The Roznowskis contend that allowing appeal of confirmation\nproceedings harms mortgagors who wish to redeem their property because they\nmay dispute only the amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections,\nappraisals, property protection, and maintenance at the confirmation of sale.\nHowever, as discussed above, R.C. 2329.31(A) provides that mortgagors may\nseek to stay the confirmation of the sale and determine the exact amount needed\nto redeem the property during this time.\n        {\u00b6 42} The Roznowskis also claim that allowing an appeal of\nconfirmation proceedings disadvantages prospective purchasers, for they can\n\u201conly buy a property that was subject to subsequent determination of whether the\njudgment ordering sale was calculated correctly.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) They also\nargue that it disadvantages foreclosing mortgagees because they will see a drop in\nsales prices or have to pay back the sale price under R.C. 2329.45 in the event of a\nreversal.    We disagree.       The finality of confirmation proceedings remains\nunaffected. R.C. 2329.45 does not state that a sale will be invalidated if a\nmortgagor successfully challenges the amounts the mortgagee has stated that it\nhas advanced for inspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance.\nInstead, the statute provides, \u201cIf a judgment in satisfaction of which lands, or\ntenements are sold, is reversed, such reversal shall not defeat or affect the title of\nthe purchaser.\u201d      (Emphasis added.)        R.C. 2329.45.   Furthermore, allowing\nmortgagors to appeal these amounts does not give those mortgagors a chance to\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f                                   January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\nundo the foreclosure judgment\u2014it merely allows them to challenge the accuracy\nof those amounts in determining the total amount owed by them to the mortgagee.\n                                     III. Conclusion\n          {\u00b6 43} We answer the two certified-conflict issues in the affirmative. A\njudgment decree in foreclosure that allows as part of recoverable damages\nunspecified amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals,\nproperty protection, and maintenance is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C.\n2505.02(B)(1). A mortgagor may contest amounts expended by a mortgagee for\ninspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance during proceedings\nto confirm the foreclosure sale and may appeal the order of confirmation of sale.\n          {\u00b6 44} We accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of appeals that\nthe trial court failed to issue a final, appealable order, and we remand the case to\nthe court of appeals so that it may consider the Roznowskis\u2019 remaining\nassignments of error.\n                                                                  Judgment reversed\n                                                                and cause remanded.\n          O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., and PFEIFER, O\u2019DONNELL, KENNEDY, and FRENCH, JJ.,\nconcur.\n          O\u2019NEILL, J., dissents.\n                               _____________________\n          O\u2019NEILL, J., dissenting.\n          {\u00b6 45} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s ruling on the first issue\npresented in this case. I would hold that a judgment decree in foreclosure that\nallows as part of recoverable damages, to be determined later by a formula,\nunspecified amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals,\nproperty protection, and maintenance is a final, appealable order. I agree with the\nmajority\u2019s assertion that \u201c[l]iability is fully and finally established when the court\nissues the foreclosure decree and all that remains is mathematics, with the court\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nplugging in final amounts due after the property has been sold at a sheriff\u2019s sale.\u201d\nMajority opinion, \u00b6 25. However, I do not think that merely listing the categories\nof the unspecified amounts is sufficient to fully and finally establish liability. The\npossible interference with a mortgagor\u2019s right of redemption in these cases does\nnot necessarily arise from unscrupulous mortgagees willfully withholding the\namount of these unspecified expenses. The violation of due process comes from\nthe method of verifying the reasonableness of those expenses.               I share the\nobservation of the Fifth District Court of Appeals in this case that the dollar\namount of expenses incurred in property inspections, appraisal, preservation, and\nmaintenance is not easily ascertainable. 2012-Ohio-4901, \u00b6 9. Even if the final\nnumber is not available at the time of the order of foreclosure, mortgagees should\nbe made to show how they will arrive at this final number.                  An order is\nconclusively final and appealable \u201c \u2018where the computation of damages is\nmechanical and unlikely to produce a second appeal because only a ministerial\ntask similar to assessing costs remains.\u2019 \u201d Majority opinion, \u00b6 13, quoting State\nex rel. White v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth., 79 Ohio St.3d 543, 546, 684\nN.E.2d 72 (1997). Anything less than this degree of specificity undermines the\nfinality of an order of foreclosure and invites error. I concur with the majority\nopinion as to the second issue; however, I dissent as to the first issue.\n        {\u00b6 46} In conclusion, I believe that an order is final and appealable only if\nall that remains is ministerial mathematical calculations arrived at by a method\nthat has been approved by the trial court in the order of foreclosure. In short, no\nadd-ons or surprises.     Anything less is a moving target, which will clearly\nundermine the finality of the order and lead to more, not less, confusion and\nlitigation.\n                              ____________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                                 January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\n       Carpenter, Lipps & Leland, L.L.P., David A.

Case Background\n       {\u00b6 2} On February 19, 2008, appellant, CitiMortgage, Inc., filed a\ncomplaint seeking to foreclose on property owned by appellees, James A.\nRoznowksi and Steffanie M. Roznowksi.           In the complaint, CitiMortgage\nspecified that it sought judgment against the Roznowskis for the principal sum\n\n\n       plus interest from August 1, 2007 to October 1, 2007 in the amount\n       of $1,479.90 and interest on said principal at the rate of 7.125%\n       per annum from October 1, 2007, until paid, plus late charges,\n       taxes, assessments and insurance premiums that may be advanced\n       by Plaintiff, and for all costs herein expended; and any and all\n       advancements which have been paid or will be paid for the benefit,\n       preservation and protection of said real property herein.\n\n\nThe complaint further requested that the\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                               January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\n       mortgage may be decreed a valid first and best lien upon said real\n       property, with the exception of taxes and assessments; that its\n       mortgage deed upon the described real property be foreclosed and\n       said real property sold according to the statutes and procedures in\n       effect, free of all claims, liens and interests of all the Defendants,\n       that all named Defendants set forth their claim or interest in said\n       real property or be forever barred from asserting same.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 3} The Roznowskis filed an answer, counterclaim, and third-party\ncomplaint alleging that CitiMortgage and CitiMortgage\u2019s predecessor, ABN\nAMRO Mortgage Group, Inc., had violated the Consumer Sales Practices Act and\nthat Quest Title Agency, Inc. had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law\nwhen it allegedly provided incorrect legal advice to them about documents it had\ndrafted.\n       {\u00b6 4} The trial court granted CitiMortgage\u2019s and Quest\u2019s motions for\nsummary judgment. The entry stated:\n\n\n              It is hereby\n              ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED that Plaintiff\u2019s\n       Motion for Summary Judgment and Third-Party Defendant\u2019s\n       Motion for Summary Judgment are GRANTED; and it is further\n              ORDERED that Counsel for Plaintiff is to prepare a\n       judgment entry consistent with this Entry, the pleadings and record\n       within two weeks from the date of this entry. This is a final\n       appealable order and there is no just cause for delay.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n        {\u00b6 5} The Roznowskis filed an appeal, arguing in their first assignment\nof error that the trial court had entered final judgment without any entry setting\nforth the amount owed. The Fifth District Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal,\nholding that the order was not final and appealable, because it did not set forth the\ndollar amount of the balance due on the mortgage and did not refer to any\ndocuments in the record that did. 5th Dist. Stark No. 2011-CA-124, 2012-Ohio-\n74, at \u00b6 26.\n        {\u00b6 6} On remand, the trial court issued a judgment entry sustaining\nCitiMortgage\u2019s motion for summary judgment and issuing a decree for\nforeclosure. In the entry, the court stated that there was due to CitiMortgage the\nprincipal sum of $126,849.04 on the promissory note, along with interest at\nspecified rates and costs of the action. The court also added to the amounts that\nwere to be recovered\n\n\n        those sums advanced by Plaintiff for costs of evidence of title\n        required to bring this action, for payment of taxes, insurance\n        premiums and expenses incurred for property inspections,\n        appraisal, preservation and maintenance for which amount\n        judgment is awarded in favor of Plaintiff and against Defendant[s].\n\n\nThe court further found that the mortgage to CitiMortgage was \u201ca good and valid\nlien and the first and best lien on the real estate * * * prior to all other liens\nagainst same, with the exception of real estate taxes.\u201d The trial court accordingly\nordered the property to be sold by sheriff\u2019s sale.\n        {\u00b6 7} On appeal, the Fifth District dismissed the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction after holding that the trial court had again failed to issue a final,\nappealable order. 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012-CA-93, 2012-Ohio-4901. The court\nof appeals reasoned that \u201cexpenses incurred in property inspections, appraisal,\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                               January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\npreservation and maintenance\u201d as set forth in the trial court\u2019s order are not easily\nascertainable and thus must be set forth specifically before the order is final and\nappealable. Id. at \u00b6 9. It noted that the matter had been pending nearly five years\nand nothing in the record gave the Roznowskis notice of the total amount required\nfor them to exercise their statutory right of redemption. Id. The court also stated\nthat the proper time to challenge these amounts is in the foreclosure action, not\nupon confirmation of a judicial sale. Id.\n       {\u00b6 8} The Fifth District certified that its holding was in conflict with the\nholding of the Seventh District in LaSalle Bank Natl. Assn. v. Smith, 7th Dist.\nMahoning No. 11 MA 85, 2012-Ohio-4040. We determined that a conflict exists\non the following issues:\n\n\n               1. Whether a judgment decree in foreclosure is a final\n       appealable order if it includes as part of the recoverable damages\n       amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals,\n       property protection and maintenance, but does not include specific\n       itemization of those amounts in the judgment.\n               2. Whether a mortgagor that contests amounts expended by\n       a mortgagee for inspections, appraisals, property protection and\n       maintenance can challenge those amounts as part of the\n       proceedings to confirm the foreclosure sale, and appeal any\n       adverse ruling in an appeal of the order of confirmation.\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2013-Ohio-347, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">982</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n                                II. Legal Analysis\n       {\u00b6 9} The issues are interrelated. The first concerns the form of the\njudgment decree in foreclosure, and the second, the timing of appeal by the\nmortgagor of any final damages amounts awarded.\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nA.

R.C. 2505.02 provides:\n\n\n               (B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed,\n       affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is\n       one of the following:\n               (1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that\n       in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\n\n\n       {\u00b6 12} We must accordingly determine whether a decree of foreclosure\nlike the one issued by the trial court in this case meets the requirements set forth\nin R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). The Fifth District and Seventh District have come to\ndifferent conclusions on this issue.\n                          Fifth and Seventh District views\n       {\u00b6 13} In considering whether the trial court\u2019s judgment was final, the\nFifth District noted that generally an order that determines liability but not\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                 January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\ndamages is not a final, appealable order. 2012-Ohio-4901, \u00b6 8, citing Walburn v.\nDunlap, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2009-Ohio-1221, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 31.

In its decision, the Fifth District reasoned that the expenses incurred for\nproperty inspections, appraisal, preservation, and maintenance \u201care not easily\nascertainable,\u201d \u00b6 9, and accordingly that a judgment that did not specify these\ndamages was not a final, appealable order.\n       {\u00b6 14} The Seventh District reached the opposite conclusion in the\nconflict case, LaSalle Bank Natl. Assn. v. Smith, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 11 MA\n85, 2012-Ohio-4040. In LaSalle, the trial court had granted summary judgment in\nfavor of the mortgagee bank and ordered foreclosure and sale of the property.\nThe mortgagors failed to appeal the order of foreclosure, but after numerous stays\nof the foreclosure sale, they filed a motion for reconsideration and a Civ.R. 60(B)\nmotion for relief from judgment. When the trial court denied both motions, the\nmortgagors appealed, arguing that the original order of foreclosure was not a\nfinal, appealable order, because it failed to determine the amounts due and left\nthat determination for a later date.\n       {\u00b6 15} In the LaSalle order of foreclosure, the trial court had specified the\namount due on the promissory note and the rate of interest. In addition, it stated\nthat the Smiths would be liable for taxes, assessments and penalties on the\nproperty levied by the county treasurer, late charges due under the note and\nmortgage, and sums for taxes, insurance, and property protection advanced by\nLaSalle, but the trial court declined to specify these amounts because they would\nnot be ascertainable until the time of the sale. The trial court added, \u201cPlaintiff has\nand will from time to time advance sums for taxes, insurance and property\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nprotection. Plaintiff has the first and best lien for these amounts in addition to the\namount set forth above. The Court makes no finding as to the amounts of the\nadvances and continues same until the confirmation of sale.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15.\n       {\u00b6 16} Although these amounts were not specified, the Seventh District\nconcluded that a final, appealable order still existed in part because the judgment\nentry detailed the rights of each lienholder. Id. at \u00b6 16. The court held that an\norder of foreclosure that clearly indicates that advances for taxes, insurance, and\nproperty protection are to be determined at confirmation of the sale and that those\nadvances are secured by the first and best lien for those amounts constitutes a\nfinal, appealable order. Id. at \u00b6 21. It further specified, \u201cThis is especially the\ncase when the advances are future costs that have not occurred and potentially\nmay not occur. To find that the judgment entry is nonfinal because it is [sic] does\nnot compute future costs would mean that no judgment of foreclosure and sale\nwould ever be final.\u201d Id.\n       {\u00b6 17} The LaSalle court also distinguished two prior decisions: Second\nNatl. Bank of Warren v. Walling, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 01-C.A.-62, 2002-Ohio-\n3852, and PHH Mtge. Corp. v. Albus, 7th Dist. Monroe No. 09 MO 9, 2011-Ohio-\n3370. In Walling, the Seventh District found that no final, appealable order\nexisted when the trial court\u2019s judgment entry ordered a foreclosure sale but failed\nto resolve \u201cfundamental issues\u201d in the foreclosure case because the entry did not\naddress county, state, and federal tax liens. Walling at \u00b6 19. The LaSalle court\nconcluded that its case was distinguishable from Walling because the rights of all\nlienholders had been determined. LaSalle at \u00b6 16.\n       {\u00b6 18} In PHH, the Seventh District held that the judgment entry could\nnot serve as a final order of foreclosure, because the entry stated that the final\ndecree of foreclosure was \u201cto be submitted\u201d at some point in the future and the\nentry did not include the description and amount of other liens, the priority of the\nliens, and how the funds should be distributed to the various claimants.

The LaSalle court\u2019s statement that the amounts advanced by the mortgagee\nwould be determined during confirmation of the sale was not the equivalent of the\nPHH court\u2019s statement that a final decree of foreclosure was to be submitted in\nthe future. LaSalle at \u00b6 19.\n                               No unresolved issues\n       {\u00b6 19} We agree with the analysis of the Seventh District and hold that a\njudgment decree in foreclosure that includes as part of the recoverable damages\namounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals, property\nprotection, and maintenance but does not include specific itemization of those\namounts in the judgment is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C.\n2505.02(B)(1).\n       {\u00b6 20} The Seventh District\u2019s opinion in LaSalle brings to light an\nimportant point: for a judgment decree in foreclosure to constitute a final order, it\nmust address the rights of all lienholders and the responsibilities of the mortgagor.\nAs detailed by the Seventh District, the judgment entries in Walling and PHH\nwere not final orders, because they failed to address the rights of various\nlienholders involved in those cases. In LaSalle and in the present case, however,\nthe judgment entries set forth the rights of all lienholders. Although the trial\ncourts in LaSalle and the present case did not specify the actual amounts due, they\ndid state what the mortgagors would be liable for.         Each party\u2019s rights and\nresponsibilities were fully set forth\u2014all that remained was for the trial court to\nperform the ministerial task of calculating the final amounts that would arise\nduring confirmation proceedings.\n       {\u00b6 21} We acknowledge that the entry in LaSalle indicated that the\nmortgagee \u201chas the first and best lien\u201d for sums advanced for taxes, insurance and\nproperty protection but that the entry here does not specifically say that\nCitiMortgage has the first and best lien for amounts it might advance in this case.\nNevertheless, this does not mean that the entry is not final, because it clearly sets\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nforth the sums for which the Roznowskis are liable. Unlike the judgments in\nWalling and PHH, the trial court has accounted for each party\u2019s interest, and there\nare no remaining determinations for the trial court to make. We accordingly hold\nthat the judgment decree in foreclosure in this case is a final order pursuant to\nR.C. 2505.02(B)(1).\n                              Distinguishable Cases\n       {\u00b6 22} The Roznowskis cite two recent decisions as being consistent with\ntheir argument that the trial court\u2019s judgment does not constitute a final,\nappealable order. In the first case we held: \u201cAn order that declares that an insured\nis entitled to coverage but does not address damages is not a final order as defined\nin R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), because the order does not affect a substantial right even\nthough made in a special proceeding.\u201d Walburn v.

In Walburn, a man injured in an\naccident and his wife filed suit against the driver of the other car involved in the\naccident, alleging in part negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Because the\ndriver of the other car was uninsured, the plaintiffs also asserted claims for\nuninsured/underinsured-motorist coverage under policies issued by the insurer of\nthe injured person\u2019s employer. The trial court issued an order declaring that the\ninsurer must provide uninsured/underinsured-motorist coverage but did not\naddress damages. Id. at \u00b6 26. We concluded that because the insurer would be\nobligated to pay only if the insureds were awarded damages in the underlying\nnegligence action, the coverage declaration did not affect a substantial right and\naccordingly did not constitute a final, appealable order. Id. Here, the trial court\u2019s\njudgment forecloses on the mortgage, sets forth the principal sum and interest\naccrued on the note, and lists the categories for future expenses for which the\nRoznowskis will be liable.

We considered\nwhether a judgment of foreclosure can be dissolved in its entirety before\nconfirmation of sale with a voluntary dismissal filed by a party in accordance with\nCiv.R. 41(A).

That statute provides that \u201cat any time\u201d before the\nconfirmation of the sheriff\u2019s sale,\n\n\n        the debtor may redeem [the property] from sale by depositing in\n        the hands of the clerk of the court of common pleas to which such\n        execution or order is returnable, the amount of the judgment or\n        decree upon which such lands were sold, with all costs, including\n        poundage, and interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum on\n        the purchase money from the day of sale to the time of such\n        deposit, except where the judgment creditor is the purchaser, the\n        interest at such rate on the excess above his claim.

The\nRoznowskis emphasize the words \u201cprior to the confirmation of sale\u201d and claim\nthat a determination that an order is final without all amounts being set forth\nprevents mortgagors from exercising their right to redemption until after a\nsheriff\u2019s sale has occurred and that it makes mortgagors wholly dependent upon\nthe mortgagee bank to determine the redemption amount.\n        {\u00b6 29} We do not agree that our decision today impairs a mortgagor\u2019s\nright to redemption of the property. Pursuant to R.C. 2329.33, mortgagors still\nmay exercise their right to redeem at any time before the sheriff\u2019s sale is\nconfirmed. While mortgagors may need information regarding certain expenses\nadvanced by the mortgagee, there is no evidence before us that unscrupulous\nmortgagees will willfully withhold that information in an attempt to prevent\nmortgagors from redeeming the property.1                   Furthermore, R.C. 2329.31(A)\nexpressly provides:\n\n\n        Nothing in this section prevents the court of common pleas from\n        staying the confirmation of the sale to permit a property owner\n        time to redeem the property or for any other reason that it\n        determines appropriate.          In those instances, the sale shall be\n        confirmed within thirty days after the termination of any stay of\n        confirmation.\n\n\nThe legislature has accordingly provided mortgagors ample opportunity to\nexercise their right to redemption, and any concerns about a mortgagee\u2019s failure\nto cooperate with providing accounts of costs necessary to determine the\nredemption amount may be brought before the trial court.\n\n1\n  While the Roznowskis state that CitiMortgage has \u201cproven itself unreliable\u201d in disclosing costs,\nthe record does not support this assertion.\n\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 30} We therefore hold that a judgment decree in foreclosure that allows\nas part of recoverable damages unspecified amounts advanced by the mortgagee\nfor inspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance but does not\ninclude specific itemization of those amounts in the judgment is a final,\nappealable order.\nB. Limited Appeal in Confirmation of Foreclosure Proceedings\n       {\u00b6 31} Our holding on the first issue leads to the second: a mortgagor\nmay contest amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals,\nproperty protection, and maintenance during the proceedings to confirm the\nforeclosure sale and may appeal any adverse ruling.\n                           Possibility of limited appeal\n       {\u00b6 32} In its decision, the Fifth District held that the proper time to\nchallenge all amounts is on appeal from the foreclosure action and that because\nconfirmation involves only a determination of whether a sale has been conducted\nin accordance with law, only damages whose computation is mechanical and\nministerial may be addressed during that time. 2012-Ohio-4901, \u00b6 11.

In stating that before granting confirmation, the trial\ncourt must be \u201csatisfied of the legality of such sale\u201d pursuant to R.C. 2329.31, we\ndid not preclude mortgagors from challenging on appeal damages determined\nduring confirmation proceedings.\n       {\u00b6 35} We agree with the Seventh District in LaSalle that two judgments\nare appealable in foreclosure actions: the order of foreclosure and sale and the\norder of confirmation of sale. LaSalle Bank Natl. Assn., 2012-Ohio-4040, \u00b6 20.\nA mortgagor that contests amounts expended by a mortgagee for inspections,\nappraisals, property protection, and maintenance may challenge those amounts as\npart of the proceedings to confirm the foreclosure sale and may appeal the order\nof confirmation.\n       {\u00b6 36} R.C. 2329.31(A) provides:\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       Upon the return of any writ of execution for the satisfaction of\n       which lands and tenements have been sold, on careful examination\n       of the proceedings of the officer making the sale, if the court of\n       common pleas finds that the sale was made, in all respects, in\n       conformity with sections 2329.01 to 2329.61 of the Revised Code,\n       it shall, within thirty days of the return of the writ, direct the clerk\n       of the court of common pleas to make an entry on the journal that\n       the court is satisfied of the legality of such sale and that the\n       attorney who filed the writ of execution make to the purchaser a\n       deed for the lands and tenements.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) The statute thus requires the court to carefully examine the\nproceedings to determine the legality of the sale in all respects. As part of this\nexamination, the court must determine whether the amounts advanced for\ninspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance are accurate.\nNaturally, the mortgagor must have an opportunity to challenge these amounts\nand raise the issue on appeal if the mortgagor believes that the amounts the trial\ncourt determines are incorrect.\n                            No conflict with prior cases\n       {\u00b6 37} The Roznowskis argue that we have previously determined that no\nappeal may be taken from a confirmation sale in Oberlin Sav.

We disagree. In Fairchild,\nthe bank brought an action to foreclose on a mortgage and named as a defendant\nCarmen Fairchild, who claimed a life estate in the property. Fairchild failed to\nfile an answer or otherwise appear before issuance of the order of foreclosure. At\nthe confirmation hearing, Fairchild entered an appearance, seeking a share in the\nexcess proceeds from the sale. The trial court denied her claim and confirmed the\nsale. She initially prevailed on appeal, but we reversed the holding of the court of\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f                                January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\nappeals.   We held that Fairchild should have appealed from the order of\nforeclosure, in which the court set forth the amounts due to the various claimants\nto the property. Furthermore, we stated that the court of appeals erred when it\nreversed the trial court\u2019s decision because she had never filed a pleading in the\ncase and presented no evidence in support of her claim.\n       {\u00b6 38} Our decision today is consistent with Fairchild. The order of\nforeclosure is a final, appealable order that sets forth the duties and liabilities of\nthose who have an interest in the property. Accordingly, if an individual or entity\nbelieves that the order of foreclosure fails to accurately reflect an interest in the\nproperty, the proper means to challenge the court\u2019s determination is by appealing\nthe order of foreclosure. Because Fairchild failed to appear in the case, she\nforfeited the right to assert her interest once the sale of the property had occurred.\nUnlike Fairchild, the Roznowskis participated in the case and had their\nresponsibilities and interest set forth in the foreclosure decree.        They have\nstanding to appeal the confirmation of the sale.\n       {\u00b6 39} There are thus two judgments appealable in foreclosure actions:\nthe order of foreclosure and the confirmation of sale. The order of foreclosure\ndetermines the extent of each lienholder\u2019s interest, sets forth the priority of the\nliens, and determines the other rights and responsibilities of each party in the\naction. On appeal from the order of foreclosure, the parties may challenge the\ncourt\u2019s decision to grant the decree of foreclosure. Once the order of foreclosure\nis final and the appeals process has been completed, all rights and responsibilities\nof the parties have been determined and can no longer be challenged.\n       {\u00b6 40} The confirmation process is an ancillary one in which the issues\npresent are limited to whether the sale proceedings conformed to law. Because of\nthis limited nature of the confirmation proceedings, the parties have a limited\nright to appeal the confirmation. For example, on appeal of the order confirming\nthe sale, the parties may challenge the confirmation of the sale itself, including\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f                               SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\ncomputation of the final total owed by the mortgagor, accrued interest, and actual\namounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals, property\nprotection, and maintenance. The issues appealed from confirmation are wholly\ndistinct from the issues appealed from the order of foreclosure. In other words, if\nthe parties appeal the confirmation proceedings, they do not get a second bite of\nthe apple, but a first bite of a different fruit.\n                               No disadvantage to parties\n        {\u00b6 41} The Roznowskis contend that allowing appeal of confirmation\nproceedings harms mortgagors who wish to redeem their property because they\nmay dispute only the amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections,\nappraisals, property protection, and maintenance at the confirmation of sale.\nHowever, as discussed above, R.C. 2329.31(A) provides that mortgagors may\nseek to stay the confirmation of the sale and determine the exact amount needed\nto redeem the property during this time.\n        {\u00b6 42} The Roznowskis also claim that allowing an appeal of\nconfirmation proceedings disadvantages prospective purchasers, for they can\n\u201conly buy a property that was subject to subsequent determination of whether the\njudgment ordering sale was calculated correctly.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) They also\nargue that it disadvantages foreclosing mortgagees because they will see a drop in\nsales prices or have to pay back the sale price under R.C. 2329.45 in the event of a\nreversal.    We disagree.       The finality of confirmation proceedings remains\nunaffected. R.C. 2329.45 does not state that a sale will be invalidated if a\nmortgagor successfully challenges the amounts the mortgagee has stated that it\nhas advanced for inspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance.\nInstead, the statute provides, \u201cIf a judgment in satisfaction of which lands, or\ntenements are sold, is reversed, such reversal shall not defeat or affect the title of\nthe purchaser.\u201d      (Emphasis added.)        R.C. 2329.45.   Furthermore, allowing\nmortgagors to appeal these amounts does not give those mortgagors a chance to\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f                                   January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\nundo the foreclosure judgment\u2014it merely allows them to challenge the accuracy\nof those amounts in determining the total amount owed by them to the mortgagee.\n                                     III. Conclusion\n          {\u00b6 43} We answer the two certified-conflict issues in the affirmative. A\njudgment decree in foreclosure that allows as part of recoverable damages\nunspecified amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals,\nproperty protection, and maintenance is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C.\n2505.02(B)(1). A mortgagor may contest amounts expended by a mortgagee for\ninspections, appraisals, property protection, and maintenance during proceedings\nto confirm the foreclosure sale and may appeal the order of confirmation of sale.\n          {\u00b6 44} We accordingly reverse the judgment of the court of appeals that\nthe trial court failed to issue a final, appealable order, and we remand the case to\nthe court of appeals so that it may consider the Roznowskis\u2019 remaining\nassignments of error.\n                                                                  Judgment reversed\n                                                                and cause remanded.\n          O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., and PFEIFER, O\u2019DONNELL, KENNEDY, and FRENCH, JJ.,\nconcur.\n          O\u2019NEILL, J., dissents.\n                               _____________________\n          O\u2019NEILL, J., dissenting.\n          {\u00b6 45} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s ruling on the first issue\npresented in this case. I would hold that a judgment decree in foreclosure that\nallows as part of recoverable damages, to be determined later by a formula,\nunspecified amounts advanced by the mortgagee for inspections, appraisals,\nproperty protection, and maintenance is a final, appealable order. I agree with the\nmajority\u2019s assertion that \u201c[l]iability is fully and finally established when the court\nissues the foreclosure decree and all that remains is mathematics, with the court\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nplugging in final amounts due after the property has been sold at a sheriff\u2019s sale.\u201d\nMajority opinion, \u00b6 25. However, I do not think that merely listing the categories\nof the unspecified amounts is sufficient to fully and finally establish liability. The\npossible interference with a mortgagor\u2019s right of redemption in these cases does\nnot necessarily arise from unscrupulous mortgagees willfully withholding the\namount of these unspecified expenses. The violation of due process comes from\nthe method of verifying the reasonableness of those expenses.               I share the\nobservation of the Fifth District Court of Appeals in this case that the dollar\namount of expenses incurred in property inspections, appraisal, preservation, and\nmaintenance is not easily ascertainable. 2012-Ohio-4901, \u00b6 9. Even if the final\nnumber is not available at the time of the order of foreclosure, mortgagees should\nbe made to show how they will arrive at this final number.                  An order is\nconclusively final and appealable \u201c \u2018where the computation of damages is\nmechanical and unlikely to produce a second appeal because only a ministerial\ntask similar to assessing costs remains.\u2019 \u201d Majority opinion, \u00b6 13, quoting State\nex rel. White v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). Anything less than this degree of specificity undermines the\nfinality of an order of foreclosure and invites error. I concur with the majority\nopinion as to the second issue; however, I dissent as to the first issue.\n        {\u00b6 46} In conclusion, I believe that an order is final and appealable only if\nall that remains is ministerial mathematical calculations arrived at by a method\nthat has been approved by the trial court in the order of foreclosure. In short, no\nadd-ons or surprises.     Anything less is a moving target, which will clearly\nundermine the finality of the order and lead to more, not less, confusion and\nlitigation.\n                              ____________________\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f                                 January Term, 2014\n\n\n\n\n       Carpenter, Lipps & Leland, L.L.P., David A.
