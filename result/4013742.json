He raises one issue\n\n      which we revise and restate as whether the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n      revoking his probation. We affirm.\n\n\n                                        Facts and Procedural History\n\n[2]   In December 2014, Jackson pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to\n\n      domestic battery as a class A misdemeanor. The court sentenced Jackson to\n\n      365 days with 359 days suspended to probation, and ordered that he have no\n\n      contact with Megan Martin pursuant to the plea agreement.\n\n\n[3]   On October 13, 2015, a Notice of Violation of Probation was filed alleging that\n\n      Martin made a police report on October 6, 2015, and that Jackson violated the\n\n      no contact order by leaving a note on her vehicle while she was at a friend\u2019s\n\n      house located at 7118 Gavin Drive.\n\n\n[4]   On October 21, 2015, the court held a hearing. Martin testified that Jackson\n\n      was her husband, that on October 6, 2015, she and her friend Ryan Christmas\n\n      were returning to Christmas\u2019s house on Gavin Drive, where Martin had left her\n\n      truck, that she observed Jackson driving his vehicle, and that she ducked down\n\n      in Christmas\u2019s vehicle so that Jackson would not see her.1 The State introduced\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        Martin testified that this occurred at \u201cThree-ish,\u201d and when asked if it \u201cwas late afternoon, early evening,\u201d\n      she answered \u201cYeah, in the late afternoon.\u201d Transcript at 7. The court admitted a police report \u201cto show the\n      time,\u201d transcript at 9, and the report stated: \u201cOccurred: 10/6/2015 at 17:20\u201d and \u201cReported: 10/6/2015 at\n      17:45.\u201d State\u2019s Exhibit 1.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016                   Page 2 of 8\n\f      an exhibit which Martin testified was a note that was left on her truck. The\n\n      typewritten note provides:\n\n\n              I need you. PLEASE. TODAY IS THE WORST DAY OF MY\n              LIFE. I FIND OUT YOU ARE CHEATING . . . GET THE\n              NEWS I JUST GOT. I WON\u2019T SAY A WORD ABOUT\n              WHAT YOU\u2019VE DONE. JUST . . .

On cross-examination, Martin testified that Christmas found\n\n      the note on her truck and handed it to her. Martin later testified: \u201cI ran\n\n      underneath the garage door. By the time it was all the way up, [Christmas] had\n\n      . . . come in with the note within minutes.\u201d Transcript at 22. On redirect, the\n\n      prosecutor asked \u201cdoes [Jackson] know what kind of truck you drive,\u201d and\n\n      Martin replied \u201c[y]es.\u201d Id. at 25.\n\n\n[5]   An employee of Marion County Community Corrections testified that her\n\n      duties included dealing with the GPS system, that they kept records of GPS\n\n      coordinates in the ordinary course of business, and that GPS coordinates for\n\n      Jackson showed that he was at 7118 Gavin Drive at 5:09 p.m. until at least 5:10\n\n      p.m. on October 6, 2015. When asked on cross-examination whether Jackson\n\n      was excluded from being in that area on October 6th, the employee testified\n\n      \u201c[o]n that date he was not excluded from being there\u201d and that \u201c[i]t has since\n\n      been added as a protected zone.\u201d Id. at 29.\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016   Page 3 of 8\n\f[6]   Jackson indicated that he worked in the mortgage business, that he had\n\n      previously asked to be placed on GPS, and that he did so \u201c[f]or an alibi,\n\n      basically.\u201d Id. at 37. He testified that he received a call from a potential\n\n      customer who asked him to come to his house on Gavin Drive, that this\n\n      happened all of the time, and that he set up a time with the person. When\n\n      asked if he had to obtain permission from home detention to do this, he testified\n\n      \u201c[t]ypically, something like this, no. . . . If I\u2019m doing something on personal\n\n      business, I have to get permission.\u201d Id. at 41. He indicated that he has \u201ca GPS\n\n      device that goes off if [he is] in the wrong area\u201d and that his device did not go\n\n      off. Id. When asked if he wrote the note, Jackson testified \u201cNo, I speak better\n\n      English than this.\u201d Id. at 42. Jackson indicated that he did not know\n\n      Christmas. He further indicated that he had \u201cbeen here\u201d and this was his \u201cthird\n\n      or fourth time,\u201d that he had been \u201cliving with the fear of can [he] make it\u201d to\n\n      December 11th \u201cto save [his] job\u201d and not go to jail, and that he has tried his\n\n      best to stay away from Martin. Id. at 43. Jackson testified that he thought he\n\n      was set up.\n\n\n[7]   The court asked Jackson if he had any paperwork or a call slip related to his\n\n      visit to the address on Gavin Drive, and Jackson answered that he did not, and\n\n      he testified that he did not do a loan, that he went to the home and no one was\n\n      there, that he did not record calls, and that he did not have a call log. The court\n\n      asked if he was allowed to \u201cgo and do whatever you want while you are\n\n      working as long as it\u2019s not personal,\u201d and Jackson replied \u201c[w]ell, she knows\n\n      what I do. I\u2019ve explained to her what I do. And I try to e-mail them . . . .\u201d Id.\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016   Page 4 of 8\n\f      at 49. The court asked if he sent an email on October 6th, and Jackson replied:\n\n      \u201cNo. Well, I talked to her about it and she was not in any way upset about it.\n\n      She understood.\u201d Id. at 50. The court asked \u201c[a]nd it happened to be at the\n\n      exact same address of 7118 Gavin,\u201d and Jackson answered \u201cYes. I think I was\n\n      set up. She said I was there at 1:30 and I wasn\u2019t. It was 5:00. So she obviously\n\n      didn\u2019t see me.\u201d Id.\n\n\n[8]   The trial court stated that it did not believe Jackson\u2019s version of what happened,\n\n      that there was proof by a preponderance of the evidence that Jackson went to\n\n      7118 Gavin Drive, the same place that a note was left, and that Martin testified\n\n      that she saw him. The court found Jackson in violation, gave him credit for the\n\n      time he was on home detention, and ordered that he serve the balance of his\n\n      suspended sentence in the Marion County Jail.\n\n\n                                                  Discussion\n\n[9]   The issue is whether the court abused its discretion in revoking Jackson\u2019s\n\n      probation. Jackson asserts that, \u201c[i]f indeed the typewritten note was placed on\n\n      [Martin\u2019s] truck by Jackson, that would be a violation of the no contact order.\n\n      However, there is no evidence that the note was put on [Martin\u2019s] truck by\n\n      Jackson and no evidence that Jackson wrote the note or had it put on [Martin\u2019s]\n\n      truck.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8. He argues that he had a legitimate explanation\n\n      for being at Gavin Drive that had nothing to do with Martin, that the only\n\n      evidence that the note was found on Martin\u2019s truck was hearsay evidence based\n\n      on what Christmas told her, that Christmas did not testify so he was not\n\n      afforded his due process right to confront him, and that there is nothing\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016   Page 5 of 8\n\f       inherent in Martin\u2019s testimony that makes Christmas\u2019s allegation substantially\n\n       trustworthy.\n\n\n[10]   The State argues that Jackson waived review of the admission of Martin\u2019s\n\n       testimony that Christmas found the note on her vehicle because he did not\n\n       object to the statements, that Jackson does not argue the admission of the\n\n       statements by Christmas to Martin were fundamental error, that Christmas\u2019s\n\n       statement about the location of the note was substantially trustworthy, and that\n\n       the Confrontation Clause is inapplicable to probation revocation proceedings.\n\n       The State further maintains that the court\u2019s determination that Jackson violated\n\n       his probation was supported by substantial evidence, that Martin saw Jackson\n\n       driving away from Christmas\u2019s house where her truck was parked, that\n\n       Jackson\u2019s GPS monitor confirmed that he was at Christmas\u2019s house for two\n\n       minutes that evening, that Christmas found the note on Martin\u2019s truck and\n\n       immediately gave it to her and told her where he had found it, and that the\n\n       court found that Jackson\u2019s completely unsupported explanation for his presence\n\n       at Christmas\u2019s house was not credible. In reply, Jackson argues that \u201c[t]he only\n\n       relevant evidence is that Jackson was at 7118 Gavin Drive just before [Martin]\n\n       got there and that [Martin\u2019s] friend handed a note to [Martin]\u201d and that,\n\n       \u201c[h]owever, there is nothing to connect the note with Jackson.\u201d Appellant\u2019s\n\n       Reply Brief at 5.\n\n\n[11]   With respect to the admission of Martin\u2019s testimony that Christmas told her\n\n       where he discovered the note and Jackson\u2019s right to confront Christmas, we\n\n       observe that Jackson did not object to this portion of Martin\u2019s testimony or\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016   Page 6 of 8\n\f       assert any right of confrontation. Accordingly, these issues are waived.2 See\n\n       Marsh v. State, 818 N.E.2d 143, 145 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004) (noting that the failure\n\n       to object to hearsay evidence at a probation revocation hearing waives the issue\n\n       for appeal); see also Small v.

He raises one issue\n\n      which we revise and restate as whether the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n      revoking his probation. We affirm.\n\n\n                                        Facts and Procedural History\n\n[2]   In December 2014, Jackson pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to\n\n      domestic battery as a class A misdemeanor. The court sentenced Jackson to\n\n      365 days with 359 days suspended to probation, and ordered that he have no\n\n      contact with Megan Martin pursuant to the plea agreement.\n\n\n[3]   On October 13, 2015, a Notice of Violation of Probation was filed alleging that\n\n      Martin made a police report on October 6, 2015, and that Jackson violated the\n\n      no contact order by leaving a note on her vehicle while she was at a friend\u2019s\n\n      house located at 7118 Gavin Drive.\n\n\n[4]   On October 21, 2015, the court held a hearing. Martin testified that Jackson\n\n      was her husband, that on October 6, 2015, she and her friend Ryan Christmas\n\n      were returning to Christmas\u2019s house on Gavin Drive, where Martin had left her\n\n      truck, that she observed Jackson driving his vehicle, and that she ducked down\n\n      in Christmas\u2019s vehicle so that Jackson would not see her.1 The State introduced\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        Martin testified that this occurred at \u201cThree-ish,\u201d and when asked if it \u201cwas late afternoon, early evening,\u201d\n      she answered \u201cYeah, in the late afternoon.\u201d Transcript at 7. The court admitted a police report \u201cto show the\n      time,\u201d transcript at 9, and the report stated: \u201cOccurred: 10/6/2015 at 17:20\u201d and \u201cReported: 10/6/2015 at\n      17:45.\u201d State\u2019s Exhibit 1.\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016                   Page 2 of 8\n\f      an exhibit which Martin testified was a note that was left on her truck. The\n\n      typewritten note provides:\n\n\n              I need you. PLEASE. TODAY IS THE WORST DAY OF MY\n              LIFE. I FIND OUT YOU ARE CHEATING . . .

On cross-examination, Martin testified that Christmas found\n\n      the note on her truck and handed it to her. Martin later testified: \u201cI ran\n\n      underneath the garage door. By the time it was all the way up, [Christmas] had\n\n      . . . come in with the note within minutes.\u201d Transcript at 22. On redirect, the\n\n      prosecutor asked \u201cdoes [Jackson] know what kind of truck you drive,\u201d and\n\n      Martin replied \u201c[y]es.\u201d Id. at 25.\n\n\n[5]   An employee of Marion County Community Corrections testified that her\n\n      duties included dealing with the GPS system, that they kept records of GPS\n\n      coordinates in the ordinary course of business, and that GPS coordinates for\n\n      Jackson showed that he was at 7118 Gavin Drive at 5:09 p.m. until at least 5:10\n\n      p.m. on October 6, 2015. When asked on cross-examination whether Jackson\n\n      was excluded from being in that area on October 6th, the employee testified\n\n      \u201c[o]n that date he was not excluded from being there\u201d and that \u201c[i]t has since\n\n      been added as a protected zone.\u201d Id. at 29.\n\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016   Page 3 of 8\n\f[6]   Jackson indicated that he worked in the mortgage business, that he had\n\n      previously asked to be placed on GPS, and that he did so \u201c[f]or an alibi,\n\n      basically.\u201d Id. at 37. He testified that he received a call from a potential\n\n      customer who asked him to come to his house on Gavin Drive, that this\n\n      happened all of the time, and that he set up a time with the person. When\n\n      asked if he had to obtain permission from home detention to do this, he testified\n\n      \u201c[t]ypically, something like this, no. . . . If I\u2019m doing something on personal\n\n      business, I have to get permission.\u201d Id. at 41. He indicated that he has \u201ca GPS\n\n      device that goes off if [he is] in the wrong area\u201d and that his device did not go\n\n      off. Id. When asked if he wrote the note, Jackson testified \u201cNo, I speak better\n\n      English than this.\u201d Id. at 42. Jackson indicated that he did not know\n\n      Christmas. He further indicated that he had \u201cbeen here\u201d and this was his \u201cthird\n\n      or fourth time,\u201d that he had been \u201cliving with the fear of can [he] make it\u201d to\n\n      December 11th \u201cto save [his] job\u201d and not go to jail, and that he has tried his\n\n      best to stay away from Martin. Id. at 43. Jackson testified that he thought he\n\n      was set up.\n\n\n[7]   The court asked Jackson if he had any paperwork or a call slip related to his\n\n      visit to the address on Gavin Drive, and Jackson answered that he did not, and\n\n      he testified that he did not do a loan, that he went to the home and no one was\n\n      there, that he did not record calls, and that he did not have a call log. The court\n\n      asked if he was allowed to \u201cgo and do whatever you want while you are\n\n      working as long as it\u2019s not personal,\u201d and Jackson replied \u201c[w]ell, she knows\n\n      what I do. I\u2019ve explained to her what I do. And I try to e-mail them . . . .\u201d Id.\n\n\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016   Page 4 of 8\n\f      at 49. The court asked if he sent an email on October 6th, and Jackson replied:\n\n      \u201cNo. Well, I talked to her about it and she was not in any way upset about it.\n\n      She understood.\u201d Id. at 50. The court asked \u201c[a]nd it happened to be at the\n\n      exact same address of 7118 Gavin,\u201d and Jackson answered \u201cYes. I think I was\n\n      set up. She said I was there at 1:30 and I wasn\u2019t. It was 5:00. So she obviously\n\n      didn\u2019t see me.\u201d Id.\n\n\n[8]   The trial court stated that it did not believe Jackson\u2019s version of what happened,\n\n      that there was proof by a preponderance of the evidence that Jackson went to\n\n      7118 Gavin Drive, the same place that a note was left, and that Martin testified\n\n      that she saw him. The court found Jackson in violation, gave him credit for the\n\n      time he was on home detention, and ordered that he serve the balance of his\n\n      suspended sentence in the Marion County Jail.\n\n\n                                                  Discussion\n\n[9]   The issue is whether the court abused its discretion in revoking Jackson\u2019s\n\n      probation. Jackson asserts that, \u201c[i]f indeed the typewritten note was placed on\n\n      [Martin\u2019s] truck by Jackson, that would be a violation of the no contact order.\n\n      However, there is no evidence that the note was put on [Martin\u2019s] truck by\n\n      Jackson and no evidence that Jackson wrote the note or had it put on [Martin\u2019s]\n\n      truck.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8. He argues that he had a legitimate explanation\n\n      for being at Gavin Drive that had nothing to do with Martin, that the only\n\n      evidence that the note was found on Martin\u2019s truck was hearsay evidence based\n\n      on what Christmas told her, that Christmas did not testify so he was not\n\n      afforded his due process right to confront him, and that there is nothing\n      Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016   Page 5 of 8\n\f       inherent in Martin\u2019s testimony that makes Christmas\u2019s allegation substantially\n\n       trustworthy.\n\n\n[10]   The State argues that Jackson waived review of the admission of Martin\u2019s\n\n       testimony that Christmas found the note on her vehicle because he did not\n\n       object to the statements, that Jackson does not argue the admission of the\n\n       statements by Christmas to Martin were fundamental error, that Christmas\u2019s\n\n       statement about the location of the note was substantially trustworthy, and that\n\n       the Confrontation Clause is inapplicable to probation revocation proceedings.\n\n       The State further maintains that the court\u2019s determination that Jackson violated\n\n       his probation was supported by substantial evidence, that Martin saw Jackson\n\n       driving away from Christmas\u2019s house where her truck was parked, that\n\n       Jackson\u2019s GPS monitor confirmed that he was at Christmas\u2019s house for two\n\n       minutes that evening, that Christmas found the note on Martin\u2019s truck and\n\n       immediately gave it to her and told her where he had found it, and that the\n\n       court found that Jackson\u2019s completely unsupported explanation for his presence\n\n       at Christmas\u2019s house was not credible. In reply, Jackson argues that \u201c[t]he only\n\n       relevant evidence is that Jackson was at 7118 Gavin Drive just before [Martin]\n\n       got there and that [Martin\u2019s] friend handed a note to [Martin]\u201d and that,\n\n       \u201c[h]owever, there is nothing to connect the note with Jackson.\u201d Appellant\u2019s\n\n       Reply Brief at 5.\n\n\n[11]   With respect to the admission of Martin\u2019s testimony that Christmas told her\n\n       where he discovered the note and Jackson\u2019s right to confront Christmas, we\n\n       observe that Jackson did not object to this portion of Martin\u2019s testimony or\n\n       Court of Appeals of Indiana | Memorandum Decision 49A02-1512-CR-2106|July 7, 2016   Page 6 of 8\n\f       assert any right of confrontation.
