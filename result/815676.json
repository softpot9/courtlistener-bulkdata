Dunn pleaded guilty to credit union fraud in violation of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1344 and money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i).\nThe district court sentenced Dunn to concurrent terms of 97 months in prison.\n       Dunn argues that the district court committed reversible error when it did\nnot make an explicit competency determination following her competency\nhearing. She asserts that because she was not competent, her guilty plea is\nunknowing and involuntary. We review this claim for plain error. See United\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 12-30554     Document: 00512118353     Page: 2    Date Filed: 01/18/2013\n\n                                  No. 12-30554\n\nStates v. Krout, 66 F.3d 1420, 1434 (5th Cir. 1995). Under the plain error\nstandard, Dunn must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected her\nsubstantial rights. See Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 135 (2009). If\nDunn makes the required showing, we retain the discretion to correct the error\nonly if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the\nproceedings. Id.\n      Even if we assume that the district court committed an error that was\nclear or obvious, Dunn has not established that the error affected her substantial\nrights. The record as a whole shows that Dunn was competent when she pleaded\nguilty. Further, Dunn does not identify the proceedings that she was not able\nto comprehend, and she does not assert that she was unable to consult with her\nlawyer or participate in her defense. See Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 389, 396\n(1993). Accordingly, Dunn has not established that her substantial rights were\naffected by the district court\u2019s failure to make an explicit competency\ndetermination following her competency hearing.            See United States v.\nBroussard, 669 F.3d 537, 553 (5th Cir. 2012); United States v. Hutson, 821 F.2d\n1015, 1018 (5th Cir. 1987).\n      Dunn also argues that her trial attorney performed ineffectively by failing\nto object to the district court\u2019s failure to make an explicit competency\ndetermination. We generally do not consider ineffective assistance claims on\ndirect appeal,. United States v. Cantwell, 470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir. 2006).\nThe record in this case is not sufficiently developed for such a determination.\nAccordingly, we decline to consider the issue.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">     Case: 12-30554       Document: 00512118353         Page: 1     Date Filed: 01/18/2013\n\n\n\n\n           IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                    FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT  United States Court of Appeals\n                                                    Fifth Circuit\n\n                                                                            FILED\n                                                                         January 18, 2013\n                                     No. 12-30554\n                                   Summary Calendar                        Lyle W.
