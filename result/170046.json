Because we find that neither Mr. Garcia-Ramirez nor his counsel raises any\n\nnon-frivolous issue on appeal, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss\n\nthe appeal.\n\n                         I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n      Mr. Garcia-Ramirez is a serial illegal immigrant and felon. He has been\n\ndeported to Mexico on at least four occasions, and continues to reenter the United\n\nStates illegally. Most recently, after serving three years in federal prison in Texas\n\nfor illegal entry, he was released and deported on June 10, 2005. Only six months\n\nlater, on January 20, 2006, he again entered the country illegally\u2014the instant\n\noffense\u2014while still serving unsupervised release from the previous offense. The\n\nPresentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared by the United States Probation\n\nOffice in this case reflects that Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s rap sheet also includes two\n\nfelony counts of controlled substance possession, felony distribution, another\n\nmisdemeanor possession count, three counts of criminal trespass, and a charge of\n\ndrinking in public, for which he never paid the fine. His other arrests include a\n\nvariety of drug and immigration offenses. A warrant for his arrest, for violating\n\nprobation, is outstanding in Missouri.\n\n      In this case, Mr. Garcia-Ramirez was charged with violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n\n1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2), in that, having previously been deported from the\n\nUnited States \u201csubsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated\n\n                                         -2-\n\ffelony,\u201d he \u201center[ed], attempt[ed] to enter, or [was] at any time found in, the\n\nUnited States\u201d without the permission of the Attorney General. He pleaded\n\nguilty. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the PSR calculated Mr. Garcia-\n\nRamirez\u2019s total offense level at 17 and his criminal history score at 14, placing\n\nhim in criminal history category VI. The advisory Guidelines sentence for such\n\nan offender is 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n      The district judge calculated Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s total offense level to be\n\n17. This reflected a base offense level of 8 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), a 12-level\n\nenhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) for commission of the re-entry offense\n\nsubsequent to \u201ca conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the\n\nsentence imposed was 13 months or less,\u201d and a 3-level reduction for acceptance\n\nof responsibility. The judge additionally applied a 2-level downward variance for\n\na fast-track plea which the government had offered but had revoked between the\n\ndefendant\u2019s acceptance and the finalization of the agreement. The judge\n\nacknowledged that the correctly calculated criminal history category for Mr.\n\nGarcia-Ramirez was VI; the Guidelines range was therefore 41 to 51 months. The\n\njudge, however, found that the category of VI over-represented Mr. Garcia-\n\nRamirez\u2019s actual criminal history, and elected to depart downward from this range\n\nto sentence him as though his criminal history category were V. See id. \u00a7\n\n4A1.3(b)(i). An offense level of 15 and criminal history category of V would\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fproduce a Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months, and the judge gave Mr. Garcia-\n\nRamirez the bottommost sentence in this range.\n\n      Mr. Garcia-Ramirez filed a timely notice of appeal of the conviction and\n\nsentence. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and Anders brief followed. Under\n\nAnders, a court-appointed defense counsel who believes that an appeal would be\n\n\u201cwholly frivolous\u201d may withdraw only upon submission of a brief to the client\n\nand the court indicating \u201canything in the record that might arguably support the\n\nappeal.\u201d Anders v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"/opinion/107423/anders-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744 (1967). The defendant may\n\nthen choose to submit arguments to the court. United States v. Calderon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166630\"><a href=\"/opinion/166630/united-states-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 930 (10th Cir. 2005). If we conclude, after a full examination of the\n\nrecord before us, that the appeal is frivolous, we will grant motion to withdraw\n\nand dismiss the appeal. Id.; Anders, 386 U.S. at 744.\n\n                                II. DISCUSSION\n\n                   A. Validity of Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2\n\n      The first issue presented in the Anders brief is a facial challenge under the\n\nEighth Amendment to the validity of \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. That\n\nguideline sets a base offense level of 8 for crimes of unlawfully entering or\n\nremaining in the United States, and specifies enhancements in the offense level\n\nfor defendants who have previously been convicted of other crimes. The district\n\ncourt held that Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s base offense level was subject to a twelve-\n\nlevel enhancement because his immigration violation was committed after his\n\n                                         -4-\n\fdeportation on an earlier \u201cconviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for\n\nwhich the sentence imposed was 13 months or less.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B).\n\n      Appellant challenges this guideline on the grounds that a sentence under it\n\nis cruel and unusual, and that the use of a prior felony conviction to determine the\n\noffense level, when the same prior conviction also contributes to the defendant\u2019s\n\ncriminal history category, is an impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d of the\n\nconviction. Appellate counsel is correct that these arguments are frivolous.\n\n      The statutory maximum for the crime to which Mr. Garcia-Ramirez pled\n\nguilty is twenty years, or 240 months, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and \u201ca sentence\n\nwithin the prescribed statutory limits generally will not be found to be cruel and\n\nunusual.\u201d United States v. Newsome, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537821\"><a href=\"/opinion/537821/united-states-v-willie-taw-newsome/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 122 (10th Cir. 1990).

Delacruz-Soto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166118\"><a href=\"/opinion/166118/united-states-v-delacruz-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1168 (10th Cir. 2005), we\n\naffirmed, upon an Eighth Amendment challenge, a 46-month sentence for a\n\nviolation of the same offense, interpreted under the same guideline, to which Mr.\n\nGarcia-Ramirez pled guilty. See also, e.g., United States v. Johnstone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199430\"><a href=\"/opinion/199430/united-states-v-johnstone/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286 n.7 (1st Cir. 2001) (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to 45-month\n\nsentence under same statute); United States v.

Cupa-Guillen,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677443\"><a href=\"/opinion/677443/united-states-v-jose-luis-cupa-guillen/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 865 (9th Cir. 1994) (same; 100-month sentence). Appellant\u2019s\n\nargument that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment is therefore foreclosed\n\nby precedent.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f      Appellant\u2019s alternative argument that it is impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d\n\nto use a previous felony conviction to calculate both the defendant\u2019s offense level\n\nand his criminal history category is likewise without merit. For offenses relating\n\nto illegal reentry, a previous felony is factored into the offense level because \u201cwe\n\nfind it particularly troublesome to have illegal aliens returning who are not just\n\nillegal aliens, but also criminals. The criminal history category, however, serves\n\nthe different purpose of evaluating the likelihood that any defendant will commit\n\nanother crime in the future.\u201d United States v. Olmos-Esparza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797618\"><a href=\"/opinion/797618/united-states-v-leobardo-olmos-esparza/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1115 (9th Cir. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

Classification of Offense as Felony\n\n      The second issue raised in Appellant\u2019s Anders brief is whether the\n\nclassification of a prior crime as a felony or a misdemeanor is a fact which must\n\nbe proven to a jury if not admitted by the defendant. Here, the application of\n\nGuideline 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) turns on whether Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s 1993 drug\n\ntrafficking conviction in Utah, the basis for the enhancement, was \u201ca felony drug\n\n                                         -6-\n\ftrafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less.\u201d Mr.\n\nGarcia-Ramirez argues that, because he did not admit that the offense was a\n\nfelony, and because this was not proven by the government prior to sentencing,\n\nthe guideline cannot be applied to him.\n\n      This \u201cargument simply miscasts a legal conclusion as a factual dispute.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Cordova-Arevalo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167928\"><a href=\"/opinion/167928/united-states-v-cordova-arevalo/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1232 (10th Cir. 2006). Once\n\nthe offense itself has been admitted to, its classification for sentencing purposes is\n\na matter of federal law. On this question, it is clear that \u201cfelony,\u201d under this\n\nguideline, means any offense punishable by death or any term of imprisonment\n\nexceeding one year. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. 2; Cordova-Arevalo, 456 F.3d at\n\n1232\u201333; see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3156(a)(3); U.S.C.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(o). As a legal\n\nmatter, it is apparent from the face of the statute under which Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\n\nwas convicted, Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-37-8 (1993), that the maximum penalty\n\nexceeded one year\u2019s imprisonment. See id. \u00a7 76-3-203. Mr. Garcia-Ramirez was\n\nactually sentenced to a term of five years, with all but six months suspended. The\n\n12-level enhancement\u2014applicable where the maximum term of imprisonment is\n\ngreater than one year and the term actually served was 13 months or\n\nless\u2014therefore applies, and his argument to the contrary is meritless.\n\n      Moreover, at Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s plea hearing, the following colloquy\n\ntook place:\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f      THE COURT: Have you previously been in the United States and\n      while here did you commit and were you convicted of an aggravated\n      felony, distribution of a controlled substance?\n\n      MR. GARCIA-RAMIREZ: Yes.\n\nR. Vol. IV, at 24 (emphasis added). Even if, then, he were correct that the\n\nclassification of his prior offense as a felony should be considered a factual\n\nmatter, he has admitted it, and that fact was properly used at sentencing.\n\n                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n      Our review of counsel\u2019s Anders brief, as well as of the remainder of the\n\nrecord, reveals no non-frivolous issues for appeal. We therefore GRANT\n\ncounsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.

Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the PSR calculated Mr. Garcia-\n\nRamirez\u2019s total offense level at 17 and his criminal history score at 14, placing\n\nhim in criminal history category VI. The advisory Guidelines sentence for such\n\nan offender is 51 to 63 months\u2019 imprisonment.\n\n      The district judge calculated Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s total offense level to be\n\n17. This reflected a base offense level of 8 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), a 12-level\n\nenhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) for commission of the re-entry offense\n\nsubsequent to \u201ca conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the\n\nsentence imposed was 13 months or less,\u201d and a 3-level reduction for acceptance\n\nof responsibility. The judge additionally applied a 2-level downward variance for\n\na fast-track plea which the government had offered but had revoked between the\n\ndefendant\u2019s acceptance and the finalization of the agreement. The judge\n\nacknowledged that the correctly calculated criminal history category for Mr.\n\nGarcia-Ramirez was VI; the Guidelines range was therefore 41 to 51 months. The\n\njudge, however, found that the category of VI over-represented Mr. Garcia-\n\nRamirez\u2019s actual criminal history, and elected to depart downward from this range\n\nto sentence him as though his criminal history category were V. See id. \u00a7\n\n4A1.3(b)(i). An offense level of 15 and criminal history category of V would\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fproduce a Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months, and the judge gave Mr. Garcia-\n\nRamirez the bottommost sentence in this range.\n\n      Mr. Garcia-Ramirez filed a timely notice of appeal of the conviction and\n\nsentence. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and Anders brief followed. Under\n\nAnders, a court-appointed defense counsel who believes that an appeal would be\n\n\u201cwholly frivolous\u201d may withdraw only upon submission of a brief to the client\n\nand the court indicating \u201canything in the record that might arguably support the\n\nappeal.\u201d Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967). The defendant may\n\nthen choose to submit arguments to the court. United States v. Calderon, 428\n\nF.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir. 2005). If we conclude, after a full examination of the\n\nrecord before us, that the appeal is frivolous, we will grant motion to withdraw\n\nand dismiss the appeal. Id.; Anders, 386 U.S. at 744.\n\n                                II. DISCUSSION\n\n                   A. Validity of Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2\n\n      The first issue presented in the Anders brief is a facial challenge under the\n\nEighth Amendment to the validity of \u00a7 2L1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. That\n\nguideline sets a base offense level of 8 for crimes of unlawfully entering or\n\nremaining in the United States, and specifies enhancements in the offense level\n\nfor defendants who have previously been convicted of other crimes. The district\n\ncourt held that Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s base offense level was subject to a twelve-\n\nlevel enhancement because his immigration violation was committed after his\n\n                                         -4-\n\fdeportation on an earlier \u201cconviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for\n\nwhich the sentence imposed was 13 months or less.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B).\n\n      Appellant challenges this guideline on the grounds that a sentence under it\n\nis cruel and unusual, and that the use of a prior felony conviction to determine the\n\noffense level, when the same prior conviction also contributes to the defendant\u2019s\n\ncriminal history category, is an impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d of the\n\nconviction. Appellate counsel is correct that these arguments are frivolous.\n\n      The statutory maximum for the crime to which Mr. Garcia-Ramirez pled\n\nguilty is twenty years, or 240 months, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and \u201ca sentence\n\nwithin the prescribed statutory limits generally will not be found to be cruel and\n\nunusual.\u201d United States v. Newsome, 898 F.2d 119, 122 (10th Cir. 1990). In\n\nUnited States v. Delacruz-Soto, 414 F.3d 1158, 1168 (10th Cir. 2005), we\n\naffirmed, upon an Eighth Amendment challenge, a 46-month sentence for a\n\nviolation of the same offense, interpreted under the same guideline, to which Mr.\n\nGarcia-Ramirez pled guilty. See also, e.g., United States v. Johnstone, 251 F.3d\n\n281, 286 n.7 (1st Cir. 2001) (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to 45-month\n\nsentence under same statute); United States v. Cardenas-Alvarez, 987 F.2d 1129,\n\n1134 (5th Cir. 1993) (same; 100-month sentence); United States v. Cupa-Guillen,\n\n34 F.3d 860, 865 (9th Cir. 1994) (same; 100-month sentence). Appellant\u2019s\n\nargument that his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment is therefore foreclosed\n\nby precedent.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f      Appellant\u2019s alternative argument that it is impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d\n\nto use a previous felony conviction to calculate both the defendant\u2019s offense level\n\nand his criminal history category is likewise without merit. For offenses relating\n\nto illegal reentry, a previous felony is factored into the offense level because \u201cwe\n\nfind it particularly troublesome to have illegal aliens returning who are not just\n\nillegal aliens, but also criminals. The criminal history category, however, serves\n\nthe different purpose of evaluating the likelihood that any defendant will commit\n\nanother crime in the future.\u201d United States v. Olmos-Esparza, 484 F.3d 1111,\n\n1115 (9th Cir. 2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have\n\nrepeatedly and consistently upheld sentences where the offense level and criminal\n\nhistory both reflect the same prior criminal activity. E.g., United States v. Ruiz-\n\nTerrazas, 477 F.3d 1196, 1204 (10th Cir. 2007); United States v.\n\nMurriega-Santos, 2006 WL 3291683 at *2 (10th Cir. Nov.14, 2006)\n\n(unpublished); United States v. Hernandez-Juarez, 185 F. App\u2019x 758, 762\u201363\n\n(10th Cir. 2006) (unpublished).\n\n                       B. Classification of Offense as Felony\n\n      The second issue raised in Appellant\u2019s Anders brief is whether the\n\nclassification of a prior crime as a felony or a misdemeanor is a fact which must\n\nbe proven to a jury if not admitted by the defendant. Here, the application of\n\nGuideline 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) turns on whether Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s 1993 drug\n\ntrafficking conviction in Utah, the basis for the enhancement, was \u201ca felony drug\n\n                                         -6-\n\ftrafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less.\u201d Mr.\n\nGarcia-Ramirez argues that, because he did not admit that the offense was a\n\nfelony, and because this was not proven by the government prior to sentencing,\n\nthe guideline cannot be applied to him.\n\n      This \u201cargument simply miscasts a legal conclusion as a factual dispute.\u201d\n\nUnited States v. Cordova-Arevalo, 456 F.3d 1229, 1232 (10th Cir. 2006). Once\n\nthe offense itself has been admitted to, its classification for sentencing purposes is\n\na matter of federal law. On this question, it is clear that \u201cfelony,\u201d under this\n\nguideline, means any offense punishable by death or any term of imprisonment\n\nexceeding one year. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. 2; Cordova-Arevalo, 456 F.3d at\n\n1232\u201333; see also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3156(a)(3); U.S.C.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(o). As a legal\n\nmatter, it is apparent from the face of the statute under which Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\n\nwas convicted, Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-37-8 (1993), that the maximum penalty\n\nexceeded one year\u2019s imprisonment. See id. \u00a7 76-3-203. Mr. Garcia-Ramirez was\n\nactually sentenced to a term of five years, with all but six months suspended. The\n\n12-level enhancement\u2014applicable where the maximum term of imprisonment is\n\ngreater than one year and the term actually served was 13 months or\n\nless\u2014therefore applies, and his argument to the contrary is meritless.\n\n      Moreover, at Mr. Garcia-Ramirez\u2019s plea hearing, the following colloquy\n\ntook place:\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f      THE COURT: Have you previously been in the United States and\n      while here did you commit and were you convicted of an aggravated\n      felony, distribution of a controlled substance?\n\n      MR. GARCIA-RAMIREZ: Yes.\n\nR. Vol. IV, at 24 (emphasis added). Even if, then, he were correct that the\n\nclassification of his prior offense as a felony should be considered a factual\n\nmatter, he has admitted it, and that fact was properly used at sentencing.\n\n                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n      Our review of counsel\u2019s Anders brief, as well as of the remainder of the\n\nrecord, reveals no non-frivolous issues for appeal. We therefore GRANT\n\ncounsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal. The judgment of the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Mexico is AFFIRMED.\n\n                                                     Entered for the Court,\n\n                                                     Michael W.
