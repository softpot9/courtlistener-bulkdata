Timely notice of appeal was filed and jurisdiction of this Court is based upon &#167; 7482(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case was submitted to the Tax Court for decision on a stipulated administrative record.  The record reflects that Metropolitan Senior Federation (Metropolitan), a nonprofit Minnesota corporation whose purpose is to enhance the well-being of Minneapolis-St. Paul senior citizens, organized the Federation.  Prior to Federation's formation, Script Shoppes, Inc., (Script), a commercial pharmacy, had agreed with Metropolitan to provide senior citizens with prescription drugs at 10 percent off the lowest retail price in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and to make free or low-cost delivery of those drugs to certain senior citizens.  But Script incurred substantial losses and consequently was forced to discontinue its operation in December 1976.  In order to preserve the services that Script had rendered to the elderly, Metropolitan acquired its remaining assets and transferred them to Federation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to its articles of incorporation, Federation was organized for the purposes of operating a nonprofit pharmaceutical service for the general public, with special discount rates for senior citizens and handicapped citizens in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its application for recognition of exemption under &#167; 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the Federation proposed to sell prescription drugs to its members at a price of 5 percent below the lowest price charged for such items at local for-profit pharmacies, as established by a price survey.  Nonmembers would be obliged to pay the established survey price for their drug purchases.  Federation's bylaws provide that its members shall consist of those people \"who are holders of a VIP Buying Plan card issued by (Metropolitan).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The administrative record fails to reveal the criteria used to determine who is eligible to become such a cardholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its application for tax-exempt status Federation stated that all customers, whether members or not, would be required to pay for their drug purchases.  Federation gave no commitment that it would reduce prices in any instance below cost, and the organization was not obligated to provide free drugs to any indigent persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to meet its operating costs Federation expected to rely on the assistance of volunteers to perform certain duties and financial contributions.  However, it was admitted that the primary source of income would be derived from its prescription drug sales and that Federation had not formulated a program for soliciting contributions.  Federation planned to promote its products through advertising, principally directed at senior citizens and the handicapped.  After adverse rulings from the Tax Commission, Federation then petitioned the Tax Court for a declaratory judgment relating to its classification as a &#167; 501(c)(3) organization.  The majority of the Court held that Federation must be denied tax-exempt status because \"it is operated for a substantial commercial purpose.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Court emphasized that the selling of prescription drugs at a discount to the elderly and the handicapped does not in itself manifest a charitable purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only issue before this Court is whether the Tax Court correctly decided that Federation does not qualify as a tax-exempt organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federation contends that its activities accomplish two exempt purposes the promotion of health and the relief of financial distress of the aged and the handicapped.  The burden of proving entitlement to an exemption lies with the party claiming it.  In the instant case, the Tax Court held that Federation failed to carry that burden and that it operated for a substantial commercial purpose rather than for an exclusively charitable purpose.  This factual finding of the Tax Court may not be disturbed on appeal unless it is shown to be clearly erroneous.  Parker v.

Any surplus proceeds were used to reduce future subscription rates or increase services and the corporate officers performed their duties without compensation.  But the corporation solicited no charitable contributions and its subscribers were required to pay the fee charged in order to receive its benefits.

As in Hassett, its officers received no compensation.  But the corporation here, too, solicited no contributions and, therefore, while giving some consideration to the client's ability to pay, planned to charge a sufficient fee which would enable it to recover its costs plus a small profit.

Although its members are allowed a 5 percent discount,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> there is no evidence that Federation has ever offered or is committed to offer its products to any customer below cost.  Further, it should be noted that the use of volunteers by Federation to defray its costs does not negate the existence of a commercial purpose.  See Hassett v. Associated Hospital Service Corp., supra, p. 614; B.S.W. Group, Inc. v. Commissioner, supra, p. 358 (corporate officers served without pay).  It is immaterial that Federation's objectives may be laudable.  In the case of Est of Hawaii v. Commissioner, (<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></span>, p. 1082) (1979), the Tax Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>We do not question the sincerity or dedication of petitioner's members.  But it is petitioner's activities and not its members' devotion to their work that determines whether it is entitled to exemption from taxation.  Scripture Press Foundation v. United States, 285 F.2d at 804.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, in order for an organization to qualify for exemption under &#167; 501(c) (3) the organization must \"establish\" that it is neither organized nor operated for the \"benefit of private interests.\"  Only Federation's card-holding members are eligible to purchase drugs at a discount.  There is no showing one needs financial assistance or is indigent to receive a card.  Thus, it has not been \"established\" that the recipients of any benefits derived from Federation do not represent \"private interests.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, we find Federation relies financially on the sale of prescription drugs to the public with no accommodation made for those unable to pay.  As a consequence, it is engaged in competition with for-profit pharmacies in the area.  Nor does the administrative record indicate any other activity on Federation's part which establishes the requisite charitable purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we find that the Tax Court's decision that Federation operates for a substantial commercial purpose and does not qualify as a charitable organization exempt from tax under &#167; 501(c)(3) of the Code is not clearly erroneous, but is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Honorable Elsijane T.

Federation is also open to the public.

See B.S.W. Group, Inc. v. Commissioner, supra, p. 360; Lorain Ave. Clinic v. Commissioner, p. 161.  The Court also takes judicial notice of the fact that many banks, restaurants, transportation carriers, and other competitive for-profit establishments give special discounts or other preferred treatment to senior citizens</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ", "Case_Text": "", "Reporter_Citation": "625 F.2d 804", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 13, "CL_opinion_sha1": "1ad3c2008a3fb6efe7ee88d8746b905d82458aab", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/108754/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/109413/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/109748/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/225584/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/252806/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/262357/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/268926/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/273016/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/275131/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/348356/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/366382/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1371029/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1477360/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2011-08-23T09:14:21Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": null, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/380193/federation-pharmacy-services-inc-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "380193", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "625 F.2d 804 (July 11,1980)", "CL_opinion_local_path": null, "LDA_Model_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_cluster": {"state_cite_two": "", "date_blocked": null, "syllabus": "", "posture": "", "federal_cite_one": "625 F.2d 804", "case_name_short": "", "date_filed": "1980-07-11", "federal_cite_two": "", "docket": {"court": {"has_opinion_scraper": true, "in_use": true, "url": "http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/", "start_date": "1891-03-03", "full_name": "Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit", "date_modified": "2014-10-31T01:58:29.750000Z", "position": 108.0, "jurisdiction": "F", "has_oral_argument_scraper": true, "resource_uri": "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/courts/ca8/", "citation_string": "8th Cir.", "short_name": "Eighth Circuit", "end_date": null}, "date_blocked": null, "filepath_ia": null, "docket_number": "79-1883", "date_argued": null, "date_reargued": null, "cause": null, "case_name_short": "", "date_filed": null, "filepath_local": null, "date_cert_denied": null, "source": 0, "assigned_to": null, "clusters": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/380193/"], "jurisdiction_type": null, "audio_files": [], "date_reargument_denied": null, "date_terminated": null, "case_name_full": "", "date_created": "2014-10-30T13:19:49.961737Z", "slug": "federation-pharmacy-services-inc-v-commissioner-of", "nature_of_suit": null, "date_modified": "2014-10-30T13:19:49.961737Z", "date_cert_granted": null, "jury_demand": null, "blocked": false, "case_name": "Federation Pharmacy Services, Inc. v.
