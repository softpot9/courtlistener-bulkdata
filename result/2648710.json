We must also decide whether petitioner failed to\n\nreport certain income for 1996, 1997 and 1998. We hold that he did not report\n\nthat income. We must also decide whether petitioner is liable for the fraud penalty\n\nunder section 6663. We hold that petitioner is liable.\n\n                               FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      The parties have stipulated some facts. We incorporate the stipulation of\n\nfacts and accompanying exhibits by this reference. Petitioner resided in Texas\n\nwhen he filed the petition.\n\nI. Petitioner\u2019s Employment and Dealings\n\n      A. Petitioner\u2019s Background\n\n      Petitioner is an experienced and savvy businessman. Petitioner earned a\n\nbusiness administration degree from the University of Houston in 1975. In the\n\n1980s petitioner organized various business entities engaged in residential real\n\nestate projects. Petitioner then worked as a salaried employee for the better part of\n\nthe next decade.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        (...continued)\nissue, and all Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and\nProcedure, unless otherwise indicated.\n\f                                         -3-\n\n[*3] B. Seaboard Controls\n\n      Petitioner served as bookkeeper for Seaboard Controls (Seaboard) from\n\n1992 to March 1994 and prepared its Federal income tax returns.\n\n      Seaboard was involved in a project for the Venezuelan Government\n\n(Venezuelan project). To that end, Seaboard tasked petitioner with obtaining\n\nfinancing on Seaboard\u2019s behalf. Petitioner was unsuccessful, and Seaboard\n\nultimately lost money on the Venezuelan project.\n\n      Seaboard never had a profit-sharing agreement with petitioner relating to\n\nthe Venezuelan project. Petitioner never requested Seaboard to satisfy any\n\npurported debt.\n\n      C. Bank Fraud Incarceration\n\n      Petitioner was incarcerated from April 1994 to December 1995 for a Federal\n\nbank fraud conviction. Petitioner was not employed, nor did he earn income\n\nduring his incarceration.\n\n      D. Houston Drywall\n\n      Houston Drywall, Inc. (Houston Drywall), d.b.a. Classic Contractors of\n\nHouston, Inc. (Classic Contractors), hired petitioner as a salesman after his\n\nincarceration. Houston Drywall paid petitioner wages during each year at issue.\n\f                                          -4-\n\n[*4] Petitioner also prepared Federal tax returns for Classic Contractors for 1998\n\nthrough 2001.\n\n      Classic Contractors paid petitioner an additional $28,8172 in 1996, $37,173\n\nin 1997 and $9,400 in 1998. Classic Contractors filed Forms 1099-MISC,\n\nMiscellaneous Income, for those years (1099 income).\n\n      E. Kingwood Project\n\n      Petitioner proposed a residential real estate project in Kingwood, Texas\n\n(Kingwood project). Classic Contractors agreed to purchase a tract of land for the\n\nKingwood project if petitioner developed, marketed and sold the residential lots.\n\nClassic Contractors agreed to split with petitioner the net profit.\n\n      Classic Contractors obtained financing to purchase an undeveloped tract of\n\nland. Petitioner then developed and subdivided the real property into\n\napproximately 250 residential lots. Petitioner sold about 50 lots but was unable to\n\nsell the remainder. Classic Contractors eventually defaulted on the note, and the\n\nlender took title of the remaining lots. The Kingwood project thus was\n\nunprofitable.\n\n      Petitioner was not owed any money related to the Kingwood project. Nor\n\ndid petitioner ever attempt to collect any purported debt from Classic Contractors.\n\n      2\n          Monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar.\n\f                                         -5-\n\n[*5] II. Federal Income Tax Returns for the Years at Issue\n\n      Petitioner prepared and filed Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax\n\nReturn, for the years at issue. Petitioner used the accrual basis of accounting for\n\nthe years at issue despite being an individual.\n\n      Petitioner reported wage income from Classic Contractors of $55,000 for\n\n1996, $164,719 for 1997, $260,000 for 1998, $260,730 for 1999, $260,000 for\n\n2000 and $255,230 for 2001. Petitioner claimed he was exempt from withholding\n\non Form W-4, Employee\u2019s Withholding Allowance Certificate, he submitted to his\n\nemployer at the beginning of each year at issue.\n\n      Petitioner also reported a consulting business on Schedule C, Profit or Loss\n\nFrom Business, for the years at issue. Petitioner reported $5,491 of Schedule C\n\nincome for 1997 but no Schedule C income for the other years at issue. Nor did\n\npetitioner report the 1099 income. Petitioner claimed bad debt deductions of\n\n$41,302 for 1996, $137,500 for 1997, $215,100 for 1998, $209,000 for 1999,\n\n$183,727 for 2000 and $205,000 for 2001. Petitioner determined the uncollectible\n\namounts resulting from the Venezuelan and Kingwood projects at the end of each\n\nyear at issue.\n\n      Respondent requested information regarding the 1099 income. Petitioner\n\nclaimed that he had reported the 1099 income as income for 1995 and 1996. He\n\f                                         -6-\n\n[*6] asserted that the 1099 income Classic Contractors reported in 1997 was a\n\npayment on accounts receivable. Petitioner asserted that Classic Contractors made\n\nor would make additional payments. Respondent later requested additional\n\ninformation regarding the 1099 income. Petitioner again claimed that he had\n\nreported that income for 1995 and 1996 and the payment was posted against an\n\noutstanding balance on an account receivable.\n\n      Petitioner also provided respondent fabricated documents that purportedly\n\ncorroborated the debts. One such document was a letter purportedly issued by\n\nClassic Contractors during petitioner\u2019s incarceration and before his employment\n\nwith Classic Contractors.\n\n      Respondent\u2019s criminal investigation unit (CIU) reviewed the returns\n\npetitioner filed. Petitioner provided documents during a voluntary interview.\n\nEach document showed purported net operating losses (NOLs) petitioner carried\n\nforward and the purported bad debt that petitioner wrote off each year. CIU\n\nrecommended that the United States criminally prosecute petitioner.\n\nIII. Petitioner\u2019s Conviction for Filing a False Tax Return\n\n      The United States indicted petitioner for filing fraudulent returns and\n\nproviding materially false documentation for 1998, 1999 and 2000. Petitioner\n\nagreed to plead guilty to filing a false Federal income return for 2000.\n\f                                          -7-\n\n[*7] Petitioner entered into a plea agreement acknowledging that he had never\n\nreported income from Classic Contractors and that he was not entitled to any bad\n\ndebt deduction. The parties agreed that petitioner had an \u201cunused, available, and\n\npartially offsetting [$102,108] net operating loss deduction\u201d for 2000 (2000 NOL)\n\nresulting in a $19,603 tax liability. Petitioner agreed, however, that the stated tax\n\nliability was only for criminal prosecution purposes and did not resolve his civil\n\ntax liabilities. The plea agreement \u201cexpressly exclude[d] and reserve[d] for\n\nsubsequent civil proceedings the determination of any tax, interest or penalties\n\ndue.\u201d\n\nIV. Deficiency Notice\n\n        Respondent issued petitioner the deficiency notice disallowing the bad debt\n\ndeductions and determining that petitioner failed to report self-employment\n\nincome for 1996, 19973 and 1998. Respondent also determining that the civil\n\nfraud penalties applied against petitioner for the years at issue.\n\n        Respondent attached to the deficiency notice a statement of income tax\n\nchanges and a six-page explanation of examination changes with five exhibits\n\n\n        3\n      Respondent determined that petitioner did not report self-employment\nincome of $31,682 for 1997. This amount represents the $37,173 Classic\nContractors reported on the Form 1099-MISC as paid to petitioner less $5,491 in\nSchedule C income petitioner reported for 1997.\n\f                                          -8-\n\n[*8] (explanation). Respondent detailed in the explanation the reason for each\n\nadjustment.\n\n      Petitioner filed the petition contesting all determinations in the deficiency\n\nnotice.\n\n                                      OPINION\n\n      We are presented with an individual taxpayer that used the accrual method\n\nof accounting to offset wage income with purported bad debts. We must decide\n\nwhether respondent correctly disallowed the bad debt deductions and determined\n\npetitioner did not report income. We also address a series of procedural\n\nchallenges petitioner raises. We then consider whether respondent demonstrated\n\nby clear and convincing evidence that petitioner acted with intent to evade tax\n\nsuch that he is liable for the fraud penalty.\n\nI. Burden of Proof Generally\n\n      We begin with the burden of proof. The Commissioner\u2019s determinations in\n\na deficiency notice are presumed correct, and the taxpayer bears the burden of\n\nproving otherwise. Rule 142(a); Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115 (1933).\n\nDeductions are generally a matter of legislative grace, and the taxpayer bears the\n\nburden of proving he or she is entitled to claimed deductions. INDOPCO, Inc. v.\n\nCommissioner, 503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992); New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292\n\f                                          -9-\n\n[*9] U.S. 435, 440 (1934). Petitioner likewise carries the burden of substantiation.\n\nHradesky v. Commissioner, 65 T.C. 87, 90 (1975), aff\u2019d per curiam, 540 F.2d 821\n\n(5th Cir. 1976). A taxpayer must substantiate amounts claimed as deductions by\n\nmaintaining the records necessary to establish that he or she is entitled to the\n\ndeductions. Sec. 6001; Hradesky v. Commissioner, 65 T.C. at 90. The Court need\n\nnot accept a taxpayer\u2019s self-serving testimony when the taxpayer fails to present\n\ncorroborative evidence. Beam v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990-304 (citing\n\nTokarski v. Commissioner, 87 T.C. 74, 77 (1986)), aff\u2019d without published\n\nopinion, 956 F.2d 1166 (9th Cir. 1992).\n\n      The burden may shift to the Commissioner if the taxpayer proves that he or\n\nshe has satisfied certain conditions. Sec. 7491(a); Snyder v. Commissioner, T.C.\n\nMemo. 2001-255. Petitioner has not complied with the substantiation\n\nrequirements of section 7491(a). See Higbee v. Commissioner, 116 T.C. 438\n\n(2001). Nor has petitioner cooperated in this matter such that the burden of\n\nproduction would shift to respondent to produce information. See sec. 6201(d).\n\nThe burden therefore does not shift to respondent under section 7491(a).\n\nII. Bad Debt Deductions\n\n      We turn now to the bad debt deductions petitioner claimed. Respondent\n\ncontends that petitioner failed to show a bona fide debt existed that became\n\f                                        -10-\n\n[*10] worthless during each year for which petitioner claimed the deduction.\n\nPetitioner contends the 2000 NOL establishes that he had available net operating\n\nlosses from earlier years.\n\n      A. Bad Debt\n\n      We first consider whether the bad debt deductions petitioner claimed\n\nsatisfy section 166. Petitioner contends that he correctly deducted debts Classic\n\nContractors and Seaboard purportedly owed to him. Respondent asserts that\n\npetitioner has not demonstrated that he met the requirements for any deduction\n\nunder section 166. We agree.\n\n      A taxpayer may deduct any bona fide business debt that becomes worthless\n\nwithin a taxable year. Sec. 166(a)(1). An accrual method taxpayer may deduct\n\nreceivables as bad debts to the extent that the taxpayer included those amounts in\n\nincome for that year or a prior year. Sec. 1.166-1(c), Income Tax Regs. Likewise,\n\na worthless debt arising from unpaid wages, fees or similar item of taxable income\n\nis not deductible as a bad debt unless the taxpayer has included the amount in\n\nincome for the year for which the bad debt is deducted or for a prior tax year.\n\nSchnell v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2006-147.\n\n      Petitioner\u2019s contention that he included income, as an individual, for prior\n\nyears under the accrual method is absurd. Petitioner never included in income the\n\f                                        -11-\n\n[*11] purported profits from the Venezuelan project or the Kingwood project. See\n\nid. Nor did petitioner show a debt existed.4 A bona fide debt arises from a\n\ndebtor-creditor relationship based upon a valid and enforceable obligation to pay a\n\nfixed or determinable sum of money. Kean v. Commissioner, 91 T.C. 575, 594\n\n(1988); sec. 1.166-1(c), Income Tax Regs. There is no support that Seaboard or\n\nClassic Contractors was indebted to petitioner or a debtor-creditor relationship\n\nexisted. Seaboard and Classic Contractors, not petitioner, each realized a loss\n\nfrom the unsuccessful ventures.\n\n      Petitioner also failed to demonstrate the purported debts became worthless\n\nduring the years at issue. A taxpayer must prove that the debt had value at the\n\nbeginning of the year in which it allegedly became worthless and that it became\n\nworthless during that year. Estate of Mann v. United States, 731 F.2d 267, 275\n\n(5th Cir. 1984); Am. Offshore, Inc. v. Commissioner, 97 T.C. 579, 593-594\n\n(1991). Petitioner testified that he determined the amount of debt that became\n\n\n      4\n       Petitioner provided carbon copies of checks that he claims demonstrate the\nexistence of bad debts but failed to submit any corresponding receipts or bank\nstatements. The checks do not substantiate the existence of bad debts. See Miller\nv. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1996-402 (carbon copies of checks without\ncorroborating bank statements did not meet substantiation requirements); Burrell\nv. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1994-574 (carbon copies of uncanceled checks and\nself-made receipts did not meet substantiation requirements).\n\f                                        -12-\n\n[*12] worthless each year. Petitioner provided no credible documentation,\n\nhowever, corroborating his assertion. Nor did petitioner ever attempt to collect\n\nany of the purported debt. We therefore find that petitioner failed to establish\n\nthere was any debt for section 166 purposes.\n\n      B. Collateral Estoppel\n\n      We now consider whether the 2000 NOL described in the plea agreement\n\nprecludes respondent from challenging certain bad debt deductions. Petitioner\n\nasserts that the 2000 NOL establishes the purported debt and precludes respondent\n\nfrom challenging the bad debt deductions for 1996 through 1999. Respondent\n\ncounters that he is not precluded because the 2000 NOL5 was not an essential fact\n\nactually litigated in the prior proceeding. We agree with respondent.\n\n      Collateral estoppel may preclude a party from litigating previously decided\n\nissues of fact or law necessary to a court\u2019s prior judgment. Commissioner v.\n\nSunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 598 (1948); Meier v. Commissioner, 91 T.C. 273, 286\n\n(1988). Collateral estoppel applies only when the parties actually litigated the\n\n      5\n        We note that petitioner never demonstrated an available NOL. Rather,\npetitioner asserted at trial that the plea agreement established the 2000 NOL and\nprecluded respondent from denying petitioner an NOL available for earlier years.\nThe burden nonetheless rested with petitioner to demonstrate that he was entitled\nto NOL deductions. Petitioner acknowledged at trial that he was not attempting to\nreconstruct the NOL. Nor does the record establish petitioner was entitled to\nclaim any NOL deductions.\n\f                                         -13-\n\n[*13] issue and resolving that issue was essential to the prior decision.6 Peck v.\n\nCommissioner, 90 T.C. 162, 166-167 (1988), aff\u2019d, 904 F.2d 525 (9th Cir. 1990).\n\nA fact stated in a plea agreement is not established unless that fact was a necessary\n\nelement for conviction. Uscinski v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2006-200.\n\n      The plea agreement does not preclude respondent from challenging the bad\n\ndebt deductions. Petitioner pleaded guilty to filing a false individual tax return for\n\n2000. This establishes an underpayment for that year. See sec. 7206(1); Laciny v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2013-107. The 2000 NOL was not a necessary\n\nelement, however, of that crime. The material fact that constituted the false\n\nstatement was the bad debt deduction petitioner claimed. The 2000 NOL was\n\nrelevant to the tax loss for criminal sentencing purposes. And petitioner agreed\n\nthat the plea agreement did not resolve his civil tax liability. Collateral estoppel\n\ndoes not preclude respondent\u2019s determination.\n\nIII. 1099 Income\n\n      We next consider whether respondent correctly determined that petitioner\n\nfailed to report the 1099 income. Petitioner asserts that the Forms 1099-MISC\n\nalone are insufficient for respondent to determine petitioner had unreported\n\n      6\n       Certain conditions must also be met for collateral estoppel to apply. See\ngenerally Peck v. Commissioner, 90 T.C. 162, 166-167 (1988), aff\u2019d, 904 F.2d 525\n(9th Cir. 1990). We need not address the other elements.\n\f                                        -14-\n\n[*14] income. See Portillo v. Commissioner, 932 F.2d 1128, 1134 (5th Cir. 1991),\n\naff\u2019g in part, rev\u2019g in part T.C. Memo. 1990-68. Respondent counters that the\n\ndetermination is factually supported because petitioner acknowledged that he\n\nreceived the 1099 income. See Petzoldt v. Commissioner, 92 T.C. 661, 687-688\n\n(1989); Fankhanel v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1998-403, aff\u2019d without\n\npublished opinion, 205 F.3d 1333 (4th Cir. 2000). We agree with respondent.\n\n      Petitioner disputes the income\u2019s characterization, not his receipt of it. The\n\nrecord demonstrates that petitioner acknowledged during examination receiving\n\nthe 1099 income. He claimed that he reported the 1099 income for an earlier year\n\nas repayment of indebtedness from Classic Contractors. We have already rejected\n\npetitioner\u2019s assertion that Classic Contractors was indebted to him and that he\n\npreviously reported the income. Petitioner\u2019s admission that he received the\n\nincome supports respondent\u2019s determination with respect to the 1099 income.\n\nPetitioner has not demonstrated the determination is incorrect. See Petzoldt v.\n\nCommissioner, 92 T.C. at 689; see also Hardy v. Commissioner, 181 F.3d 1002,\n\n1004 (9th Cir. 1999), aff\u2019g T.C. Memo. 1997-97. We therefore sustain\n\nrespondent\u2019s determination that petitioner had unreported income.\n\f                                        -15-\n\n[*15] IV. Procedural Challenges to Respondent\u2019s Determinations\n\n      Petitioner throws a variety of procedural challenges at the deficiency\n\ndetermination. We address each argument in turn.\n\n      A. Adequacy of Deficiency Notice\n\n      Petitioner first suggests, without any particularity, that the deficiency notice\n\nfails to describe the basis for the adjustments. See sec. 7522. We disagree. The\n\ndeficiency notice identifies the amounts, the tax years and the reasons for the\n\nadjustments. See Health Inv. Corp. v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-211. And\n\nrespondent explained the reason for each adjustment7 in the explanation. We hold\n\nthat the deficiency notice comports with the requirements of section 7522.\n\n      B. Multiple Examinations\n\n      We next consider petitioner\u2019s assertion that respondent improperly\n\nexamined returns for certain years multiple times. Petitioner contends respondent\n\nwas obligated to issue second examination notices before doing so. See sec.\n\n7605(b). Respondent denies conducting multiple examinations. We agree with\n\nrespondent.\n\n\n      7\n       Petitioner also argues that respondent did not adequately explain why he\nallowed petitioner a short-term capital loss of $3,000 for each year at issue.\nPetitioner claims that respondent was required to \u201cdescribe the source\u201d of the\nlosses. Petitioner, however, does not challenge this adjustment.\n\f                                        -16-\n\n[*16] The Commissioner may review matching information on a tax return with\n\nother records or information in his possession. Id.; see Ellis v. Commissioner,\n\nT.C. Memo. 2007-207, aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 346 Fed. Appx. 346 (10th Cir.\n\n2009); Rev. Proc. 2005-32, sec. 4.03(1)(b), 2005-1 C.B. 1206, 1207. A taxpayer\u2019s\n\nvoluntary provision of information to the Commissioner regarding a return is not\n\nconsidered an examination. See Rev. Proc. 2005-32, sec. 4.03(1)(c). The record\n\ndemonstrates that petitioner provided information during a voluntary interview\n\nwith CIU. See Ballantine v. Commissioner, 74 T.C. 516, 524 (1980); Rose v.\n\nCommissioner, 70 T.C. 558, 560 (1978). We therefore find that respondent was\n\nnot obligated to issue a notice of second examination.\n\nV. Fraudulent Intent\n\n      We now consider whether respondent demonstrated by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that petitioner acted with fraudulent intent. We do so to decide whether\n\npetitioner is liable for the civil fraud penalty under section 6663 and whether the\n\nlimitations period under section 6501(c) bars respondent\u2019s determinations. We\n\naddress each in turn.\n\n      A. Fraud Penalty\n\n      We now consider whether petitioner is liable for the fraud penalty under\n\nsection 6663. The Commissioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence\n\f                                        -17-\n\n[*17] that the taxpayer underpaid his or her income tax and that some part of the\n\nunderpayment was due to fraud. Secs. 7454(a), 6663(a); Rule 142(b); Clayton v.\n\nCommissioner, 102 T.C. 632, 646 (1994). Fraud is a factual question to be\n\ndecided on the entire record and cannot be presumed. Rowlee v. Commissioner,\n\n80 T.C. 1111, 1123 (1983); Beaver v. Commissioner, 55 T.C. 85, 92 (1970). For\n\neach tax year, respondent must establish fraud through independent evidence. See\n\nDaoud v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-282, aff\u2019d, ___ Fed. Appx. ____, 2013\n\nWL 6405826 (9th Cir. Dec. 9, 2013).\n\n             1. Badges of Fraud\n\n      The Commissioner must show that the taxpayer acted with specific intent to\n\nevade tax that the taxpayer knew or believed he or she owed by conduct intended\n\nto conceal, mislead or otherwise prevent the collection of tax. Sec. 7454; Recklitis\n\nv. Commissioner, 91 T.C. 874, 909 (1988); Stephenson v. Commissioner, 79 T.C.\n\n995, 1005 (1982), aff\u2019d, 748 F.2d 331 (6th Cir. 1984). Direct evidence of fraud is\n\nseldom available, and its existence may therefore be determined from the\n\ntaxpayer\u2019s conduct and the surrounding circumstances. Stone v. Commissioner,\n\n56 T.C. 213, 223-224 (1971).\n\n      Courts rely on several indicia or badges of fraud. These badges of fraud\n\ninclude understatement of income, inadequate records, failure to file tax returns,\n\f                                         -18-\n\n[*18] concealment of assets, failure to cooperate with tax authorities, filing false\n\ndocuments, failure to make estimated tax payments, engaging in illegal activity,\n\nattempting to conceal illegal activity, dealing in cash, implausible or inconsistent\n\nexplanations of behavior, an intent to mislead that may be inferred from a pattern\n\nof conduct, and lack of credibility of the taxpayer\u2019s testimony. Spies v. United\n\nStates, 317 U.S. 492, 499 (1943); Bradford v. Commissioner, 796 F.2d 303,\n\n307-308 (9th Cir. 1986), aff\u2019g T.C. Memo. 1984-601. Although no single factor is\n\nnecessarily sufficient to establish fraud, a combination of several of these factors\n\nmay be persuasive evidence of fraud. Solomon v. Commissioner, 732 F.2d 1459,\n\n1461 (6th Cir. 1984), aff\u2019g per curiam T.C. Memo. 1982-603.\n\n                    a. Understatement of Income\n\n      Petitioner consistently understated his income for each year at issue. The\n\nunderstatement of income can be shown by an overstatement of deductions. See\n\nDaoud v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-282. Petitioner claimed bad debt\n\ndeductions that he was unable to substantiate. The deduction amounts\n\ncorresponded with his reported income to offset most or all of his liability for each\n\nyear. Petitioner also failed to report 1099 income.\n\f                                          -19-\n\n[*19]                b. Inadequate and Incomplete Records\n\n        Petitioner\u2019s inadequate and incomplete records failed to substantiate any\n\nbad debt deductions for the years at issue. There was no credible documentation\n\nconfirming that petitioner held debt, that the debt ever became worthless or that\n\nthe debt became worthless the year he claimed.\n\n                     c. Failure To Cooperate\n\n        Petitioner also did not cooperate with respondent. Respondent repeatedly\n\nsought additional information regarding the years at issue. Petitioner made false\n\nstatements and produced misleading or fabricated documents purportedly\n\nsubstantiating the claimed deductions.\n\n                     d. Engaging in and Concealing Illegal Conduct\n\n        Petitioner engaged in illegal conduct as he pleaded guilty to filing a false\n\nFederal income tax return for 2000. A conviction under section 7206(1) is highly\n\npersuasive evidence that a taxpayer intended to evade tax for that year. See Morse\n\nv. Commissioner, 419 F.3d 829, 833 (8th Cir. 2005), aff\u2019g T.C. Memo. 2003-332;\n\nStefansson v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1994-162; Avery v. Commissioner, T.C.\n\nMemo. 1993-344; Miller v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1989-461. Petitioner\n\nacknowledged in the plea agreement that there was no bona fide debt and that he\n\nwas not entitled to the bad debt deduction. This purported debt was the same that\n\f                                          -20-\n\n[*20] he determined became worthless and claimed as deductions for the other\n\nyears at issue. Further, petitioner attempted to conceal his illegal activity from\n\nrespondent by providing fabricated documents and misleading information.\n\n                   e. Inconsistent Explanations and Incredible Testimony\n\n      Petitioner provided inconsistent explanations that demonstrate an intent to\n\nmislead respondent. Respondent examined bad debt deductions petitioner claimed\n\nfor multiple years. Petitioner repeatedly asserted that he was entitled to the\n\ndeductions. He claimed that he reported the 1099 income in an earlier year when\n\nhe had in fact not reported the income.\n\n      Petitioner\u2019s testimony lacked credibility. He continued to assert that\n\nSeaboard and Classic Contractors were indebted to him. The record consistently\n\ncontradicted his testimony.\n\n                   f. Tax Expertise\n\n      Petitioner\u2019s experience and understanding of tax law support a finding that\n\nhe acted with fraudulent intent. See Scallen v. Commissioner, 877 F.2d 1364,\n\n1370-1371 (8th Cir. 1989), aff\u2019g T.C. Memo. 1987-412. A taxpayer\u2019s\n\nintelligence, education and sophistication are relevant in determining fraudulent\n\nintent. Scott v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2012-65; Wright v. Commissioner;\n\nT.C. Memo. 2000-336. Petitioner was a sophisticated and savvy businessman. He\n\f                                          -21-\n\n[*21] had worked as a bookkeeper and accountant. Petitioner independently\n\nresearched tax issues. We find that petitioner understood his conduct was contrary\n\nto existing tax law.\n\n                       g. Badges of Fraud Conclusion\n\n         In toto, many badges of fraud apply to petitioner. We conclude that\n\nrespondent has proven by clear and convincing evidence that there was an\n\nunderpayment for each year at issue and each underpayment was attributable to\n\nfraud.\n\n               2. Petitioner\u2019s Burden\n\n         Once the Commissioner has established by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat any portion of an underpayment is attributable to fraud, the entire\n\nunderpayment shall be treated as attributable to fraud, except with respect to any\n\nportion of the underpayment that the taxpayer establishes (by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence) is not attributable to fraud. Sec. 6663(b); see Foxworthy, Inc. v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2009-203, aff\u2019d, 494 Fed. Appx. 964 (11th Cir. 2012).\n\n         Petitioner asserts that he misunderstood the requirements to claim the bad\n\ndebt deductions because his tax professional advised him to use the accrual\n\nmethod of accounting. Respondent contends that petitioner failed to show that any\n\nportion was not attributable to fraud. We agree with respondent.\n\f                                        -22-\n\n[*22] Petitioner contends he relied on a tax professional\u2019s advice. Petitioner\n\nfailed to corroborate, however, that he received the advice he claims he did. The\n\ntax professional did not testify. And petitioner did not offer any evidence\n\ncorroborating his assertions.\n\n      Further, petitioner has not explained how advice purportedly given in the\n\n1970s informed him on whether he could claim bad debt deductions arising in the\n\n1990s. There is no indication that a tax professional reviewed relevant documents\n\nand advised petitioner on the years at issue. Rather, petitioner had a strong\n\nunderstanding of tax law and prepared returns for himself and his former\n\nemployers. His assertions are incredible, illogical and entirely unbelievable. The\n\nrecord demonstrates that petitioner consistently misled respondent and\n\nintentionally confused issues to avoid his tax obligations. Petitioner failed to\n\ndemonstrate that any portion of the income was not attributable to fraud.\n\n      Accordingly, we find that petitioner is liable for the fraud penalty under\n\nsection 6663 for each year at issue.8\n\n\n\n\n      8\n        Respondent alternatively requested we impose an accuracy-related penalty\nunder sec. 6662. In light of our fraud finding, we need not consider the accuracy-\nrelated penalty.\n\f                                        -23-\n\n[*23] B. Statute of Limitations\n\n      Petitioner also argues that the limitations periods expired before respondent\n\nassessed petitioner\u2019s tax for the years at issue. Respondent contends that the\n\nlimitations period does not apply for the years at issue because petitioner acted\n\nwith the intent to evade tax. We agree with respondent.\n\n      The Commissioner must generally make such an assessment within a\n\nthree-year period after a taxpayer files his or her return. Sec. 6501(a). In the case\n\nof a false and fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax, however, the tax may\n\nbe assessed at any time. Sec. 6501(c)(1).\n\n      We have found that petitioner is liable for the fraud penalty under section\n\n6663 for all years at issue. Respondent\u2019s burden of proof under section 6501(c)(1)\n\nis the same as that imposed under section 6663. See Browning v. Commissioner,\n\nT.C. Memo. 2011-261. We therefore hold that the limitations periods for\n\nassessing petitioner\u2019s tax are extended indefinitely. See sec. 6501(c)(1); Paterson\n\nv. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2007-109. Accordingly, respondent is not barred\n\nfrom assessing petitioner\u2019s deficiency for any year at issue. See sec. 6501(c)(1).\n\f                                          -24-\n\n[*24] VI. Conclusion\n\n         We sustain respondent\u2019s deficiency determinations for the years at issue,\n\nincluding the fraud penalty under section 6663.\n\n         In reaching these holdings, we have considered all arguments, and, to the\n\nextent not addressed here, we conclude that they are moot, irrelevant or without\n\nmerit.\n\n         To reflect the foregoing,\n\n\n\n                                                       Decision will be entered for\n\n                                                 respondent.\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                   T.C.

We must decide\n\nwhether petitioner was entitled to deductions under section 1661 for purported bad\n\n\n      1\n          All section references are to the Internal Revenue Code for the years at\n                                                                         (continued...)\n\f                                         -2-\n\n[*2] debts associated with a purported consulting activity that offset wage income.\n\nWe hold that petitioner was not. We must also decide whether petitioner failed to\n\nreport certain income for 1996, 1997 and 1998. We hold that he did not report\n\nthat income. We must also decide whether petitioner is liable for the fraud penalty\n\nunder section 6663. We hold that petitioner is liable.\n\n                               FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      The parties have stipulated some facts. We incorporate the stipulation of\n\nfacts and accompanying exhibits by this reference. Petitioner resided in Texas\n\nwhen he filed the petition.\n\nI. Petitioner\u2019s Employment and Dealings\n\n      A. Petitioner\u2019s Background\n\n      Petitioner is an experienced and savvy businessman. Petitioner earned a\n\nbusiness administration degree from the University of Houston in 1975. In the\n\n1980s petitioner organized various business entities engaged in residential real\n\nestate projects. Petitioner then worked as a salaried employee for the better part of\n\nthe next decade.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        (...continued)\nissue, and all Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and\nProcedure, unless otherwise indicated.\n\f                                         -3-\n\n[*3] B. Seaboard Controls\n\n      Petitioner served as bookkeeper for Seaboard Controls (Seaboard) from\n\n1992 to March 1994 and prepared its Federal income tax returns.\n\n      Seaboard was involved in a project for the Venezuelan Government\n\n(Venezuelan project). To that end, Seaboard tasked petitioner with obtaining\n\nfinancing on Seaboard\u2019s behalf. Petitioner was unsuccessful, and Seaboard\n\nultimately lost money on the Venezuelan project.\n\n      Seaboard never had a profit-sharing agreement with petitioner relating to\n\nthe Venezuelan project. Petitioner never requested Seaboard to satisfy any\n\npurported debt.\n\n      C. Bank Fraud Incarceration\n\n      Petitioner was incarcerated from April 1994 to December 1995 for a Federal\n\nbank fraud conviction. Petitioner was not employed, nor did he earn income\n\nduring his incarceration.\n\n      D. Houston Drywall\n\n      Houston Drywall, Inc. (Houston Drywall), d.b.a. Classic Contractors of\n\nHouston, Inc. (Classic Contractors), hired petitioner as a salesman after his\n\nincarceration. Houston Drywall paid petitioner wages during each year at issue.\n\f                                          -4-\n\n[*4] Petitioner also prepared Federal tax returns for Classic Contractors for 1998\n\nthrough 2001.\n\n      Classic Contractors paid petitioner an additional $28,8172 in 1996, $37,173\n\nin 1997 and $9,400 in 1998. Classic Contractors filed Forms 1099-MISC,\n\nMiscellaneous Income, for those years (1099 income).\n\n      E. Kingwood Project\n\n      Petitioner proposed a residential real estate project in Kingwood, Texas\n\n(Kingwood project). Classic Contractors agreed to purchase a tract of land for the\n\nKingwood project if petitioner developed, marketed and sold the residential lots.\n\nClassic Contractors agreed to split with petitioner the net profit.\n\n      Classic Contractors obtained financing to purchase an undeveloped tract of\n\nland. Petitioner then developed and subdivided the real property into\n\napproximately 250 residential lots. Petitioner sold about 50 lots but was unable to\n\nsell the remainder. Classic Contractors eventually defaulted on the note, and the\n\nlender took title of the remaining lots. The Kingwood project thus was\n\nunprofitable.\n\n      Petitioner was not owed any money related to the Kingwood project. Nor\n\ndid petitioner ever attempt to collect any purported debt from Classic Contractors.\n\n      2\n          Monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest dollar.\n\f                                         -5-\n\n[*5] II. Federal Income Tax Returns for the Years at Issue\n\n      Petitioner prepared and filed Forms 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax\n\nReturn, for the years at issue. Petitioner used the accrual basis of accounting for\n\nthe years at issue despite being an individual.\n\n      Petitioner reported wage income from Classic Contractors of $55,000 for\n\n1996, $164,719 for 1997, $260,000 for 1998, $260,730 for 1999, $260,000 for\n\n2000 and $255,230 for 2001. Petitioner claimed he was exempt from withholding\n\non Form W-4, Employee\u2019s Withholding Allowance Certificate, he submitted to his\n\nemployer at the beginning of each year at issue.\n\n      Petitioner also reported a consulting business on Schedule C, Profit or Loss\n\nFrom Business, for the years at issue. Petitioner reported $5,491 of Schedule C\n\nincome for 1997 but no Schedule C income for the other years at issue. Nor did\n\npetitioner report the 1099 income. Petitioner claimed bad debt deductions of\n\n$41,302 for 1996, $137,500 for 1997, $215,100 for 1998, $209,000 for 1999,\n\n$183,727 for 2000 and $205,000 for 2001. Petitioner determined the uncollectible\n\namounts resulting from the Venezuelan and Kingwood projects at the end of each\n\nyear at issue.\n\n      Respondent requested information regarding the 1099 income. Petitioner\n\nclaimed that he had reported the 1099 income as income for 1995 and 1996. He\n\f                                         -6-\n\n[*6] asserted that the 1099 income Classic Contractors reported in 1997 was a\n\npayment on accounts receivable. Petitioner asserted that Classic Contractors made\n\nor would make additional payments. Respondent later requested additional\n\ninformation regarding the 1099 income. Petitioner again claimed that he had\n\nreported that income for 1995 and 1996 and the payment was posted against an\n\noutstanding balance on an account receivable.\n\n      Petitioner also provided respondent fabricated documents that purportedly\n\ncorroborated the debts. One such document was a letter purportedly issued by\n\nClassic Contractors during petitioner\u2019s incarceration and before his employment\n\nwith Classic Contractors.\n\n      Respondent\u2019s criminal investigation unit (CIU) reviewed the returns\n\npetitioner filed. Petitioner provided documents during a voluntary interview.\n\nEach document showed purported net operating losses (NOLs) petitioner carried\n\nforward and the purported bad debt that petitioner wrote off each year. CIU\n\nrecommended that the United States criminally prosecute petitioner.\n\nIII. Petitioner\u2019s Conviction for Filing a False Tax Return\n\n      The United States indicted petitioner for filing fraudulent returns and\n\nproviding materially false documentation for 1998, 1999 and 2000. Petitioner\n\nagreed to plead guilty to filing a false Federal income return for 2000.\n\f                                          -7-\n\n[*7] Petitioner entered into a plea agreement acknowledging that he had never\n\nreported income from Classic Contractors and that he was not entitled to any bad\n\ndebt deduction. The parties agreed that petitioner had an \u201cunused, available, and\n\npartially offsetting [$102,108] net operating loss deduction\u201d for 2000 (2000 NOL)\n\nresulting in a $19,603 tax liability. Petitioner agreed, however, that the stated tax\n\nliability was only for criminal prosecution purposes and did not resolve his civil\n\ntax liabilities. The plea agreement \u201cexpressly exclude[d] and reserve[d] for\n\nsubsequent civil proceedings the determination of any tax, interest or penalties\n\ndue.\u201d\n\nIV. Deficiency Notice\n\n        Respondent issued petitioner the deficiency notice disallowing the bad debt\n\ndeductions and determining that petitioner failed to report self-employment\n\nincome for 1996, 19973 and 1998. Respondent also determining that the civil\n\nfraud penalties applied against petitioner for the years at issue.\n\n        Respondent attached to the deficiency notice a statement of income tax\n\nchanges and a six-page explanation of examination changes with five exhibits\n\n\n        3\n      Respondent determined that petitioner did not report self-employment\nincome of $31,682 for 1997. This amount represents the $37,173 Classic\nContractors reported on the Form 1099-MISC as paid to petitioner less $5,491 in\nSchedule C income petitioner reported for 1997.\n\f                                          -8-\n\n[*8] (explanation). Respondent detailed in the explanation the reason for each\n\nadjustment.\n\n      Petitioner filed the petition contesting all determinations in the deficiency\n\nnotice.\n\n                                      OPINION\n\n      We are presented with an individual taxpayer that used the accrual method\n\nof accounting to offset wage income with purported bad debts. We must decide\n\nwhether respondent correctly disallowed the bad debt deductions and determined\n\npetitioner did not report income. We also address a series of procedural\n\nchallenges petitioner raises. We then consider whether respondent demonstrated\n\nby clear and convincing evidence that petitioner acted with intent to evade tax\n\nsuch that he is liable for the fraud penalty.\n\nI. Burden of Proof Generally\n\n      We begin with the burden of proof. The Commissioner\u2019s determinations in\n\na deficiency notice are presumed correct, and the taxpayer bears the burden of\n\nproving otherwise. Rule 142(a); Welch v. Helvering, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102139\"><a href=\"/opinion/102139/welch-v-helvering/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 (1933).\n\nDeductions are generally a matter of legislative grace, and the taxpayer bears the\n\nburden of proving he or she is entitled to claimed deductions. INDOPCO, Inc. v.\n\nCommissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112697\"><a href=\"/opinion/112697/indopco-inc-v-commissioner/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (1992); New Colonial Ice Co. v. Helvering, 292\n\f                                          -9-\n\n[*9] U.S. 435, 440 (1934). Petitioner likewise carries the burden of substantiation.\n\nHradesky v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90 (1975), aff\u2019d per curiam, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"338538\"><a href=\"/opinion/338538/frank-j-hradesky-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(5th Cir. 1976). A taxpayer must substantiate amounts claimed as deductions by\n\nmaintaining the records necessary to establish that he or she is entitled to the\n\ndeductions. Sec. 6001; Hradesky v. Commissioner, 65 T.C. at 90. The Court need\n\nnot accept a taxpayer\u2019s self-serving testimony when the taxpayer fails to present\n\ncorroborative evidence. Beam v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1990-304 (citing\n\nTokarski v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (1986)), aff\u2019d without published\n\nopinion, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1992).\n\n      The burden may shift to the Commissioner if the taxpayer proves that he or\n\nshe has satisfied certain conditions. Sec. 7491(a); Snyder v. Commissioner, T.C.\n\nMemo. 2001-255. Petitioner has not complied with the substantiation\n\nrequirements of section 7491(a). See Higbee v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2001). Nor has petitioner cooperated in this matter such that the burden of\n\nproduction would shift to respondent to produce information. See sec. 6201(d).\n\nThe burden therefore does not shift to respondent under section 7491(a).\n\nII. Bad Debt Deductions\n\n      We turn now to the bad debt deductions petitioner claimed. Respondent\n\ncontends that petitioner failed to show a bona fide debt existed that became\n\f                                        -10-\n\n[*10] worthless during each year for which petitioner claimed the deduction.\n\nPetitioner contends the 2000 NOL establishes that he had available net operating\n\nlosses from earlier years.\n\n      A. Bad Debt\n\n      We first consider whether the bad debt deductions petitioner claimed\n\nsatisfy section 166. Petitioner contends that he correctly deducted debts Classic\n\nContractors and Seaboard purportedly owed to him. Respondent asserts that\n\npetitioner has not demonstrated that he met the requirements for any deduction\n\nunder section 166. We agree.\n\n      A taxpayer may deduct any bona fide business debt that becomes worthless\n\nwithin a taxable year. Sec. 166(a)(1). An accrual method taxpayer may deduct\n\nreceivables as bad debts to the extent that the taxpayer included those amounts in\n\nincome for that year or a prior year. Sec. 1.166-1(c), Income Tax Regs. Likewise,\n\na worthless debt arising from unpaid wages, fees or similar item of taxable income\n\nis not deductible as a bad debt unless the taxpayer has included the amount in\n\nincome for the year for which the bad debt is deducted or for a prior tax year.\n\nSchnell v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2006-147.\n\n      Petitioner\u2019s contention that he included income, as an individual, for prior\n\nyears under the accrual method is absurd. Petitioner never included in income the\n\f                                        -11-\n\n[*11] purported profits from the Venezuelan project or the Kingwood project. See\n\nid. Nor did petitioner show a debt existed.4 A bona fide debt arises from a\n\ndebtor-creditor relationship based upon a valid and enforceable obligation to pay a\n\nfixed or determinable sum of money. Kean v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594\n\n(1988); sec. 1.166-1(c), Income Tax Regs. There is no support that Seaboard or\n\nClassic Contractors was indebted to petitioner or a debtor-creditor relationship\n\nexisted. Seaboard and Classic Contractors, not petitioner, each realized a loss\n\nfrom the unsuccessful ventures.\n\n      Petitioner also failed to demonstrate the purported debts became worthless\n\nduring the years at issue. A taxpayer must prove that the debt had value at the\n\nbeginning of the year in which it allegedly became worthless and that it became\n\nworthless during that year. Estate of Mann v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433554\"><a href=\"/opinion/433554/estate-of-guy-l-mann-deceased-suzanne-mann-duval-administratrix-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275\n\n(5th Cir. 1984); Am. Offshore, Inc. v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593-594\n\n(1991). Petitioner testified that he determined the amount of debt that became\n\n\n      4\n       Petitioner provided carbon copies of checks that he claims demonstrate the\nexistence of bad debts but failed to submit any corresponding receipts or bank\nstatements. The checks do not substantiate the existence of bad debts. See Miller\nv. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1996-402 (carbon copies of checks without\ncorroborating bank statements did not meet substantiation requirements); Burrell\nv. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1994-574 (carbon copies of uncanceled checks and\nself-made receipts did not meet substantiation requirements).\n\f                                        -12-\n\n[*12] worthless each year. Petitioner provided no credible documentation,\n\nhowever, corroborating his assertion. Nor did petitioner ever attempt to collect\n\nany of the purported debt. We therefore find that petitioner failed to establish\n\nthere was any debt for section 166 purposes.\n\n      B. Collateral Estoppel\n\n      We now consider whether the 2000 NOL described in the plea agreement\n\nprecludes respondent from challenging certain bad debt deductions. Petitioner\n\nasserts that the 2000 NOL establishes the purported debt and precludes respondent\n\nfrom challenging the bad debt deductions for 1996 through 1999. Respondent\n\ncounters that he is not precluded because the 2000 NOL5 was not an essential fact\n\nactually litigated in the prior proceeding. We agree with respondent.\n\n      Collateral estoppel may preclude a party from litigating previously decided\n\nissues of fact or law necessary to a court\u2019s prior judgment. Commissioner v.\n\nSunnen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104537\"><a href=\"/opinion/104537/commissioner-v-sunnen/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 598 (1948); Meier v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286\n\n(1988). Collateral estoppel applies only when the parties actually litigated the\n\n      5\n        We note that petitioner never demonstrated an available NOL. Rather,\npetitioner asserted at trial that the plea agreement established the 2000 NOL and\nprecluded respondent from denying petitioner an NOL available for earlier years.\nThe burden nonetheless rested with petitioner to demonstrate that he was entitled\nto NOL deductions. Petitioner acknowledged at trial that he was not attempting to\nreconstruct the NOL. Nor does the record establish petitioner was entitled to\nclaim any NOL deductions.\n\f                                         -13-\n\n[*13] issue and resolving that issue was essential to the prior decision.6 Peck v.\n\nCommissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166-167 (1988), aff\u2019d, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542382\"><a href=\"/opinion/542382/donald-a-peck-judith-w-peck-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1990).\n\nA fact stated in a plea agreement is not established unless that fact was a necessary\n\nelement for conviction. Uscinski v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2006-200.\n\n      The plea agreement does not preclude respondent from challenging the bad\n\ndebt deductions. Petitioner pleaded guilty to filing a false individual tax return for\n\n2000. This establishes an underpayment for that year. See sec. 7206(1); Laciny v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2013-107. The 2000 NOL was not a necessary\n\nelement, however, of that crime. The material fact that constituted the false\n\nstatement was the bad debt deduction petitioner claimed. The 2000 NOL was\n\nrelevant to the tax loss for criminal sentencing purposes. And petitioner agreed\n\nthat the plea agreement did not resolve his civil tax liability. Collateral estoppel\n\ndoes not preclude respondent\u2019s determination.\n\nIII. 1099 Income\n\n      We next consider whether respondent correctly determined that petitioner\n\nfailed to report the 1099 income. Petitioner asserts that the Forms 1099-MISC\n\nalone are insufficient for respondent to determine petitioner had unreported\n\n      6\n       Certain conditions must also be met for collateral estoppel to apply. See\ngenerally Peck v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166-167 (1988), aff\u2019d, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542382\"><a href=\"/opinion/542382/donald-a-peck-judith-w-peck-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(9th Cir. 1990). We need not address the other elements.\n\f                                        -14-\n\n[*14] income. See Portillo v.

We agree with respondent.\n\n      Petitioner disputes the income\u2019s characterization, not his receipt of it. The\n\nrecord demonstrates that petitioner acknowledged during examination receiving\n\nthe 1099 income. He claimed that he reported the 1099 income for an earlier year\n\nas repayment of indebtedness from Classic Contractors. We have already rejected\n\npetitioner\u2019s assertion that Classic Contractors was indebted to him and that he\n\npreviously reported the income. Petitioner\u2019s admission that he received the\n\nincome supports respondent\u2019s determination with respect to the 1099 income.\n\nPetitioner has not demonstrated the determination is incorrect. See Petzoldt v.\n\nCommissioner, 92 T.C. at 689; see also Hardy v.

Procedural Challenges to Respondent\u2019s Determinations\n\n      Petitioner throws a variety of procedural challenges at the deficiency\n\ndetermination. We address each argument in turn.\n\n      A. Adequacy of Deficiency Notice\n\n      Petitioner first suggests, without any particularity, that the deficiency notice\n\nfails to describe the basis for the adjustments. See sec. 7522. We disagree. The\n\ndeficiency notice identifies the amounts, the tax years and the reasons for the\n\nadjustments. See Health Inv. Corp. v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-211. And\n\nrespondent explained the reason for each adjustment7 in the explanation. We hold\n\nthat the deficiency notice comports with the requirements of section 7522.\n\n      B. Multiple Examinations\n\n      We next consider petitioner\u2019s assertion that respondent improperly\n\nexamined returns for certain years multiple times. Petitioner contends respondent\n\nwas obligated to issue second examination notices before doing so. See sec.\n\n7605(b). Respondent denies conducting multiple examinations. We agree with\n\nrespondent.\n\n\n      7\n       Petitioner also argues that respondent did not adequately explain why he\nallowed petitioner a short-term capital loss of $3,000 for each year at issue.\nPetitioner claims that respondent was required to \u201cdescribe the source\u201d of the\nlosses. Petitioner, however, does not challenge this adjustment.\n\f                                        -16-\n\n[*16] The Commissioner may review matching information on a tax return with\n\nother records or information in his possession. Id.; see Ellis v. Commissioner,\n\nT.C. Memo. 2007-207, aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 346 Fed. Appx. 346 (10th Cir.\n\n2009); Rev. Proc. 2005-32, sec. 4.03(1)(b), 2005-1 C.B. 1206, 1207. A taxpayer\u2019s\n\nvoluntary provision of information to the Commissioner regarding a return is not\n\nconsidered an examination. See Rev. Proc. 2005-32, sec. 4.03(1)(c). The record\n\ndemonstrates that petitioner provided information during a voluntary interview\n\nwith CIU. See Ballantine v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524 (1980); Rose v.\n\nCommissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 560 (1978). We therefore find that respondent was\n\nnot obligated to issue a notice of second examination.\n\nV. Fraudulent Intent\n\n      We now consider whether respondent demonstrated by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that petitioner acted with fraudulent intent. We do so to decide whether\n\npetitioner is liable for the civil fraud penalty under section 6663 and whether the\n\nlimitations period under section 6501(c) bars respondent\u2019s determinations. We\n\naddress each in turn.\n\n      A. Fraud Penalty\n\n      We now consider whether petitioner is liable for the fraud penalty under\n\nsection 6663. The Commissioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence\n\f                                        -17-\n\n[*17] that the taxpayer underpaid his or her income tax and that some part of the\n\nunderpayment was due to fraud.

These badges of fraud\n\ninclude understatement of income, inadequate records, failure to file tax returns,\n\f                                         -18-\n\n[*18] concealment of assets, failure to cooperate with tax authorities, filing false\n\ndocuments, failure to make estimated tax payments, engaging in illegal activity,\n\nattempting to conceal illegal activity, dealing in cash, implausible or inconsistent\n\nexplanations of behavior, an intent to mislead that may be inferred from a pattern\n\nof conduct, and lack of credibility of the taxpayer\u2019s testimony.

Memo. 1982-603.\n\n                    a. Understatement of Income\n\n      Petitioner consistently understated his income for each year at issue. The\n\nunderstatement of income can be shown by an overstatement of deductions. See\n\nDaoud v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-282. Petitioner claimed bad debt\n\ndeductions that he was unable to substantiate. The deduction amounts\n\ncorresponded with his reported income to offset most or all of his liability for each\n\nyear. Petitioner also failed to report 1099 income.\n\f                                          -19-\n\n[*19]                b. Inadequate and Incomplete Records\n\n        Petitioner\u2019s inadequate and incomplete records failed to substantiate any\n\nbad debt deductions for the years at issue. There was no credible documentation\n\nconfirming that petitioner held debt, that the debt ever became worthless or that\n\nthe debt became worthless the year he claimed.\n\n                     c. Failure To Cooperate\n\n        Petitioner also did not cooperate with respondent. Respondent repeatedly\n\nsought additional information regarding the years at issue. Petitioner made false\n\nstatements and produced misleading or fabricated documents purportedly\n\nsubstantiating the claimed deductions.\n\n                     d. Engaging in and Concealing Illegal Conduct\n\n        Petitioner engaged in illegal conduct as he pleaded guilty to filing a false\n\nFederal income tax return for 2000. A conviction under section 7206(1) is highly\n\npersuasive evidence that a taxpayer intended to evade tax for that year. See Morse\n\nv.

Petitioner\n\nacknowledged in the plea agreement that there was no bona fide debt and that he\n\nwas not entitled to the bad debt deduction. This purported debt was the same that\n\f                                          -20-\n\n[*20] he determined became worthless and claimed as deductions for the other\n\nyears at issue. Further, petitioner attempted to conceal his illegal activity from\n\nrespondent by providing fabricated documents and misleading information.\n\n                   e. Inconsistent Explanations and Incredible Testimony\n\n      Petitioner provided inconsistent explanations that demonstrate an intent to\n\nmislead respondent. Respondent examined bad debt deductions petitioner claimed\n\nfor multiple years. Petitioner repeatedly asserted that he was entitled to the\n\ndeductions. He claimed that he reported the 1099 income in an earlier year when\n\nhe had in fact not reported the income.\n\n      Petitioner\u2019s testimony lacked credibility. He continued to assert that\n\nSeaboard and Classic Contractors were indebted to him. The record consistently\n\ncontradicted his testimony.\n\n                   f. Tax Expertise\n\n      Petitioner\u2019s experience and understanding of tax law support a finding that\n\nhe acted with fraudulent intent. See Scallen v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525241\"><a href=\"/opinion/525241/stephen-b-scallen-and-chacke-y-scallen-v-commissioner-of-internal/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1370-1371 (8th Cir. 1989), aff\u2019g T.C. Memo. 1987-412. A taxpayer\u2019s\n\nintelligence, education and sophistication are relevant in determining fraudulent\n\nintent. Scott v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2012-65; Wright v. Commissioner;\n\nT.C. Memo. 2000-336. Petitioner was a sophisticated and savvy businessman. He\n\f                                          -21-\n\n[*21] had worked as a bookkeeper and accountant. Petitioner independently\n\nresearched tax issues. We find that petitioner understood his conduct was contrary\n\nto existing tax law.\n\n                       g. Badges of Fraud Conclusion\n\n         In toto, many badges of fraud apply to petitioner. We conclude that\n\nrespondent has proven by clear and convincing evidence that there was an\n\nunderpayment for each year at issue and each underpayment was attributable to\n\nfraud.\n\n               2. Petitioner\u2019s Burden\n\n         Once the Commissioner has established by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat any portion of an underpayment is attributable to fraud, the entire\n\nunderpayment shall be treated as attributable to fraud, except with respect to any\n\nportion of the underpayment that the taxpayer establishes (by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence) is not attributable to fraud. Sec. 6663(b); see Foxworthy, Inc. v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2009-203, aff\u2019d, 494 Fed. Appx. 964 (11th Cir. 2012).\n\n         Petitioner asserts that he misunderstood the requirements to claim the bad\n\ndebt deductions because his tax professional advised him to use the accrual\n\nmethod of accounting. Respondent contends that petitioner failed to show that any\n\nportion was not attributable to fraud. We agree with respondent.\n\f                                        -22-\n\n[*22] Petitioner contends he relied on a tax professional\u2019s advice. Petitioner\n\nfailed to corroborate, however, that he received the advice he claims he did. The\n\ntax professional did not testify. And petitioner did not offer any evidence\n\ncorroborating his assertions.\n\n      Further, petitioner has not explained how advice purportedly given in the\n\n1970s informed him on whether he could claim bad debt deductions arising in the\n\n1990s. There is no indication that a tax professional reviewed relevant documents\n\nand advised petitioner on the years at issue. Rather, petitioner had a strong\n\nunderstanding of tax law and prepared returns for himself and his former\n\nemployers. His assertions are incredible, illogical and entirely unbelievable. The\n\nrecord demonstrates that petitioner consistently misled respondent and\n\nintentionally confused issues to avoid his tax obligations. Petitioner failed to\n\ndemonstrate that any portion of the income was not attributable to fraud.\n\n      Accordingly, we find that petitioner is liable for the fraud penalty under\n\nsection 6663 for each year at issue.8\n\n\n\n\n      8\n        Respondent alternatively requested we impose an accuracy-related penalty\nunder sec. 6662. In light of our fraud finding, we need not consider the accuracy-\nrelated penalty.\n\f                                        -23-\n\n[*23] B. Statute of Limitations\n\n      Petitioner also argues that the limitations periods expired before respondent\n\nassessed petitioner\u2019s tax for the years at issue. Respondent contends that the\n\nlimitations period does not apply for the years at issue because petitioner acted\n\nwith the intent to evade tax. We agree with respondent.\n\n      The Commissioner must generally make such an assessment within a\n\nthree-year period after a taxpayer files his or her return. Sec. 6501(a). In the case\n\nof a false and fraudulent return with the intent to evade tax, however, the tax may\n\nbe assessed at any time. Sec. 6501(c)(1).\n\n      We have found that petitioner is liable for the fraud penalty under section\n\n6663 for all years at issue. Respondent\u2019s burden of proof under section 6501(c)(1)\n\nis the same as that imposed under section 6663. See Browning v. Commissioner,\n\nT.C. Memo. 2011-261. We therefore hold that the limitations periods for\n\nassessing petitioner\u2019s tax are extended indefinitely. See sec. 6501(c)(1); Paterson\n\nv. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2007-109. Accordingly, respondent is not barred\n\nfrom assessing petitioner\u2019s deficiency for any year at issue. See sec. 6501(c)(1).\n\f                                          -24-\n\n[*24] VI. Conclusion\n\n         We sustain respondent\u2019s deficiency determinations for the years at issue,\n\nincluding the fraud penalty under section 6663.\n\n         In reaching these holdings, we have considered all arguments, and, to the\n\nextent not addressed here, we conclude that they are moot, irrelevant or without\n\nmerit.\n\n         To reflect the foregoing,\n\n\n\n                                                       Decision will be entered for\n\n                                                 respondent.\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
