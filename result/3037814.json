At trial, the government presented testimony from two\npolice officers who had searched Valdez\u2019s car. Although Valdez was not driving the\ncar immediately before it was searched, he identified himself as the owner and\nconsented to a search. The officers found 460.6 grams of methamphetamine in the\nvehicle. Nina Villela, who recently had pleaded guilty to unrelated drug charges and\nwas awaiting sentencing, also testified at trial. She indicated that Valdez frequently\ndistributed methamphetamine to her in quantities that ranged \u201cfrom ounces to\npounds.\u201d\n\f       Valdez moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s\ncase-in-chief, but the district court1 denied his motion. Valdez\u2019s sole defense witness\nwas his brother, Antonio Ramirez Cortez, who testified that he \u2013 not Valdez \u2013 was the\nperson who set up drug buys with Villela, and that he identified himself as \u201cEmilio\u201d\nwhen he was on the phone with her. Ramirez also testified that he was driving\nValdez\u2019s vehicle the night that it was searched, and that Valdez had not been aware\nthat there were drugs in the car.\n\n       The jury returned a verdict of guilty. A presentence investigation report\n(\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended that Valdez be held responsible for 2.28 kilograms of\nmethamphetamine, based on the 460.6 grams that were found in Valdez\u2019s car and on\nVillela\u2019s testimony that she had purchased four to five pounds of methamphetamine\nfrom Valdez. The PSR thus recommended a guideline range of 151-188 months\u2019\nimprisonment. Valdez objected to the sufficiency of evidence to support the\nrecommended drug quantity. The district court sustained the objection in part, and\nfound that the drug quantity was between 500 grams and 1.5 kilograms. Valdez was\nthen sentenced to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment and 5 years of supervised release.\n\n       Valdez\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under Anders v.\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107423\"><a href=\"/opinion/107423/anders-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1967), arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support\nValdez\u2019s conviction.
