Robbins, Member\n\n\n                                       FINAL ORDER\n\n\u00b61        The appellant has filed a petition for review of the initial decision, which\n     dismissed for lack of jurisdiction his alleged constructive suspension and alleged\n     involuntary disability retirement appeal.     Generally, we grant petitions such as\n     this one only when: the initial decision contains erroneous findings of material\n     fact; the initial decision is based on an erroneous interpretation of statute or\n\n     1\n        A nonprecedential order is one that the Board has determined does not add\n     sign ificantly to the body of MSPB case law. Parties may cite nonprecedential orders,\n     but such orders have no precedential value; the Board and administrative judges are not\n     required to follow or distinguish them in any future decisions. In contrast, a\n     precedential decision issued as an Opinion and Order has been identified by the Board\n     as significantly contributing to the Board\u2019s case law. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.117(c).\n\f                                                                                       2\n\n     regulation or the erroneous application of the law to the facts of the case; the\n     judge\u2019s rulings during either the course of the appeal or the initial decision were\n     not consistent with required procedures or involved an abuse of discretion, and\n     the resulting error affected the outcome of the case; or new and material evidence\n     or legal argument is available that, despite the petitioner\u2019s due diligence, was not\n     available when the record closed. See Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations,\n     section 1201.115 (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115). After fully considering the filings in this\n     appeal, and based on the following points and authorities, we conclude that the\n     petitioner has not established any basis under section 1201.115 for granting the\n     petition for review. Therefore, we DENY the petition for review and AFFIRM\n     the initial decision, which is now the Board\u2019s final decision.             5 C.F.R.\n     \u00a7 1201.113(b).\n\u00b62         In connection with his duties as a GS-13 Criminal Investigator with the\n     agency\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), the appellant, in 2010, initiated an\n     investigation into allegations that a female U.S. Postal Service employee\n     exaggerated her symptoms so as to qualify for continued Office of Workers\u2019\n     Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits.         Based on the report the appellant\n     prepared, the female employee was notified that OWCP intended to terminate her\n     benefits.   At a hearing which followed, she testified that she had dated the\n     appellant and that she believed the investigation he headed regarding her\n     activities was retaliatory. Initial Appeal File (IAF), Tab 23 at 48-49. In response\n     to the allegations, and despite the fact that the appellant had been in a prior\n     relationship with the female employee, he signed and submitted to OWCP a\n     statement denying ever having maintained a personal relationship with her. Id. at\n     69.\n\u00b63         Based on the female employee\u2019s allegations, the OIG\u2019s Special Inquiries\n     Division initiated an investigation into allegations that the appellant had\n     improperly failed to disclose his personal involvement with her. As a result, an\n     Assistant U.S. Attorney notified the appellant by letter dated January 8, 2013,\n\f                                                                                      3\n\n     that he was the subject of an investigation conducted by the Department of Justice\n     (DOJ) regarding possible violations of federal criminal laws and related offenses\n     pertaining to conduct and statements he made in connection with the female\n     employee and that an indictment was anticipated in the coming months. Id., Tab\n     7 at 11-12.   Based on that letter, on January 9, 2013, the agency issued the\n     appellant a notice of proposed indefinite suspension and placed him on\n     administrative leave. Id. at 13-14. On February 22, 2013, the appellant requested\n     12 weeks of sick leave to start on February 25, 2013, indicating that the agency\n     was completing its portion of his disability retirement application. Id., Tab 14 at\n     22. On February 26, 2013, the appellant submitted to the Office of Personnel\n     Management (OPM) his disability retirement application based on post-traumatic\n     stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol abuse. Id., Tab 7 at 28-31. The following\n     day, the agency amended the appellant\u2019s proposed indefinite suspension notice to\n     explain that the action was based on DOJ\u2019s pending investigation of his criminal\n     conduct which, as to his misstatement of a material fact concerning his\n     relationship with the female employee, was in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n     IAF, Tab 7 at 15-18.\n\u00b64        On April 22, 2013, the agency notified the appellant that it was rescinding\n     the notice of proposed indefinite suspension based on the decision of the U.S.\n     Attorney\u2019s Office not to charge the appellant with a crime. Id. at 18-19. The\n     agency advised the appellant, however, that, based on the information contained\n     in his disability retirement application, he would remain on Family Medical\n     Leave Act leave until his physician cleared him for duty. Id.\n\u00b65        On June 27, 2013, the appellant filed a formal complaint of discrimination\n     in which he alleged that the agency\u2019s ongoing pattern and practice of\n     discrimination and hostile work environment harassment on the basis of his race\n     (African American) forced him to take leave and compelled him to apply for\n     disability retirement. Id., Tab 25 at 34-37.\n\f                                                                                         4\n\n\u00b66         On August 30, 2013, OPM approved the appellant\u2019s application for\n      disability retirement based on PTSD. Id., Tab 7 at 24-28. Notwithstanding, on\n      September 10, 2013, the agency proposed the appellant\u2019s removal citing negligent\n      performance of duties and unprofessional conduct; that is, conduct unbecoming a\n      law enforcement officer, id., Tab 13, but no decision was issued as his retirement\n      on disability was effective on September 25, 2013, id., Tab 1 at 8.\n\u00b67         On December 23, 2013, the agency issued a final agency decision on the\n      appellant\u2019s formal discrimination complaint rejecting his claim. Id. at 10-40. On\n      appeal to the Board, he argued that the agency had constructively suspended him\n      for more than 14 days and that intolerable working conditions rendered his\n      disability retirement involuntary. Id. at 1-6. He requested a hearing. Id. at 2.\n\u00b68         Thereafter the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the\n      appellant\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Id., Tab 33, Initial Decision (ID) at 1,\n      19. The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish that his\n      disability retirement was involuntary or otherwise constituted a constructive\n      removal within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. ID at 9-13. The administrative judge\n      then addressed the appellant\u2019s constructive suspension claim, notwithstanding\n      that he was in a paid leave status at all times during the events at issue until the\n      effective date of his disability retirement, and concluded that the appellant failed\n      to establish that he was constructively suspended. ID at 13-19.\n\u00b69         The appellant has filed a petition for review, Petition for Review (PFR)\n      File, Tab 1, to which the agency has responded in opposition, id., Tabs 5-6.\n\u00b610        On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge failed to\n      consider that his indefinite suspension was improper because the agency lacked\n      reasonable cause to believe that he committed a crime for which a sentence of\n      imprisonment may be imposed, id., Tab 1, at 12-15, and that, because the agency\n      knew or should have known that it could not succeed in the indefinite suspension\n      action, the appellant\u2019s disability retirement was coerced, id. at 14-15, 18.\n\f                                                                                          5\n\n\u00b611        As the administrative judge properly found, in order to establish that a\n      disability retirement was involuntary, an appellant must establish that an\n      accommodation was available between the time his medical condition arose and\n      the date of his separation that would have allowed him to continue his\n      employment; he communicated to the agency his desire to continue working but\n      that his medical limitations required a modification of his working conditions or\n      duties; and the agency unjustifiably failed to provide him that accommodation.\n      ID at 2; see Okleson v. U.S. Postal Service, 90 M.S.P.R. 415, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8 (2001).\n      Thus, the Board generally limits its jurisdiction over alleged involuntary\n      disability retirement claims to cases where the agency improperly denied an\n      appellant\u2019s request for accommodation. Vaughan v. Department of Agriculture,\n      116 M.S.P.R. 493, \u00b6 12 (2011).          The administrative judge properly did not\n      consider whether the appellant established that his disability retirement was\n      involuntary under this test because he did not allege that he ever requested an\n      accommodation that would have enabled him to continue to perform the essential\n      duties of his position or another vacant position to which he could have been\n      reassigned.\n\u00b612        While this standard is correct to determine the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in most\n      involuntary   disability   retirement     appeals,   as   the   administrative   judge\n      acknowledged, the Board, in unusual circumstances, has applied its regular\n      principles for determining jurisdiction over alleged involuntary retirements to\n      assess the voluntariness of a disability retirement. ID at 2-3; see, e.g., Vaughan,\n      116 M.S.P.R. 493, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14 (the appellant alleged that the agency created a\n      hostile work environment which led to intolerable working conditions and\n      ultimately his disability retirement); Hosford v. Office of Personnel Management,\n      107 M.S.P.R. 418, \u00b6 9 (2007) (finding the appellant\u2019s disability retirement to be\n      involuntary on the basis of misinformation). Another of these general principles\n      of involuntariness is where an appellant shows that the agency knew that it would\n      not prevail on a proposed adverse action. In such a case, the proposed action is\n\f                                                                                       6\n\ncoercive and the resulting employee action is involuntary.                  Baldwin v.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, 109 M.S.P.R. 392, \u00b6 12 (2008). The appellant\nhere contends that the agency knew or should have known that it could not prevail\non its proposed indefinite suspension action. 2 The appellant argues that the mere\nexistence of an agency\u2019s investigation or inquiry into allegations of misconduct\ndoes not constitute a circumstance justifying, or cause for imposing, an indefinite\nsuspension. 3 Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security, 114 M.S.P.R. 318,\n\u00b6 28 (2010). In fact, however, the investigation in this case was not conducted by\nthe agency but rather by DOJ. IAF, Tab 7 at 11-12. In any event, we need not\ndetermine whether the agency\u2019s proposed indefinite suspension was proper or\nwhether such an action, which is short of a proposed removal, can trigger the\nknew or should have known principle of involuntariness upon which the appellant\nrelies.   That is so because, while the appellant\u2019s application for disability\nretirement was pending, the agency rescinded the notice of proposed indefinite\nsuspension. Id. at 18-19. Although that action removed the threat of indefinite\nsuspension, the appellant did not seek to withdraw his application at that time or\nat any time during the following 4 months while OPM was considering his\napplication.    Id. at 24-28.    These circumstances preclude a finding that the\nappellant was coerced to retire because of the agency\u2019s proposed indefinite\nsuspension. 4\n\n2\n  As noted, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not establish that the\nagency knew or should have known that it could not have sustained a decision to\nremove him based on the charges set forth in the proposal notice. ID at 13.\n3\n  The appellant also argues that the proposed indefinite suspension was improper\nbecause the agency failed to show that it had reasonable cause to believe that he had\ncommitted a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. PFR File,\nTab 1 at 12-13. Our reviewing court has found, however, that the \u201creasonable cause to\nbelieve\u201d clause in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(b)(1) is not a substantive requirement for imposing\nan indefin ite suspension after at least 30 days\u2019 notice. Perez v. Department of Justice,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"210734\"><a href=\"/opinion/210734/perez-v-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\n4\n  Because this case was decided after a hearing, the issue is not whether the appellant\nraised a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction but whether he established jurisdiction\n\f                                                                                       7\n\n\u00b613        The administrative judge found that the appellant presented very little\n      evidence in support of his claim that the agency treated African-American\n      employees more harshly than white employees, ID at 11-12, and that he therefore\n      failed to establish that the agency engaged in racially discriminatory conduct that\n      caused him to become disabled and rendered his disability retirement involuntary.\n      ID at 9-13. The administrative judge also considered the appellant\u2019s claim that\n      the agency\u2019s actions in investigating his potentially criminal conduct regarding\n      the investigation of the female employee exacerbated his PTSD to the point where\n      he was no longer medically able to fulfill his duties, concluding that, while the\n      appellant may have reasonably believed that the exacerbation of his PTSD as a\n      result of the agency\u2019s investigation left him with no meaningful choice other than\n      to apply for disability retirement, he failed to show that the agency engaged in\n      wrongful actions that deprived him of such a meaningful choice.          ID at 12.\n      Finally, the administrative judge considered the appellant\u2019s assertion that the\n      agency coerced his retirement by proposing his removal and/or by reissuing the\n      Standard Form (SF) 50 documenting his retirement to reflect that his application\n      was approved during the pendency of a removal action for cause. As noted, the\n      administrative judge found that the appellant did not establish that the agency\n      knew or should have known that it could not have sustained a decision to remove\n      him based on the charges set forth in the proposal notice, that the reissued SF-50\n      was processed after the appellant learned that OPM had approved his disability\n      retirement application, and that he did not show that the change affected his\n      decision to retire.   ID at 13.   The appellant does not otherwise challenge the\n      administrative judge\u2019s findings that he failed to establish that his disability\n      retirement was involuntary and we discern no basis upon which to disturb those\n      findings. Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997) (finding\n      no reason to disturb the administrative judge\u2019s findings where he considered the\n\n      by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., Salazar v. Department of the Army,\n      115 M.S.P.R. 296, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 12 (2010).\n\f                                                                                        8\n\n      evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned\n      conclusions).\n\u00b614        On review, the appellant also challenges the administrative judge\u2019s findings\n      with regard to the periods of alleged constructive suspension. PFR File, Tab 1 at\n      18-20.    As the administrative judge correctly found, to establish Board\n      jurisdiction over a constructive suspension claim, an appellant must show that he\n      lacked a meaningful choice in the matter and that it was the agency\u2019s wrongful\n      actions that deprived him of that choice. ID at 4; see Bean v. U.S. Postal Service,\n      120 M.S.P.R. 397, \u00b6 8 (2013).      The appellant first addresses the period from\n      January 9, 2013, when he was first placed on paid administrative leave, through\n      April 21, 2013, the day before the amended notice of proposed indefinite\n      suspension was rescinded. He asserts that, because he reasonably believed that\n      his administrative leave would end on February 22, 2013, he was left with no\n      choice but to make his request that day for 12 weeks of sick leave. PFR File,\n      Tab 1 at 19. We note that, in a prehearing order, the administrative judge found\n      that, because the appellant was on administrative leave from January 9, 2013,\n      through February 22, 2013, he failed to nonfrivolously allege that he was\n      subjected to an appealable suspension during that period of time. IAF, Tab 11 at\n      1-2. The appellant did not challenge that finding, id., Tab 12, and we find no\n      basis to disturb it, see LaMell v. Armed Forces Retirement Home, 104 M.S.P.R.\n      413, \u00b6 9 (2007).\n\u00b615        As to the period from February 25, 2013, the first day of the appellant\u2019s\n      sick leave, through April 21, 2013, the day before the agency rescinded the\n      amended notice of proposed indefinite suspension, the appellant alleges that,\n      because he believed his administrative leave was ending, he had no choice but to\n      use sick leave. PFR File, Tab 1 at 18-19. The administrative judge found, based\n      on a series of emails between management officials, that the appellant believed,\n      at least initially, that the agency would place him in an unpaid status at the\n      expiration of the 30-day notice period that followed his receipt of the first notice\n\f                                                                                        9\n\n      of proposed indefinite suspension and that this was so despite the fact that the\n      agency could not have properly placed him in an unpaid status, even if the 30-day\n      advanced notice period expired prior to the issuance of a decision letter. ID at\n      14-17.   The administrative judge found, however, that, when the appellant\n      requested sick leave, he knew he was still on administrative leave and receiving\n      pay even though the 30-day notice period had passed and that he therefore should\n      have known that any perception he may have had that the agency would place him\n      in unpaid status at the end of that notice period was incorrect. The administrative\n      judge concluded, therefore, that the appellant failed to establish that his absence\n      during this period was a constructive suspension within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\n      ID at 17.   Despite his disagreement, the appellant has not shown error in the\n      administrative judge\u2019s findings.    The appellant has not shown that, when he\n      requested sick leave, he lacked any meaningful choice but to do so because of a\n      wrongful act by the agency. See Bean, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, \u00b6 8.\n\u00b616        As to the period between April 22, 2013, when the agency rescinded the\n      amended notice of proposed indefinite suspension, and September 25, 2013, the\n      effective date of his disability retirement, the appellant argues that he was\n      constructively suspended because he had no choice but to remain on sick leave\n      and the agency had improperly proposed his indefinite suspension. PFR File, Tab\n      1 at 19-20. The administrative judge found that, although the appellant\u2019s choice\n      to remain on sick leave until OPM approved his disability retirement application\n      or to return to duty was not a meaningful one because OPM ultimately determined\n      that he was medically unable to perform his duties, ID at 17-18, it was not the\n      agency\u2019s wrongful actions that deprived the appellant of that choice.        As the\n      administrative judge found, even if the agency\u2019s undertaking of the investigation\n      into the appellant\u2019s misconduct may have exacerbated his PTSD, the agency acted\n      within its authority in conducting that investigation, and it also acted properly in\n      not allowing him to return to duty until he had been medically cleared. ID at 18;\n      IAF, Tab 30 at 152. Although the appellant argues that the notices of proposed\n\f                                                                                 10\n\nindefinite suspension \u201cchanged the tide\u201d for him, PFR File, Tab 1 at 20, he has\nnot shown how those proposals, which, at the time in question, had been\nrescinded, constituted wrongful action by the agency that deprived him of a\nmeaningful choice to return to work.

Generally, we grant petitions such as\n     this one only when: the initial decision contains erroneous findings of material\n     fact; the initial decision is based on an erroneous interpretation of statute or\n\n     1\n        A nonprecedential order is one that the Board has determined does not add\n     sign ificantly to the body of MSPB case law. Parties may cite nonprecedential orders,\n     but such orders have no precedential value; the Board and administrative judges are not\n     required to follow or distinguish them in any future decisions. In contrast, a\n     precedential decision issued as an Opinion and Order has been identified by the Board\n     as significantly contributing to the Board\u2019s case law. See 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.117(c).\n\f                                                                                       2\n\n     regulation or the erroneous application of the law to the facts of the case; the\n     judge\u2019s rulings during either the course of the appeal or the initial decision were\n     not consistent with required procedures or involved an abuse of discretion, and\n     the resulting error affected the outcome of the case; or new and material evidence\n     or legal argument is available that, despite the petitioner\u2019s due diligence, was not\n     available when the record closed. See Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations,\n     section 1201.115 (5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115). After fully considering the filings in this\n     appeal, and based on the following points and authorities, we conclude that the\n     petitioner has not established any basis under section 1201.115 for granting the\n     petition for review. Therefore, we DENY the petition for review and AFFIRM\n     the initial decision, which is now the Board\u2019s final decision.             5 C.F.R.\n     \u00a7 1201.113(b).\n\u00b62         In connection with his duties as a GS-13 Criminal Investigator with the\n     agency\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), the appellant, in 2010, initiated an\n     investigation into allegations that a female U.S. Postal Service employee\n     exaggerated her symptoms so as to qualify for continued Office of Workers\u2019\n     Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits.         Based on the report the appellant\n     prepared, the female employee was notified that OWCP intended to terminate her\n     benefits.   At a hearing which followed, she testified that she had dated the\n     appellant and that she believed the investigation he headed regarding her\n     activities was retaliatory. Initial Appeal File (IAF), Tab 23 at 48-49. In response\n     to the allegations, and despite the fact that the appellant had been in a prior\n     relationship with the female employee, he signed and submitted to OWCP a\n     statement denying ever having maintained a personal relationship with her. Id. at\n     69.\n\u00b63         Based on the female employee\u2019s allegations, the OIG\u2019s Special Inquiries\n     Division initiated an investigation into allegations that the appellant had\n     improperly failed to disclose his personal involvement with her. As a result, an\n     Assistant U.S. Attorney notified the appellant by letter dated January 8, 2013,\n\f                                                                                      3\n\n     that he was the subject of an investigation conducted by the Department of Justice\n     (DOJ) regarding possible violations of federal criminal laws and related offenses\n     pertaining to conduct and statements he made in connection with the female\n     employee and that an indictment was anticipated in the coming months. Id., Tab\n     7 at 11-12.   Based on that letter, on January 9, 2013, the agency issued the\n     appellant a notice of proposed indefinite suspension and placed him on\n     administrative leave. Id. at 13-14. On February 22, 2013, the appellant requested\n     12 weeks of sick leave to start on February 25, 2013, indicating that the agency\n     was completing its portion of his disability retirement application. Id., Tab 14 at\n     22. On February 26, 2013, the appellant submitted to the Office of Personnel\n     Management (OPM) his disability retirement application based on post-traumatic\n     stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol abuse. Id., Tab 7 at 28-31. The following\n     day, the agency amended the appellant\u2019s proposed indefinite suspension notice to\n     explain that the action was based on DOJ\u2019s pending investigation of his criminal\n     conduct which, as to his misstatement of a material fact concerning his\n     relationship with the female employee, was in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n     IAF, Tab 7 at 15-18.\n\u00b64        On April 22, 2013, the agency notified the appellant that it was rescinding\n     the notice of proposed indefinite suspension based on the decision of the U.S.\n     Attorney\u2019s Office not to charge the appellant with a crime. Id. at 18-19. The\n     agency advised the appellant, however, that, based on the information contained\n     in his disability retirement application, he would remain on Family Medical\n     Leave Act leave until his physician cleared him for duty. Id.\n\u00b65        On June 27, 2013, the appellant filed a formal complaint of discrimination\n     in which he alleged that the agency\u2019s ongoing pattern and practice of\n     discrimination and hostile work environment harassment on the basis of his race\n     (African American) forced him to take leave and compelled him to apply for\n     disability retirement. Id., Tab 25 at 34-37.\n\f                                                                                         4\n\n\u00b66         On August 30, 2013, OPM approved the appellant\u2019s application for\n      disability retirement based on PTSD. Id., Tab 7 at 24-28. Notwithstanding, on\n      September 10, 2013, the agency proposed the appellant\u2019s removal citing negligent\n      performance of duties and unprofessional conduct; that is, conduct unbecoming a\n      law enforcement officer, id., Tab 13, but no decision was issued as his retirement\n      on disability was effective on September 25, 2013, id., Tab 1 at 8.\n\u00b67         On December 23, 2013, the agency issued a final agency decision on the\n      appellant\u2019s formal discrimination complaint rejecting his claim. Id. at 10-40. On\n      appeal to the Board, he argued that the agency had constructively suspended him\n      for more than 14 days and that intolerable working conditions rendered his\n      disability retirement involuntary. Id. at 1-6. He requested a hearing. Id. at 2.\n\u00b68         Thereafter the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the\n      appellant\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Id., Tab 33, Initial Decision (ID) at 1,\n      19. The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish that his\n      disability retirement was involuntary or otherwise constituted a constructive\n      removal within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. ID at 9-13. The administrative judge\n      then addressed the appellant\u2019s constructive suspension claim, notwithstanding\n      that he was in a paid leave status at all times during the events at issue until the\n      effective date of his disability retirement, and concluded that the appellant failed\n      to establish that he was constructively suspended. ID at 13-19.\n\u00b69         The appellant has filed a petition for review, Petition for Review (PFR)\n      File, Tab 1, to which the agency has responded in opposition, id., Tabs 5-6.\n\u00b610        On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge failed to\n      consider that his indefinite suspension was improper because the agency lacked\n      reasonable cause to believe that he committed a crime for which a sentence of\n      imprisonment may be imposed, id., Tab 1, at 12-15, and that, because the agency\n      knew or should have known that it could not succeed in the indefinite suspension\n      action, the appellant\u2019s disability retirement was coerced, id. at 14-15, 18.\n\f                                                                                          5\n\n\u00b611        As the administrative judge properly found, in order to establish that a\n      disability retirement was involuntary, an appellant must establish that an\n      accommodation was available between the time his medical condition arose and\n      the date of his separation that would have allowed him to continue his\n      employment; he communicated to the agency his desire to continue working but\n      that his medical limitations required a modification of his working conditions or\n      duties; and the agency unjustifiably failed to provide him that accommodation.\n      ID at 2; see Okleson v. U.S. Postal Service, 90 M.S.P.R. 415, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8 (2001).\n      Thus, the Board generally limits its jurisdiction over alleged involuntary\n      disability retirement claims to cases where the agency improperly denied an\n      appellant\u2019s request for accommodation. Vaughan v. Department of Agriculture,\n      116 M.S.P.R. 493, \u00b6 12 (2011).          The administrative judge properly did not\n      consider whether the appellant established that his disability retirement was\n      involuntary under this test because he did not allege that he ever requested an\n      accommodation that would have enabled him to continue to perform the essential\n      duties of his position or another vacant position to which he could have been\n      reassigned.\n\u00b612        While this standard is correct to determine the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in most\n      involuntary   disability   retirement     appeals,   as   the   administrative   judge\n      acknowledged, the Board, in unusual circumstances, has applied its regular\n      principles for determining jurisdiction over alleged involuntary retirements to\n      assess the voluntariness of a disability retirement. ID at 2-3; see, e.g., Vaughan,\n      116 M.S.P.R. 493, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14 (the appellant alleged that the agency created a\n      hostile work environment which led to intolerable working conditions and\n      ultimately his disability retirement); Hosford v. Office of Personnel Management,\n      107 M.S.P.R. 418, \u00b6 9 (2007) (finding the appellant\u2019s disability retirement to be\n      involuntary on the basis of misinformation). Another of these general principles\n      of involuntariness is where an appellant shows that the agency knew that it would\n      not prevail on a proposed adverse action. In such a case, the proposed action is\n\f                                                                                       6\n\ncoercive and the resulting employee action is involuntary.                  Baldwin v.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, 109 M.S.P.R. 392, \u00b6 12 (2008). The appellant\nhere contends that the agency knew or should have known that it could not prevail\non its proposed indefinite suspension action. 2 The appellant argues that the mere\nexistence of an agency\u2019s investigation or inquiry into allegations of misconduct\ndoes not constitute a circumstance justifying, or cause for imposing, an indefinite\nsuspension. 3 Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security, 114 M.S.P.R. 318,\n\u00b6 28 (2010). In fact, however, the investigation in this case was not conducted by\nthe agency but rather by DOJ. IAF, Tab 7 at 11-12. In any event, we need not\ndetermine whether the agency\u2019s proposed indefinite suspension was proper or\nwhether such an action, which is short of a proposed removal, can trigger the\nknew or should have known principle of involuntariness upon which the appellant\nrelies.   That is so because, while the appellant\u2019s application for disability\nretirement was pending, the agency rescinded the notice of proposed indefinite\nsuspension. Id. at 18-19. Although that action removed the threat of indefinite\nsuspension, the appellant did not seek to withdraw his application at that time or\nat any time during the following 4 months while OPM was considering his\napplication.    Id. at 24-28.    These circumstances preclude a finding that the\nappellant was coerced to retire because of the agency\u2019s proposed indefinite\nsuspension. 4\n\n2\n  As noted, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not establish that the\nagency knew or should have known that it could not have sustained a decision to\nremove him based on the charges set forth in the proposal notice. ID at 13.\n3\n  The appellant also argues that the proposed indefinite suspension was improper\nbecause the agency failed to show that it had reasonable cause to believe that he had\ncommitted a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. PFR File,\nTab 1 at 12-13. Our reviewing court has found, however, that the \u201creasonable cause to\nbelieve\u201d clause in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(b)(1) is not a substantive requirement for imposing\nan indefin ite suspension after at least 30 days\u2019 notice. Perez v. Department of Justice,\n480 F.3d 1309, 1313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\n4\n  Because this case was decided after a hearing, the issue is not whether the appellant\nraised a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction but whether he established jurisdiction\n\f                                                                                       7\n\n\u00b613        The administrative judge found that the appellant presented very little\n      evidence in support of his claim that the agency treated African-American\n      employees more harshly than white employees, ID at 11-12, and that he therefore\n      failed to establish that the agency engaged in racially discriminatory conduct that\n      caused him to become disabled and rendered his disability retirement involuntary.\n      ID at 9-13. The administrative judge also considered the appellant\u2019s claim that\n      the agency\u2019s actions in investigating his potentially criminal conduct regarding\n      the investigation of the female employee exacerbated his PTSD to the point where\n      he was no longer medically able to fulfill his duties, concluding that, while the\n      appellant may have reasonably believed that the exacerbation of his PTSD as a\n      result of the agency\u2019s investigation left him with no meaningful choice other than\n      to apply for disability retirement, he failed to show that the agency engaged in\n      wrongful actions that deprived him of such a meaningful choice.          ID at 12.\n      Finally, the administrative judge considered the appellant\u2019s assertion that the\n      agency coerced his retirement by proposing his removal and/or by reissuing the\n      Standard Form (SF) 50 documenting his retirement to reflect that his application\n      was approved during the pendency of a removal action for cause. As noted, the\n      administrative judge found that the appellant did not establish that the agency\n      knew or should have known that it could not have sustained a decision to remove\n      him based on the charges set forth in the proposal notice, that the reissued SF-50\n      was processed after the appellant learned that OPM had approved his disability\n      retirement application, and that he did not show that the change affected his\n      decision to retire.   ID at 13.   The appellant does not otherwise challenge the\n      administrative judge\u2019s findings that he failed to establish that his disability\n      retirement was involuntary and we discern no basis upon which to disturb those\n      findings. Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997) (finding\n      no reason to disturb the administrative judge\u2019s findings where he considered the\n\n      by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., Salazar v. Department of the Army,\n      115 M.S.P.R. 296, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 12 (2010).\n\f                                                                                        8\n\n      evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned\n      conclusions).\n\u00b614        On review, the appellant also challenges the administrative judge\u2019s findings\n      with regard to the periods of alleged constructive suspension. PFR File, Tab 1 at\n      18-20.    As the administrative judge correctly found, to establish Board\n      jurisdiction over a constructive suspension claim, an appellant must show that he\n      lacked a meaningful choice in the matter and that it was the agency\u2019s wrongful\n      actions that deprived him of that choice. ID at 4; see Bean v. U.S. Postal Service,\n      120 M.S.P.R. 397, \u00b6 8 (2013).      The appellant first addresses the period from\n      January 9, 2013, when he was first placed on paid administrative leave, through\n      April 21, 2013, the day before the amended notice of proposed indefinite\n      suspension was rescinded. He asserts that, because he reasonably believed that\n      his administrative leave would end on February 22, 2013, he was left with no\n      choice but to make his request that day for 12 weeks of sick leave. PFR File,\n      Tab 1 at 19. We note that, in a prehearing order, the administrative judge found\n      that, because the appellant was on administrative leave from January 9, 2013,\n      through February 22, 2013, he failed to nonfrivolously allege that he was\n      subjected to an appealable suspension during that period of time. IAF, Tab 11 at\n      1-2. The appellant did not challenge that finding, id., Tab 12, and we find no\n      basis to disturb it, see LaMell v. Armed Forces Retirement Home, 104 M.S.P.R.\n      413, \u00b6 9 (2007).\n\u00b615        As to the period from February 25, 2013, the first day of the appellant\u2019s\n      sick leave, through April 21, 2013, the day before the agency rescinded the\n      amended notice of proposed indefinite suspension, the appellant alleges that,\n      because he believed his administrative leave was ending, he had no choice but to\n      use sick leave. PFR File, Tab 1 at 18-19. The administrative judge found, based\n      on a series of emails between management officials, that the appellant believed,\n      at least initially, that the agency would place him in an unpaid status at the\n      expiration of the 30-day notice period that followed his receipt of the first notice\n\f                                                                                        9\n\n      of proposed indefinite suspension and that this was so despite the fact that the\n      agency could not have properly placed him in an unpaid status, even if the 30-day\n      advanced notice period expired prior to the issuance of a decision letter. ID at\n      14-17.   The administrative judge found, however, that, when the appellant\n      requested sick leave, he knew he was still on administrative leave and receiving\n      pay even though the 30-day notice period had passed and that he therefore should\n      have known that any perception he may have had that the agency would place him\n      in unpaid status at the end of that notice period was incorrect. The administrative\n      judge concluded, therefore, that the appellant failed to establish that his absence\n      during this period was a constructive suspension within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction.\n      ID at 17.   Despite his disagreement, the appellant has not shown error in the\n      administrative judge\u2019s findings.    The appellant has not shown that, when he\n      requested sick leave, he lacked any meaningful choice but to do so because of a\n      wrongful act by the agency. See Bean, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, \u00b6 8.\n\u00b616        As to the period between April 22, 2013, when the agency rescinded the\n      amended notice of proposed indefinite suspension, and September 25, 2013, the\n      effective date of his disability retirement, the appellant argues that he was\n      constructively suspended because he had no choice but to remain on sick leave\n      and the agency had improperly proposed his indefinite suspension. PFR File, Tab\n      1 at 19-20. The administrative judge found that, although the appellant\u2019s choice\n      to remain on sick leave until OPM approved his disability retirement application\n      or to return to duty was not a meaningful one because OPM ultimately determined\n      that he was medically unable to perform his duties, ID at 17-18, it was not the\n      agency\u2019s wrongful actions that deprived the appellant of that choice.        As the\n      administrative judge found, even if the agency\u2019s undertaking of the investigation\n      into the appellant\u2019s misconduct may have exacerbated his PTSD, the agency acted\n      within its authority in conducting that investigation, and it also acted properly in\n      not allowing him to return to duty until he had been medically cleared. ID at 18;\n      IAF, Tab 30 at 152. Although the appellant argues that the notices of proposed\n\f                                                                                 10\n\nindefinite suspension \u201cchanged the tide\u201d for him, PFR File, Tab 1 at 20, he has\nnot shown how those proposals, which, at the time in question, had been\nrescinded, constituted wrongful action by the agency that deprived him of a\nmeaningful choice to return to work. See Bean, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, \u00b6 8.\n\n                  NOTICE TO THE APPELLANT REGARDING\n                     YOUR FURTHER REVIEW RIGHTS\n     You have the right to request review of this final decision by the United\nStates Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
