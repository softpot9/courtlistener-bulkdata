See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 11.072, \u00a7 8. The clerk\u2019s record contains\n\na trial court certification reflecting that appellant has waived his right to appeal. However, that\n\ncertification relates to appellant\u2019s judgment of conviction, not the order denying the application for\n\nhabeas corpus. The clerk\u2019s record does not contain the required trial court certification of appellant\u2019s\n\nright of appeal concerning the order denying habeas relief, which is the order appellant seeks to\n\nappeal here. See Tex. R.

Accordingly, we abate this appeal and remand the\n\ncase to the trial court for entry of a certification of appellant\u2019s right of appeal from the order\n\ndenying habeas corpus relief as required by Rule 25.2(a)(2).
