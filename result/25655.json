Hansen requests the requisite\n\ncertificate of appealability (COA) for each of several issues,\n\nconcerning his conviction and sentence.     DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that\nthis opinion should not be published and is not precedent except\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f                                   I.\n\n     On 10 April 1987, having left Florida earlier that day, Hansen\n\nand Anita Louise Krecic were traveling on Interstate 10 in Harrison\n\nCounty, Mississippi, in a blue Lincoln (town car); Hansen was\n\ndriving.     Observing erratic driving and speeding, Mississippi\n\nHighway Safety Patrol Officer (State Trooper) David Bruce Ladner\n\nsignaled for Hansen to pull over.         Officer Ladner requested to\n\nsearch the vehicle.     Hansen and Krecic, using fictitious names,\n\nsigned a consent to search form.\n\n     Subsequently, Hansen fired a .38 caliber pistol at Officer\n\nLadner.    After the Officer took evasive action, Hansen fired twice\n\nmore at close range, each shot striking the Officer in the back.\n\nThe Officer managed to reach the median, and a passing motorist\n\ntook him to a hospital; he died approximately 31 hours later.\n\n     Because the Officer had taken the keys to their vehicle,\n\nHansen and Krecic took the Officer\u2019s patrol car to an I-10 exit.\n\nThey immediately pulled over, and took, a Ford Ranger driven by\n\nDaisy Morgan, leaving her there.\n\n     After unsuccessfully seeking transportation to New Orleans,\n\nLouisiana, Hansen and Krecic reached a home in Hancock County,\n\nMississippi.    Persons there agreed to take Hansen and Krecic to\n\nWaveland,   Mississippi;   en   route,   they   were   stopped   by   State\n\nTroopers.    Hansen and Krecic were taken into custody.

(Confrontation Clause claim).\n\n      In 1987, Hansen was found guilty in a capital murder trial.\n\nAfter the penalty hearing, he was sentenced to death because the\n\njury found: the capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious,\n\nor   cruel,    and    was   committed    for   the   purpose    of    avoiding    or\n\npreventing lawful arrest, or effecting an escape from custody; and\n\nthese aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating.

In\n\nMalone, the petitioner, on application for post-conviction relief,\n\nasserted there was a plea bargain agreement between the prosecution\n\nand its star witness that had not been disclosed pre-trial.       486\n\nSo. 2d at 368.     Concluding the petitioner made a prima facie\n\nshowing there was such a plea agreement, the Mississippi Supreme\n\nCourt remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the issue; the court did not cite, much less discuss,\n\nthe \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar.      Id. at 369.   We, thus, have no\n\nway of knowing whether the petitioner could have raised his Brady\n\nclaim on direct appeal.   Moreover, in Malone, the issue was whether\n\n                                  16\n\fthe plea bargain even existed pre-trial.

In support of this\n\nclaim, Hansen challenges the following decision by the district\n\ncourt to not consider Duncan\u2019s affidavit: \u201c[T]he transcript of the\n\ninterview [of Duncan] by the two officers is the subject of the\n\nBrady claim, not Duncan\u2019s affidavit statements.

Hansen requests the requisite\n\ncertificate of appealability (COA) for each of several issues,\n\nconcerning his conviction and sentence.     DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that\nthis opinion should not be published and is not precedent except\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f                                   I.\n\n     On 10 April 1987, having left Florida earlier that day, Hansen\n\nand Anita Louise Krecic were traveling on Interstate 10 in Harrison\n\nCounty, Mississippi, in a blue Lincoln (town car); Hansen was\n\ndriving.     Observing erratic driving and speeding, Mississippi\n\nHighway Safety Patrol Officer (State Trooper) David Bruce Ladner\n\nsignaled for Hansen to pull over.         Officer Ladner requested to\n\nsearch the vehicle.     Hansen and Krecic, using fictitious names,\n\nsigned a consent to search form.\n\n     Subsequently, Hansen fired a .38 caliber pistol at Officer\n\nLadner.    After the Officer took evasive action, Hansen fired twice\n\nmore at close range, each shot striking the Officer in the back.\n\nThe Officer managed to reach the median, and a passing motorist\n\ntook him to a hospital; he died approximately 31 hours later.\n\n     Because the Officer had taken the keys to their vehicle,\n\nHansen and Krecic took the Officer\u2019s patrol car to an I-10 exit.\n\nThey immediately pulled over, and took, a Ford Ranger driven by\n\nDaisy Morgan, leaving her there.\n\n     After unsuccessfully seeking transportation to New Orleans,\n\nLouisiana, Hansen and Krecic reached a home in Hancock County,\n\nMississippi.    Persons there agreed to take Hansen and Krecic to\n\nWaveland,   Mississippi;   en   route,   they   were   stopped   by   State\n\nTroopers.    Hansen and Krecic were taken into custody.          A further\n\n\n\n\n                                   2\n\fdescription concerning the incident, including other witnesses,\n\nappears infra in part II.E. (Confrontation Clause claim).\n\n      In 1987, Hansen was found guilty in a capital murder trial.\n\nAfter the penalty hearing, he was sentenced to death because the\n\njury found: the capital offense was especially heinous, atrocious,\n\nor   cruel,    and    was   committed    for   the   purpose    of    avoiding    or\n\npreventing lawful arrest, or effecting an escape from custody; and\n\nthese aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating.                       See\n\nMISS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 99-19-101(3) (jury must find sufficient aggravating\n\ncircumstances,        enumerated    in   subsection    (5)     of    statute,    not\n\noutweighed by mitigating circumstances, subsection (6)).\n\n      Through    an    extremely     comprehensive     opinion       covering    the\n\napproximately 45 issues raised on direct appeal, the Mississippi\n\nSupreme Court affirmed.          Hansen v. State, 592 So. 2d 114 (Miss.\n\n1991).    Review was denied by the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates.   Hansen v. Mississippi, 504 U.S. 921 (1992).\n\n      Hansen    sought      post-conviction     relief   in    the    Mississippi\n\nSupreme Court; relief was denied, except for one issue concerning\n\nthe method of execution.           Hansen v. State, 649 So. 2d 1256 (Miss.\n\n1994).    Hansen had been sentenced erroneously to death by lethal\n\ngas; the case was remanded to the circuit court for modification of\n\nthe sentence to death by lethal injection.               Id. at 1260.      Review\n\nwas again denied by the Supreme Court of the United States.                Hansen\n\nv. Mississippi, 516 U.S. 986 (1995).\n\n\n                                         3\n\f     Hansen presented 17 issues in his July 1996 federal habeas\n\npetition, adding another by supplement in early 1997.               In its\n\ndetailed opinion, the district court concluded five claims were\n\nprocedurally barred; in addition, it considered, and rejected, each\n\nclaim on the merits.       Hansen v. Puckett, No. 1:96cv60BrR (S.D.\n\nMiss. 5 Aug. 1999) (unpublished) (Hansen-USDC).\n\n                                    II.\n\n     Hansen having filed his federal habeas petition after the 24\n\nApril 1996 effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\n\nPenalty Act (AEDPA), that Act applies.         Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S.\n\n320, 336 (1997).    Accordingly, Hansen must obtain a COA in order to\n\nappeal the denial of habeas relief.        28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A).    To\n\nobtain a COA, he must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of\n\na constitutional right\u201d.        Id. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).       In general, Hansen\n\nmust demonstrate \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for\n\nthat matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in\n\na different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to\n\ndeserve encouragement to proceed further\u201d.        Slack v. McDaniel, 529\n\nU.S. 473, 484 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Restated,\n\nfor claims denied on the merits, Hansen must show \u201creasonable\n\njurists   would    find   the   district    court\u2019s    assessment   of   the\n\nconstitutional claims debatable or wrong\u201d.            Id.   But, for relief\n\ndenied on procedural grounds, Hansen must not only make the showing\n\ndescribed above concerning the merits of a claim, but also must\n\n\n                                     4\n\fshow \u201cjurists        of    reason   would         find    it   debatable    whether   the\n\ndistrict court was correct in its procedural ruling\u201d.                           Id.\n\n       Obviously, \u201cthe determination of whether a COA should issue\n\nmust be made by viewing [Hansen]\u2019s arguments through the lens of\n\nthe    deferential        scheme    laid      out    in     28    U.S.C.    \u00a7    2254(d)\u201d.\n\nBarrientes v. Johnson, 221 F.3d 741, 772 (5th Cir. 2000), cert.\n\ndismissed, 121 S. Ct. 902 (2001).                    In that regard, concerning \u00a7\n\n2254(d), when a claim has been adjudicated on the merits in state\n\ncourt, a federal habeas court must defer to that decision unless it\n\n\u201c[is] contrary to, or involve[s] an unreasonable application of,\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\nof    the   United   States;       or   ...       [is]    based   on   an   unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in [the] light of the evidence presented\n\nin the State court proceeding\u201d.                     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) & (2)\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n       For the \u00a7 2254 \u201ccontrary to\u201d prong, a decision is \u201ccontrary to\n\n[] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n\nCourt ... if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to\n\nthat reached by th[e] Court on a question of law or if the state\n\ncourt decides a case differently than th[e] Court has on a set of\n\nmaterially indistinguishable facts\u201d.                     Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.\n\n362, 412-13 (2000).         And, for the \u00a7 2254 \u201cunreasonable application\n\nof\u201d prong, a decision \u201cinvolve[s] an unreasonable application of []\n\nclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\n\n\n                                              5\n\f... if the state court identifies the correct governing legal\n\nprinciple from th[e] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies\n\nthat principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case\u201d.                   Id.   A state\n\ncourt\u2019s findings of fact are presumed correct unless the petitioner\n\nrebuts that presumption by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d.                        28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).\n\n      Hansen seeks a COA for each of six claims.                 He maintains the\n\ndistrict court:       (1) applied the wrong standard of review; (2)\n\nerred in holding he was not denied effective assistance of counsel\n\nat the penalty phase; (3) erred in concluding his Brady claim and\n\nconcomitant claim for resulting ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nwere procedurally barred and, in the alternative, without merit;\n\n(4) misapplied Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1 (1986), in\n\nupholding the exclusion of a social worker\u2019s testimony at the\n\npenalty     phase;   and   (5)   applied     the   wrong    legal     standard     in\n\nconcluding a Confrontation Clause violation was harmless error.\n\nFor   his   sixth    claim,   Hansen    contends     he    was    entitled    to    an\n\nevidentiary hearing in district court.\n\n                                        A.\n\n      Hansen asserts that, in two respects, the district court\n\napplied erroneous standards of review.\n\n                                        1.\n\n      First,   Hansen      contends    the   court   erred       by   applying     the\n\n\u201creasonable jurists\u201d standard of review announced in Drinkard v.\n\n\n                                        6\n\fJohnson, 97 F.3d 751, 769 (5th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S.\n\n1107 (1997), a standard later rejected in Williams, 529 U.S. at\n\n410.\n\n       The district court referred in a footnote to the Drinkard\n\n\u201creasonable jurists\u201d standard.            Hansen-USDC, at 7 n.1.      That\n\nstandard, however, was not mentioned again or made part of the\n\ncourt\u2019s analysis.     Therefore, although the district court erred by\n\nciting    Drinkard,   the   error   was   harmless,   and,   thus,   not   a\n\nsufficient basis upon which to grant a COA.        Moore v. Johnson, 225\n\nF.3d 495, 500 n.1 (5th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1420\n\n(2001).\n\n                                     2.\n\n       Hansen contends the district court also erred by applying \u00a7\n\n2254(d)(1) to his ineffective assistance claims because, according\n\nto Hansen, the Mississippi Supreme Court did not adjudicate those\n\nclaims on the merits, but summarily denied them, erroneously\n\napplying the rule of collateral estoppel and failing to remand for\n\nan evidentiary hearing or to make findings of fact.\n\n       \u201c\u2018Resolution on the merits\u2019 is a term of art in the habeas\n\ncontext that refers not to the quality of a court\u2019s review of\n\nclaims, but rather to the court\u2019s disposition of the case \u2014 whether\n\nsubstantive or procedural.\u201d      Green v. Johnson, 116 F.3d 1115, 1121\n\n(5th Cir. 1997).      To determine whether a resolution was on the\n\nmerits, we consider:        what the state court has done in similar\n\n                                     7\n\fcases; whether the history of the case suggests the state court was\n\naware of any procedural grounds; and whether the state court\u2019s\n\nopinion suggests reliance upon procedural grounds.            Id.\n\n      The   Mississippi     Supreme   Court   found   Hansen\u2019s   ineffective\n\nassistance claims meritless.          Hansen, 649 So. 2d at 1257.        The\n\ncourt stated the issue was raised and rejected on direct appeal\n\n(there,     the   issue   concerned   an   ineffective    assistance   claim\n\npremised on claimed inadequate statutory attorney\u2019s fees); it then\n\nagreed with, and quoted, the ruling on direct appeal that \u201ccounsel\n\nhave pulled out all the stops, well exceeding the Strickland\n\nstandards\u201d.       Id. at 1259 (quoting Hansen, 592 So. 2d at 153;\n\nemphasis omitted).        Next, the court stated:      \u201cAgain, we conclude\n\nthere is no merit to these issues\u201d.           Id. (emphasis added).\n\n      Hansen\u2019s ineffective assistance claims were resolved on the\n\nmerits by the state court.       Therefore, the district court did not\n\nerr by applying \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to them.\n\n                                      B.\n\n      Hansen maintains his trial counsel was ineffective by failing\n\nat the penalty phase: to investigate mitigating evidence; and to\n\npresent psychological evidence concerning statutory mitigating\n\ncircumstances.      See MISS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 99-19-101(6).\n\n      To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Hansen must\n\nsatisfy the well known two prong standard:            counsel\u2019s performance\n\nwas   deficient,      falling    below     an    objective    standard    of\n\n\n                                       8\n\freasonableness;   and   this   deficient    performance   prejudiced   the\n\ndefense, such that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the outcome of the trial would\n\nhave been different. E.g., Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n687-88, 694 (1984).\n\n                                    1.\n\n     Regarding    the   claimed   failure   to   investigate   mitigating\n\nevidence, Hansen maintains counsel failed to prepare witnesses and\n\nto conduct an adequate investigation that would have uncovered\n\nevidence of the mental and physical abuse inflicted on Hansen\n\nduring his childhood (childhood abuse).2\n\n     The district court found counsel\u2019s investigation was not\n\ndeficient; affording the required \u201cheavy measure of deference\u201d to\n\ncounsel\u2019s strategic choices, it concluded: \u201ceven if he made a less\n\nthan complete investigation, the attorney\u2019s reasonable professional\n\njudgments support the limitations on investigation\u201d.        Hansen-USDC,\n\nat 19.    The court explained:           most of the seven mitigating\n\nwitnesses testified about Hansen\u2019s childhood abuse; and any missing\n\n\n\n     2\n      Hansen also asserts such an investigation could have\nuncovered additional mitigating evidence; in the district court,\nhowever, he contended only that the investigation would reveal\nevidence of his childhood abuse. We do not have jurisdiction to\nconsider aspects not presented in district court.      See, e.g.,\nGoodwin v. Johnson, 224 F.3d 450, 459 n.6 (5th Cir. 2000) (\u201cbefore\nwe may consider a petitioner\u2019s application for a COA on a\nparticular issue, that petitioner must first submit his request to\nthe district court and have that request denied\u201d), cert. denied,\n121 S. Ct. 874 (2001).\n\n                                    9\n\fdetails were not sufficient to render counsel\u2019s investigation\n\nunreasonable.     Id. at 20.\n\n      The district court also concluded that Hansen failed to show\n\nhis counsel did not adequately interview these witnesses.         Id.   It\n\nexplained: although, in his affidavit, Fred Weist (a social worker\n\nfrom a Florida prison where Hansen had been incarcerated) stated he\n\nnever spoke to Hansen\u2019s counsel about his testimony, he did not\n\npurport to have knowledge of Hansen\u2019s childhood; and, the other\n\nwitnesses\u2019 affidavits show Hansen\u2019s counsel interviewed them before\n\nthey testified.    Id.; cf. Leatherwood v. State, 473 So. 2d 964, 970\n\n(Miss. 1985) (defense counsel did not interview witnesses before\n\nthey testified).\n\n      In his habeas affidavit, Hansen\u2019s trial counsel stated he \u201cwas\n\nnot able to put forward [his] best effort for the sentencing phase\u201d\n\nor \u201cconduct in depth interviews of sentencing phase witnesses\u201d.\n\nThe   Sixth   Amendment   requires   counsel   to   provide   \u201creasonable\n\nprofessional services\u201d. Hansen-USDC, at 20-21 (quoting Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 687-88).           The district court concluded:       Hansen\n\nreceived such services during the penalty phase; and the testimony\n\nof witnesses not called would have been corroborative and largely\n\ncumulative.     Id. at 21.\n\n      Hansen has not shown reasonable jurists would disagree with\n\nthe district court.       Due to time pressure (his objection to the\n\ntrial date was overruled; sentencing began the day after the\n\n\n                                     10\n\fliability phase) and lack of investigative assistance (his request\n\nfor an investigator was denied), Hansen\u2019s attorney was limited in\n\nhis investigation, learning about Hansen\u2019s childhood abuse from\n\nHansen and relying upon Hansen to identify potential witnesses.\n\nSee Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691 (\u201c[W]hen the facts that support a\n\ncertain potential line of defense are generally known to counsel\n\nbecause of what the defendant has said, the need for further\n\ninvestigation    may   be   considerably   diminished    or   eliminated\n\naltogether\u201d.); cf. Armstrong v. Dugger, 833 F.2d 1430, 1432-33\n\n(11th Cir. 1987) (preparation for penalty phase consisted of\n\nmeeting once with petitioner, his mother and stepfather, and\n\nspeaking with his parole officer, the sole mitigating witness;\n\ncounsel explained lack of preparation not strategic but result of\n\ninexperience).\n\n     And, as noted, Hansen\u2019s attorney interviewed and called seven\n\nof those witnesses in mitigation, most of whom testified about\n\nHansen\u2019s childhood abuse.      For example, in response to questioning\n\nby Hansen\u2019s counsel, Hansen\u2019s father testified that Hansen\u2019s mother\n\n(who also testified) \u201ctook her unhappiness with [Hansen\u2019s father]\n\nout on [their] children\u201d.      When asked how she accomplished that,\n\nHansen\u2019s father answered:       \u201cThe kids had severe whippings with\n\nleather belts or sticks, whatever might be close\u201d.\n\n     In   the   alternative,   the   district   court   concluded   trial\n\ncounsel\u2019s claimed deficiencies did not prejudice Hansen.        Hansen-\n\n\n                                     11\n\fUSDC, at 22.      It goes without saying that, because Hansen has not\n\nshown reasonable jurists would find debatable or wrong the district\n\ncourt\u2019s assessment of Strickland\u2019s deficiency prong, we need not\n\nreach the prejudice prong.\n\n                                        2.\n\n     Hansen also claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing\n\nto present psychological mitigating evidence.                He asserts counsel\n\ndid not direct Dr. Matherne, the independent psychologist appointed\n\nto evaluate Hansen, to the statutory mitigating circumstances (for\n\nexample,   that    Hansen     committed      the   offense   while   \u201cunder   the\n\ninfluence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d or \u201cunder\n\nextreme duress or under the substantial domination of another\n\nperson\u201d,   as     discussed    infra;     or   that   Hansen\u2019s    capacity    \u201cto\n\nappreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct\n\nto the requirements of law was substantially impaired\u201d, see MISS.\n\nCODE ANN. \u00a7 99-19-101(6)(b), (e)-(f) (emphasis added)). Hansen also\n\nasserts counsel failed to direct Dr. Matherne to provide him with\n\nany information about Hansen, and ignored mitigating evidence that\n\nDr. Matherne could have developed regarding Hansen\u2019s personality\n\nand the likelihood he was under the substantial domination of\n\nKrecic.3\n\n\n     3\n      Hansen also asserts, for the first time on appeal, that\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to seek prison records that\nwould have revealed Hansen\u2019s prescriptions for psychiatric\nmedications. For the reasons previously stated, we cannot consider\nthis new issue. Goodwin, 224 F.3d at 459 n.6.\n\n                                        12\n\f     The   district      court     noted:        trial    counsel     reviewed    the\n\npsychological     report,     in    which      Dr.    Matherne     concluded   that,\n\nregarding Hansen\u2019s mental and emotional capacity at the time of the\n\nalleged offense, Hansen satisfied the M\u2019Naghten standard, see\n\nWestbrook v. State, 658 So. 2d 847, 850 (Miss. 1995) (ability to\n\nrealize and appreciate nature and quality of deeds when committed\n\nand distinguish between right and wrong); and, therefore, trial\n\ncounsel \u201cfelt it was not in [Hansen\u2019s] best interest that Dr.\n\nMatherne be called in this matter\u201d. The district court also noted:\n\ntrial   counsel   explained        he   \u201cdid    not    specifically      direct   Dr.\n\nMatherne to the mitigating circumstances listed in the capital\n\nsentencing statute\u201d, but \u201c[i]f Dr. Matherne had reported that he\n\ncould testify in support of mitigation, [he] would have called him\n\nas a witness in the sentencing phase\u201d.                   Hansen-USDC, at 23-24.\n\n     The district court concluded that, although trial counsel\n\ncomplained   that      time   limitations       deprived     him    of   a   thorough\n\ninvestigation     of    mitigating      psychological       factors,     \u201cstrategic\n\nchoices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable\n\nprecisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments\n\nsupport the limitations on investigation\u201d. Id. at 24 (quoting Loyd\n\nv. Whitley, 977 F.2d 149, 158 (5th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508\n\nU.S. 911 (1993), and Strickland, 466 U.S. at 681 (\u201c[l]imitations of\n\ntime and money ... may force early strategic choices, often based\n\nsolely on conversations with the defendant and a review of the\n\n\n                                         13\n\fprosecution\u2019s evidence\u201d)). \u201cIt is all too tempting for a defendant\n\nto second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse\n\nsentence\u201d, id.         (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689), where, as\n\nhere, the defense strategy was ultimately unsuccessful.                           That\n\nstrategy was urging jurors to vote for life imprisonment without\n\nparole (counsel advised the jury in closing argument for the\n\npenalty phase that Hansen confessed his prior convictions to the\n\ntrial court and wanted to be sentenced without the possibility of\n\nparole), for which counsel began to prepare well in advance of\n\ntrial, including moving for the court\u2019s permission to introduce\n\nevidence of Hansen\u2019s habitual criminal status.                   Cf. Williams, 529\n\nU.S. at 395 (counsel did not prepare for sentencing until week\n\nbefore trial).4\n\n       The    district      court    also   determined    that     Hansen   was   not\n\nprejudiced by any claimed deficiencies.                Hansen-USDC, at 25.        But,\n\nagain, because Hansen cannot show that reasonable jurists would\n\nfind       debatable   or    wrong    the   district     court\u2019s    assessment     of\n\nStrickland\u2019s deficiency prong on this issue, we need not reach the\n\nprejudice prong.\n\n                                            C.\n\n       4\n      Citing Lockett v. Anderson, 230 F.3d 695, 714 (5th Cir.\n2000), Hansen contends counsel should have been alerted by Dr.\nMatherne\u2019s test results that more investigation was needed. Hansen\ndid not raise this issue in the district court, asserting instead\nonly that Hansen\u2019s attorney was ineffective in failing to call Dr.\nMatherne at sentencing. We, thus, cannot consider this new claim.\nGoodwin, 224 F.3d at 459 n.6.\n\n                                            14\n\f      Hansen claims the district court held improperly that two of\n\nhis   claims   were    procedurally    barred   and,   alternatively,    were\n\nwithout merit:        that the State\u2019s suppression of a statement by\n\nBarbara Duncan, a cell mate of Krecic, violated Brady v. Maryland,\n\n373 U.S. 83 (1963), and Hansen\u2019s due process rights; and that,\n\nconcomitantly, the Brady violation rendered his trial counsel\n\nineffective.     Duncan\u2019s recorded and transcribed statement informed\n\nlaw enforcement officers that, inter alia, she overheard Krecic:\n\ntell a man, \u201cI am the one that killed ....\u201d; and tell others that\n\nHansen would do whatever Krecic said.\n\n      Hansen contends the district court erred:               by making no\n\nfinding   that    the    Mississippi       Supreme   Court   regularly   and\n\nconsistently applies the procedural bar in cases, such as this,\n\nwhere the underlying facts are outside the trial record and not\n\nreadily discoverable at time of trial; and by not considering\n\nDuncan\u2019s affidavit in determining whether the suppression of her\n\nstatement was material.\n\n      The district court applied the procedural bar found in \u00a7 99-\n\n39-21(1) of the Mississippi Code, concluding Hansen did not meet\n\nthe \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d or \u201cactual innocence\u201d exceptions because:\n\nhis counsel could have raised the claim on direct appeal; and\n\nHansen did not show that it is more likely than not that no\n\nreasonable juror would have found him guilty beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt in the light of all the evidence, including Krecic\u2019s alleged\n\n\n                                      15\n\fstatements overheard by Duncan.    Hansen-USDC, at 33; see MISS. CODE\n\nANN. \u00a7 99-39-21(1) (\u201cFailure by a prisoner to raise ... issues or\n\nerrors either in fact or law which were capable of determination at\n\ntrial and/or on direct appeal ... shall constitute a waiver thereof\n\nand shall be procedurally barred.\u201d)      In addition, the court also\n\nconsidered the merits of the Brady claim and held the exculpatory\n\nvalue provided by Duncan\u2019s statement was not sufficient, in the\n\nlight of all the contrary evidence, to undermine confidence in the\n\njury\u2019s verdict.   Hansen-USDC, at 40-41.\n\n                                  1.\n\n     In support of his contention that the Mississippi Supreme\n\nCourt does not consistently apply the \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar,\n\nenacted in 1984, Hansen cites Malone v. State, 486 So. 2d 367\n\n(Miss. 1986), and Read v. State, 430 So. 2d 832 (Miss. 1983).       In\n\nMalone, the petitioner, on application for post-conviction relief,\n\nasserted there was a plea bargain agreement between the prosecution\n\nand its star witness that had not been disclosed pre-trial.       486\n\nSo. 2d at 368.     Concluding the petitioner made a prima facie\n\nshowing there was such a plea agreement, the Mississippi Supreme\n\nCourt remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary\n\nhearing on the issue; the court did not cite, much less discuss,\n\nthe \u00a7 99-39-21(1) procedural bar.      Id. at 369.   We, thus, have no\n\nway of knowing whether the petitioner could have raised his Brady\n\nclaim on direct appeal.   Moreover, in Malone, the issue was whether\n\n                                  16\n\fthe plea bargain even existed pre-trial.       On the other hand,\n\nHansen\u2019s attorney knew about Duncan\u2019s statement in April 1988,\n\napproximately five months after trial and more than two years\n\nbefore he filed his direct appeal.\n\n     In Read, rendered prior to the enactment in 1984 of the \u00a7 99-\n\n39-21(1) procedural bar, the Mississippi Supreme Court concluded\n\nthat a petitioner is not precluded from raising an ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim in a post-conviction proceeding even\n\nthough he raised the same claim on appeal.   430 So. 2d at 841.   But\n\nin the case at hand, as noted by the district court, Hansen did not\n\nraise on appeal this ineffective assistance of counsel claim. And,\n\nalthough the procedural bar does not apply to an ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim when the petitioner is represented by\n\nthe same counsel at trial and on appeal, Martin v. Maxey, 98 F.3d\n\n844, 848 (5th Cir. 1996), Hansen does not contend his trial counsel\n\nwas ineffective as a result of his own error or omission; instead,\n\nHansen claims counsel was rendered ineffective by the State\u2019s\n\nsuppressing Duncan\u2019s statement.    Cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687.\n\n     Hansen has not shown Mississippi\u2019s procedural bar is not\n\nregularly applied to \u201cclasses of claims\u201d such as his.   Cf. Sones v.\n\nHargett, 61 F.3d 410, 417 (5th Cir. 1995).    Therefore, jurists of\n\nreason would not find it debatable whether the district court was\n\ncorrect in applying the bar.\n\n\n\n\n                                  17\n\f                                      2.\n\n      In the alternative, we consider Hansen\u2019s claim that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously: concluded trial counsel\u2019s strategy was\n\nnot adversely affected, particularly at the penalty phase; and\n\nrefused to consider Duncan\u2019s affidavit in determining whether the\n\nsuppression of her statement was material.                In support of this\n\nclaim, Hansen challenges the following decision by the district\n\ncourt to not consider Duncan\u2019s affidavit: \u201c[T]he transcript of the\n\ninterview [of Duncan] by the two officers is the subject of the\n\nBrady claim, not Duncan\u2019s affidavit statements.                Therefore, the\n\ncontents    of   the    affidavit   are     not    relevant   to   the   Court\u2019s\n\ndetermination\u201d.        Hansen-USDC, at 34.\n\n      Hansen asserts:       Duncan\u2019s affidavit demonstrates she would\n\nhave given testimony that Krecic manipulated Hansen; and this\n\nmitigating evidence is sufficient to undermine confidence in the\n\ndeath penalty imposed by the jury.                See MISS. CODE ANN. \u00a7 99-19-\n\n101(6)(e) (jury to consider as one of the mitigating factors\n\nwhether a defendant \u201cacted under extreme duress or under the\n\nsubstantial domination of another person\u201d).\n\n      To prevail under Brady, Hansen must show:            Duncan\u2019s statement\n\nwas   not   disclosed;     it   contained    favorable    evidence;      and   the\n\nevidence was \u201cmaterial\u201d.        E.g., Wilson v. Whitley, 28 F.3d 433, 435\n\n(5th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1091 (1995).               Evidence is\n\n\u201cmaterial\u201d if there is a reasonable probability that, had it been\n\n\n                                      18\n\fdisclosed, the result of the trial would have been different.                   Id.\n\nat 434. \u201cThe materiality of Brady material depends almost entirely\n\non the value of the evidence relative to the other evidence\n\nmustered by the state.\u201d            Id. at 439 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       The transcript included statements by Duncan:                    that she\n\noverheard Krecic tell others Hansen would do whatever Krecic said;\n\nand that, before Officer Ladner was shot, Krecic told Hansen to\n\n\u201c\u2018Shoot the bitch.       Shoot the bitch\u2019\u201d.           The district court found\n\nthat   any   mitigating    value     of    this      evidence   was   \u201cless   than\n\ncrystalline\u201d and not sufficient to undermine confidence in the\n\njury\u2019s verdict.        Id. at 41.     Furthermore, it concluded that any\n\nmitigating value was cumulative because other mitigating witnesses\n\nhad testified Krecic was \u201cthe leader\u201d of Hansen.                Id.\n\n       Regarding Hansen\u2019s contention that the district court erred by\n\nnot considering Duncan\u2019s affidavit regarding Krecic\u2019s manipulation\n\nof Hansen, the district court did consider this evidence and its\n\neffect on the verdict, albeit via the transcript of Duncan\u2019s\n\nearlier statement, rather than Duncan\u2019s affidavit.                Hansen has not\n\nshown that reasonable jurists would find debatable or wrong the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s assessment that the evidence was not material.\n\n                                          D.\n\n       Hansen   next    contends    that       the   district   court   erred   in\n\nupholding the exclusion of future-behavior-testimony by Fred Weist,\n\n\n                                          19\n\fthe social worker who counseled Hansen for several months between\n\nAugust 1981 and April 1982 (approximately five years before the\n\nmurder) at a prison in Florida, where Hansen was then incarcerated.\n\nIn Lockett v. Ohio, the Supreme Court held:\n\n          [T]he Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require\n          that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind\n          of capital case, not be precluded from\n          considering, as a mitigating factor, any\n          aspect of a defendant\u2019s character or record\n          and any of the circumstances of the offense\n          that the defendant proffers as a basis for a\n          sentence less than death.\n\n438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978) (emphasis in original; footnote omitted).\n\n     Specifically, Hansen asserts the district court misapplied\n\nSkipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1 (1986).   At issue in Skipper\n\nwas whether the exclusion of testimony regarding petitioner\u2019s good\n\nbehavior during his pre-trial time in jail deprived him of his\n\nright to present relevant mitigating evidence.     Id. at 4.   The\n\nCourt concluded such evidence could not be excluded.    Id. at 5.\n\n     At the penalty phase of Hansen\u2019s trial, the court sustained\n\nthe State\u2019s objections to questions regarding future events:   \u201cDo\n\nyou think [Hansen] would adapt well in prison life?\u201d; and \u201c[D]o you\n\nthink [Hansen] is treatable in any prison setting?\u201d.    Stating it\n\nwas overruling the State\u2019s objection to questions regarding past\n\nevents and, thus, admitting Weist\u2019s testimony as to Hansen\u2019s\n\npeaceful, helpful disposition during his previous incarcerations,\n\nthe trial court ruled that questioning Weist about future events\n\nwas speculative and invaded the province of the jury.\n\n                                20\n\f      The Mississippi Supreme Court agreed.           It did so on the basis\n\nthat the record failed to reflect Weist was qualified or accepted\n\nas an expert in predicting future behavior.             Hansen, 592 So. 2d at\n\n147 (citing MISS. R. EVID. 702).\n\n      The district court concluded that Skipper does not require the\n\ntrial court to admit speculative, opinion testimony by a non-expert\n\nwitness     concerning     a   petitioner\u2019s    future    behavior   in     jail.\n\nSkipper, 476 U.S. at 6 (\u201cDefense counsel was not offering opinion\n\ntestimony regarding future events.\u201d).\n\n      Hansen has not shown that reasonable jurists would find the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s ruling debatable or wrong.\n\n                                      E.\n\n      Hansen contends the district court misapplied the standard of\n\nBrecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 629, 638 (1993) (internal\n\nquotations omitted) (whether, for federal habeas relief purposes,\n\n\u201ctrial     error\u201d   constitutional       violation    \u201chad   substantial    and\n\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d),\n\nby   concluding     a    Confrontation     Clause    violation   nevertheless\n\nconstituted harmless error.\n\n      This contention concerns the following cross-examination of\n\nKrecic by the State:\n\n      Q.     Do you recall giving a statement to Sergeant Dean\n             Shephard in Gulfport, Mississippi on April the 11th of\n             this year [1987]?\n\n      A.     I\u2019m claiming the Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n                                      21\n\f      Q.

Do you remember that that answer was in response to the\n            question about who had shot the highway patrolman?\n\n      A.    I\u2019m claiming the Fifth Amendment.\n\nHansen contemporaneously objected.\n\n      On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled there had been\n\na   Confrontation    Clause    violation;    but,    applying   Chapman    v.\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), it concluded:          in the light of all\n\nthe evidence, the constitutional error was \u201charmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt\u201d.     Hansen, 592 So. 2d at 135-37.\n\n      Citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), the district court held the\n\nMississippi Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was neither contrary to, nor\n\ninvolved,   an   unreasonable    application   of,    clearly   established\n\nfederal law.     Hansen-USDC, at 12.        Agreeing that the State had\n\nviolated the Confrontation Clause, the district court performed its\n\nown harmless error review under the Brecht standard, and concluded:\n\n\u201cthe error did not result in actual prejudice and did not have a\n\n\u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the\n\njury\u2019s verdict\u2019\u201d.     Id. at 13 (quoting Brecht, 507 U.S. at 638).\n\nThe district court reasoned:          the questions regarding Krecic\u2019s\n\nalleged statement were few; the statement was exculpatory and did\n\nnot directly incriminate Hansen; and the \u201cstatement did not recite\n\n\u2018in   considerable    detail    the    circumstances     leading   to     and\n\n\n                                      22\n\fsurrounding the alleged crime\u2019 and did not provide a \u2018crucial link\n\nin the proof\u2019\u201d.     Id. (quoting Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415,\n\n417, 419 (1965)).\n\n     Moreover,    adopting   the   following   facts   found   by   the\n\nMississippi Supreme Court to be indicative of Hansen\u2019s guilt, the\n\ndistrict court determined that other evidence \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d\n\nsupported finding guilt:\n\n          To begin with, all of the evidence shows two\n          persons, a young man and a young woman, with\n          [State Trooper] Ladner along I-10 on the\n          evening of April 10, 1987.           Reasoning\n          backwards, we know Hansen was the man because\n          (a) Daisy Morgan identified Hansen as the man\n          who, a short while later, arrived with a\n          female companion in a Highway Patrol car, and\n          stole Morgan\u2019s Ford Ranger; (b) Pat Ladner\n          identified Hansen as the man who arrived at\n          his house later that evening with a female\n          companion; (c) Jody Wade and Charlie Williams\n          identified Hansen whom they took, with Krecic,\n          first to the Ladners\u2019 [home] and thereafter\n          toward Waveland; (d) State Troopers Freddie\n          Keel and Darryl Deschamp identified Hansen as\n          the man they took into custody while en route\n          to Waveland with Wade and Williams; and (e)\n          Critically, Troopers Keel and Deschamp found\n          on Hansen \u2014 some six hours after Ladner had\n          been shot \u2014 (1) the MHSP standard issue .357\n          Magnum which had been checked out to Ladner\n          and (2) a .38 caliber handgun \u2014 the bullet\n          removed from Ladner\u2019s neck had been fired from\n          a .38 caliber gun.\n\n               If this be not enough, we return to April\n          10\u2019s early evening hours and find that (f)\n          Kathy Romany, who had followed the blue town\n          car westward along I-10 all the way from\n          Florida, identified Hansen as the driver; (g)\n          William Forrest Runnels and Charles E.\n          Childress, both motorists passing by, said\n          they saw a blue town car, a state trooper\u2019s\n\n                                   23\n\f          car, and a man and a woman and, of importance,\n          that they saw the man stuffing a large pistol\n          into his pants; (h) Steve Diaz identified\n          Hansen as the man he saw standing over the\n          wounded and bleeding state trooper and as the\n          man who drove away in the trooper\u2019s car; and\n          (i) Paul Tibbetts and Donald Ray Meche each\n          made an in-court identification of Hansen as\n          the man who shot and killed Trooper Ladner.\n\n               If the cake need icing, (j) Clydell\n          Morgan testified that he found Hansen\u2019s left\n          thumbprint on the consent to search form,\n          Hansen\u2019s left little fingerprint on the map,\n          and a right palmprint on another incriminating\n          document. Add to this (k) the absence of the\n          slightest shred of evidence that Krecic pulled\n          the trigger, and we have in the record,\n          acceptable of consideration by reference to\n          the Court\u2019s instructions to the jury, evidence\n          that overwhelms.\n\nHansen-USDC, at 13-14 (alterations in original; quoting Hansen, 592\n\nSo. 2d at 136-37).\n\n     The district court concluded:    \u201cIn light of the record taken\n\nas a whole, the Court finds that the prosecution\u2019s violation of\n\n[Hansen\u2019s] rights under the Confrontation Clause did not have a\n\n\u2018substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the\n\njury\u2019s verdict\u2019\u201d.     Id. at 14 (quoting Brecht, 507 U.S. at 638).\n\nReasonable jurists would not find this application of       Brecht\n\ndebatable or wrong.    See Brecht, 507 U.S. at 638-39.5\n\n\n\n     5\n      In Tucker v. Johnson, 242 F.3d 617, 629 n.16 (5th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 2001 WL 744253 (5 Sep. 2001), our court noted the\ndoubt expressed regarding whether the Brecht standard is still\nviable post-enactment of AEDPA. The parties have not briefed the\nissue. In any event, because Hansen has not shown he is entitled\nto relief under either standard, we need not decide it. See id.\n\n                                 24\n\f                                      F.\n\n     Hansen\u2019s last claim is that he was entitled to an evidentiary\n\nhearing.\n\n                                      1.\n\n     Subject to the exceptions stated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2), if\n\na petitioner failed in state court to develop the factual basis of\n\na claim, the federal court may not hold an evidentiary hearing on\n\nthat claim.   Such failure is not established unless there is          \u201clack\n\nof diligence, or some greater fault, attributable to the prisoner\n\nor the prisoner\u2019s counsel\u201d. (Michael) Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S.\n\n420, 432 (2000).\n\n     Hansen contends that, in state court, he presented facts\n\nsupporting    the   following    claims:   (1)    his   trial   counsel   was\n\nineffective    in   failing     to   properly    investigate    and   present\n\nmitigating evidence; (2) his trial counsel was ineffective in\n\nfailing to present psychological evidence at the penalty phase; (3)\n\nthe State\u2019s refusal to provide his trial counsel with his Florida\n\nprison records violated Brady; and (4) the State\u2019s suppression of\n\nDuncan\u2019s statement violated Brady. (Each claim is discussed supra,\n\nexcept for (2), concerning prison records.)             The State does not\n\nassert that Hansen failed in state court to develop the factual\n\nbasis for these claims.\n\n     Nevertheless, citing McDonald v. Johnson, 139 F.3d 1056, 1058-\n\n60 (5th Cir. 1998), Hansen contends AEDPA\u2019s presumptions and\n\n\n                                      25\n\flimitations   concerning   state   court     findings   and   evidentiary\n\nhearings in district court do not apply when the state court does\n\nnot conduct an evidentiary hearing.         See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)\n\n(presumption of correctness accorded state court fact finding).\n\nHansen misreads McDonald; it stands for the proposition that a\n\npetitioner does not \u201cfail\u201d to develop a factual basis for his claim\n\nwhen a state court finds the claim procedurally barred.              The\n\nMississippi Supreme Court applied a procedural bar only to Hansen\u2019s\n\nclaim regarding the State\u2019s suppression of Duncan\u2019s statement; the\n\ncourt found the other claims meritless.\n\n     Hansen did request an evidentiary hearing in the state court\n\non the other claims.    Although \u201c[m]ere requests for evidentiary\n\nhearings will not suffice\u201d, Dowthitt v. Johnson, 230 F.3d 733, 758\n\n(5th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1250 (2001), Hansen was\n\ndiligent in procuring affidavits in support of each of his claims.\n\nCf. id.   Accordingly, Hansen did not fail in state court to develop\n\nthe factual basis of his claims.        Therefore, he was not precluded\n\nby \u00a7 2254(e)(2) from seeking an evidentiary hearing in district\n\ncourt.\n\n                                   2.\n\n     The denial of an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Clark v. Johnson, 227 F.3d 273, 284-85 (5th Cir.\n\n2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1129 (2001).            It goes without\n\nsaying that, when a district court has \u201csufficient facts before it\n\n\n                                   26\n\fto make an informed decision on the merits of [the petitioner\u2019s]\n\nclaim, it does not abuse its discretion in failing to conduct an\n\nevidentiary hearing\u201d.       Barrientes, 221 F.3d at 770 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).    To find an abuse of discretion, we must\n\nbe convinced that, if proven true, petitioner\u2019s allegations would\n\nentitle him to relief.    Clark v. Johnson, 202 F.3d 760, 766 (5th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 831 (2000).    The district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by denying an evidentiary hearing.\n\n                                  a.\n\n     As discussed supra, based upon our review of the record,\n\nincluding the exhibits submitted in support of his petition, we\n\nconclude that Hansen has alleged no fact which, if proved, would\n\nentitle him to relief on his ineffective assistance claims or his\n\nBrady claim regarding Duncan\u2019s statement.\n\n                                  b.\n\n       Regarding the other Brady claim (alleged suppression of\n\nHansen\u2019s Florida prison records), Hansen has not shown the district\n\ncourt erred in concluding the State was not under a duty to\n\ndisclose those records.      See Hansen-USDC, at 28 (citing United\n\nStates v. Ellender, 947 F.2d 748, 757 (5th Cir. 1991)).\n\n                                 III.\n\n     In sum, for each of his claims, Hansen has failed to make the\n\nshowing required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) for obtaining a COA:   he\n\nhas failed to demonstrate either that \u201creasonable jurists could\n\n                                  27\n\fdebate whether\u201d his habeas \u201cpetition should have been resolved\u201d\n\ndifferently or that the claims he has raised at least \u201cwere\n\nadequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further\u201d.

Accordingly, a COA\n\nis\n\n                                                         DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                               28\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "1839758460e0880ff374c817eabd6705053add0d", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/7479/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/10535/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/12226/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/14709/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/19786/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/21674/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/22191/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/23165/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/106598/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/107015/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/107359/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/109935/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111170/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111657/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112845/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118135/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118356/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118359/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145122/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/570509/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/592235/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/673440/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/727326/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/769776/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/770138/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/770280/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/770899/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1089530/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1093801/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1138476/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1723308/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1784754/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1829968/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2010-04-25T08:41:40Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 28, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/25655/hansen-v-armstrong/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "25655", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Hansen v.
