HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n        Federal habeas petitioner Felix Rocha confessed to the murder of Rafael\nFuentes\u2014a security guard found shot to death outside the Houston nightclub\nwhere he worked\u2014but later pled not guilty and proceeded to trial.         Texas\nindictments charged both Rocha and a co-defendant, Virgilio Maldonado, with\ncapital murder, though each defendant was tried separately. A jury convicted\nRocha and on its answer to the sentencing questions he was sentenced to death.\nState courts affirmed the conviction and sentence on direct review. Over the\n\f   Case: 05-70028       Document: 00511229088    Page: 2   Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\ncourse of the next eight years, Rocha filed four state habeas applications and one\nfederal habeas petition. All failed. The federal district court denied relief but\nheld an evidentiary hearing and granted Rocha a certificate of appealability\n(\u201cCOA\u201d) on his claim under Brady v. Maryland, a claim we now examine. Before\nthis court Rocha also renews his request for a COA on two additional questions:\nwhether he is entitled to review on the merits of his punishment-phase\nineffective assistance of counsel claim under Wiggins v. Smith; and whether the\nstate violated an individually-enforceable right under the Vienna Convention by\nfailing to inform Rocha that he was entitled, as a Mexican citizen, to contact his\ncountry\u2019s consulate. We affirm the district court, deny relief on Rocha\u2019s Brady\nclaim, and deny Rocha\u2019s request for a COA on his claim under the Vienna\nConvention. We also hold that Rocha was not entitled to have a federal court\nreview the merits of his Wiggins claim, but we grant his request for a COA on\nthat question.\n\n\n                                          I\n      Rocha\u2019s federal petition is subject to the heightened standard of review set\nout in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). In the\nreview of state proceedings, AEDPA proscribes federal habeas relief unless the\nstate court\u2019s adjudication on the merits (1) \u201cresulted in a decision that was\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\nfederal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or (2)\n\u201cresulted in a decision that was based upon an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.\u201d 1 \u201cA\nstate court decision is \u2018contrary to . . . clearly established precedent if the state\n\n\n      1\n          28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\n                                         2\n\f   Case: 05-70028         Document: 00511229088          Page: 3     Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\ncourt applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in [the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s] cases.\u2019\u201d2 \u201cA state-court decision will also be contrary to . . . clearly\nestablished precedent if the state court confronts a set of facts that are\nmaterially indistinguishable from a decision of [the Supreme Court] and\nnevertheless arrives at a result different from [Supreme Court] precedent.\u201d 3 \u201cA\nstate-court decision involves an unreasonable application of [Supreme Court]\nprecedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule from [the]\nCourt\u2019s cases but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state\nprisoner\u2019s case.\u201d4 AEDPA requires us to presume state-court findings of fact to\nbe correct \u201cunless the petitioner rebuts that presumption by clear and convincing\nevidence.\u201d5 We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its\nconclusions of law de novo, \u201capplying the same standards to the state court\u2019s\ndecision as did the district court.\u201d 6\n\n\n                                                II\n       After the state courts affirmed his conviction on direct and habeas review,\nRocha learned that one of the officers who had testified at his trial, Jaime\nEscalante, had a disciplinary record and was romantically involved with the\nsister of the lone eyewitness, Reynaldo Mu\u00f1oz.

Maryland.7 Rocha\nclaims he would have used the information to impeach the trial testimony of\nboth Officer Escalante and eyewitness Mu\u00f1oz. The district court, as we have\nnoted, denied relief but granted a COA. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of\nhabeas relief because the information was immaterial to the jury\u2019s decision to\nconvict.\n\n\n                                               A\n      A successful Brady claim has three elements: \u201cThe evidence at issue must\nbe favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is\nimpeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either\nwillfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d 8                     Rocha\nprocedurally defaulted on this claim by failing to present it in any of his four\nstate habeas petitions so in federal court he must demonstrate \u201ccause and\nprejudice\u201d to qualify for habeas relief, unless failure to do so would result in a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice.9               When a habeas petitioner brings a\nBrady claim, the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d requirements of the procedural default\ndoctrine parallel the last two elements of the alleged constitutional violation\nitself.10 That is, a petitioner shows \u201ccause\u201d when the reason for his failure to\ndevelop facts in state-court proceedings was the state\u2019s suppression of the\nrelevant evidence, while \u201cprejudice\u201d exists when the suppressed evidence is\n\n\n\n      7\n          See 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\n      8\n          Strickler v.

Our focus here is on materiality.\n\n\n                                       B\n      The parties do not dispute the relevant facts. At Rocha\u2019s trial\u2014again,\nconducted separately from co-defendant Maldonado\u2019s\u2014eyewitness Mu\u00f1oz\ntestified that he was checking on some coin-operated pool tables he owned at the\nnightclub when he saw two men\u2014one taller, and one shorter\u2014approach\nFuentes, the eventual victim. The taller of the two men lifted his arms as if to\npermit a frisk. According to Mu\u00f1oz, the shorter man then pointed a gun at\nFuentes before demanding and reaching for Fuentes\u2019s own holstered firearm.\nMu\u00f1oz fled the scene without seeing what happened next. He did, however, hear\ntwo or three gunshots as he ran. At Rocha\u2019s trial, Mu\u00f1oz identified Maldonado\nas the taller man who had approached Fuentes the night of the murder. Mu\u00f1oz\nnever pinned the murder on Rocha, saying only that his physical features \u201cfit[]\nthe description\u201d of the shorter man.\n      But the state\u2019s case against Rocha did not rise and fall on eyewitness\ntestimony\u2014Rocha had confessed. The prosecution sought to lay a foundation for\nthis confession through the testimony of Officer Escalante and a second police\nofficer, Xavier Avila. Escalante began by testifying that after the shooting he\n\u201cmade the scene\u201d at the nightclub.

Two days later, officers Escalante and\nAvila went to see Rocha and Maldonado in detention, suspecting that the\nattempted bank robbers also had something to do with the Fuentes murder.\nTheir hunch seemed to bear fruit: Rocha made an uncounseled waiver of his\nMiranda rights with both officers present but requested that they come back the\nnext day, at which time he would allow them to record his statement.\n       When the officers returned, they split up: Avila interviewed Rocha;\nEscalante took Maldonado. After about fifteen to thirty minutes, Maldonado\nconfessed to the murder and implicated Rocha. This success in hand, Escalante\ninterrupted Avila\u2019s interview with Rocha\u2014which up to this point had been\nunproductive\u2014to share the news.               He presented an audio recording of\nMaldonado\u2019s confession and prompted Avila to use a particular segment as a tool\nto speed Rocha\u2019s interview along. Avila, working alone, resumed his questioning\nof Rocha, eventually making an audio recording of Rocha\u2019s full confession.12\nEscalante took no direct part in Rocha\u2019s interview.\n       Escalante\u2019s trial testimony then turned to his interactions with eyewitness\n\n\n       12\n            On direct appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeals recounted Rocha\u2019s confession as\nfollows:\n\n       [Rocha] and Fuentes had been involved in an altercation at some time prior to the\n       murder. Fuentes had beaten and otherwise embarrassed [Rocha], and [Rocha] had\n       vowed to get revenge. On the night of the killing, [Rocha] and Maldonado confronted\n       Fuentes. [Rocha] intended to take Fuentes\u2019s gun to embarrass him and show that\n       Fuentes was not a good security guard. [Rocha] pulled his own gun on Fuentes, and\n       Fuentes grabbed [Rocha]\u2019s gun. Then [Rocha] and Fuentes struggled over [Rocha]\u2019s\n       gun, and [Rocha]\u2019s gun was shot once during the struggle. [Rocha] did not know\n       whether the shot hit Fuentes or simply went into the air. Maldonado shot Fuentes\n       several times to protect [Rocha]. Maldonado then took Fuentes\u2019[s] gun, and [Rocha] and\n       Maldonado fled the scene.\n\nRocha v. State, 16 S.W.3d at 5.\n\n                                              6\n\f   Case: 05-70028    Document: 00511229088      Page: 7    Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\nMu\u00f1oz. He explained that he first met Mu\u00f1oz during the investigation and that\nin November 1994 he showed Mu\u00f1oz two photo spreads, neither depicting\nMaldonado or Rocha. Mu\u00f1oz did not identify anyone on the two spreads, noting\nonly that two photos \u201clooked like\u201d the taller man. Much later, in 1997, Escalante\nagain showed Mu\u00f1oz a series of photographs\u2014this time with Maldonado\u2019s\nphotograph included. Mu\u00f1oz identified Maldonado as the taller of the two men\nwho had approached Fuentes.\n      Officer Avila\u2019s trial testimony confirmed Escalante\u2019s account of their initial\nvisit to Rocha. Avila testified in greater detail, answering questions regarding\nRocha\u2019s mental state, physical well-being, and apparent ability to understand his\nwaiver of Miranda rights. He then stepped the jury through his interrogation\nof Rocha.\n      On federal habeas review, the district court held an evidentiary hearing\nbefore rejecting Rocha\u2019s Brady claim; Mu\u00f1oz, Escalante, and others were\ndeposed. In his deposition, Escalante disclosed, for the first time, that he had\nfreelanced for the owner of the nightclub\u2014Maria Medeles\u2014during the Fuentes\ninvestigation and that their relationship had turned romantic by the time of\nRocha\u2019s trial. He testified that their professional relationship began sometime\nafter the murder when Medeles hired him as an apparent jack-of-all-trades for\nher area businesses. Only later did the relationship blossom into something\nmore. In seeming contrast to his trial testimony, Escalante also downplayed the\nlevel of his involvement in the Fuentes murder investigation, claiming, for\nexample, that he did not recall taking part in the initial crime scene\ninvestigation at all. Rather, he said his involvement began when the detectives\nhandling the case asked him, months after the murder, to contact eyewitness\nMu\u00f1oz through Medeles\u2014Escalante\u2019s part-time employer and paramour\u2014and,\nas it turns out, Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s sister:\n\n                                         7\n\f   Case: 05-70028    Document: 00511229088      Page: 8   Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\n\n      What happened, Avila couldn\u2019t get ahold of him, and he told me,\n      \u201cHey, tell Maria that we need to talk to her brother, show him a\n      photo spread, and I said, \u2018Well, give me the photo spread so I can\n      show it to him.\u2019 Maria tracked him down.\n\n      In his deposition, Escalante reiterated that he had first met Mu\u00f1oz during\nthe investigation and that he had seen Mu\u00f1oz only \u201cthree or four times.\u201d\nEscalante said he could not \u201cstand\u201d Mu\u00f1oz and that Medeles and Mu\u00f1oz were\nnot close, emphasizing that the siblings were related by adoption only.\nConsistent with testimony adduced at trial, Escalante confirmed that he had not\nbeen present for Rocha\u2019s confession but had provided Avila with the audio\nrecording of Maldonado\u2019s statement. In his federal petition, Rocha concedes\n\u201cEscalante is vague on when his relationship with Medeles began\u201d but asserts\nthat at a minimum Escalante \u201cknew Medeles well enough in 1994 to use her to\nfind her brother . . . during the investigation.\u201d\n      Escalante also admitted that he had been disciplined for running two\nbackground checks on Medeles and three on her son at their request, and that\nhe had retrieved the case number for a case involving the theft of items from\nMedeles\u2019s car. In response to these actions, the department suspended him for\nsix days in 2001 for unauthorized usage of police computer systems. It is not\nentirely clear when the department\u2019s investigation began, but Escalante first\ngave a statement on the subject in September 1999\u2014after Rocha\u2019s November\n1998 trial.\n      Adding to this milieu, Rocha rests his Brady claim in part on the\ndeposition testimony of Andres Reza, a former police officer who is currently\nserving a prison sentence on an unrelated conviction for kidnapping Medeles and\nholding her for ransom. Based on Reza\u2019s testimony, Rocha claims that the police\ndepartment\u2019s internal affairs division had long investigated Escalante\u2019s activities\n\n                                         8\n\f   Case: 05-70028            Document: 00511229088          Page: 9        Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\nand that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence of the following: (1)\nEscalante\u2019s suspected involvement in the murder of a Colombian victim; (2) his\nsuspected involvement in the drug trade; (3) a DEA investigation into his alleged\ndrug activities; (4) his suspected use of local cantinas in distributing drugs; (5)\nhis suspected involvement with a Colombian drug-trafficking network; and (6)\nhis suspected involvement in underage prostitution at the cantinas. Notably,\nRocha provides no corroboration for these allegations. Nor does he assign dates\nto any of the alleged incidents or investigations, explaining only that Escalante\u2019s\ndisciplinary history spanned 13 years and included seven sustained complaints.\nFor its part, the state identifies three internal department misconduct\ncomplaints filed prior to Rocha\u2019s trial, but the record admits no further detail.\n\n\n                                                    C\n          \u201cUnless suppressed evidence is \u2018material for Brady purposes, [its]\nsuppression [does] not give rise to sufficient prejudice to overcome [a] procedural\ndefault.\u2019\u201d13 \u201c[T]he materiality standard for Brady claims is met when \u2018the\nfavorable evidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a\ndifferent light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u2019\u201d14 Where, as here,\nthere are a number of potential Brady violations, \u201ca court must analyze whether\nthe cumulative effect of all such evidence suppressed by the government raises\na reasonable probability that its disclosure would have produced a different\nresult.\u201d 15\n\n          13\n          Banks v.

It is also undisputed that Escalante\nwas the subject of three sustained misconduct complaints prior to Rocha\u2019s trial.\n       Rocha contends that the state\u2019s failure to disclose this alleged\nimpeachment evidence tainted the testimony of both Escalante and Mu\u00f1oz. We\ncannot say that he is entirely wrong\u2014Escalante\u2019s credibility, for one, is strained\nto say the least.

On that score, it was Avila\u2014not\nEscalante\u2014who provided the meaningful detail about Rocha\u2019s confession; he was\nthe one, after all, who actually questioned Rocha. The remainder of Escalante\u2019s\ntestimony was largely irrelevant to the state\u2019s case. And at any rate Rocha does\nnot now contend that his full confession was anything but knowing and\nvoluntary,   so    neither   officer\u2019s   testimony   is   particularly   relevant     in\ndemonstrating Rocha\u2019s guilt.\n      Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s testimony also withstands Rocha\u2019s scrutiny, especially given the\nminimal impeachment value of the Escalante-Medeles-Mu\u00f1oz triangle.\nEscalante romanced Medeles; Escalante found Mu\u00f1oz through Medeles a few\nyears after the murder; Escalante presented a series of photographs and Mu\u00f1oz\nidentified Maldonado, Rocha\u2019s co-defendant; and Mu\u00f1oz later attested to that\nidentification, adding only that Rocha \u201cfit[] the description\u201d of the short man\npresent moments before Fuentes\u2019s murder. Without more, this narrative\u2014while\nno doubt curious\u2014is not compelling impeachment.               As the district court\nreasoned, \u201cMu\u00f1oz\u2019[s] relationship to Medeles does not establish that Mu\u00f1oz had\nany motive to lie about Rocha or anything else in this case. . . . [or] had any\nreason to frame Rocha or otherwise lie about who committed the murder.\u201d\n      A motive to lie or to frame is particularly difficult to fathom in light of the\nactual substance of Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s testimony, which reached Rocha\u2019s guilt tangentially\nat most. Mu\u00f1oz merely related that Rocha resembled the shorter man seen at\nthe nightclub the night of Fuentes\u2019s murder, and the balance of his\ntestimony\u2014like Escalante\u2019s account\u2014was only useful to the prosecution in\n\n                                          11\n\f  Case: 05-70028        Document: 00511229088          Page: 12     Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\ncorroborating the underlying facts of Rocha\u2019s full confession. That confession\nremains in evidence uncontested, strongly corroborating Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s supporting\ntestimony and rendering it largely superfluous.\n      Viewed as a whole, the \u201ctranscript falls far short of undermining\nconfidence in the guilt phase\u2019s outcome,\u201d19 and the undisclosed evidence is thus\nimmaterial for Brady purposes.\n\n\n                                              III\n        Rocha also requests a COA to address two additional issues, first, a\npunishment-phase ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and second, a charge\nthat the state violated his rights under the Vienna Convention.

Smith\u2014in the district court as\npart of his federal habeas petition.23 The court noted that Rocha did not raise\nthis claim in state court, making the claim unexhausted. Ordinarily, the district\ncourt observed, \u201ca federal habeas petition that contains unexhausted claims is\ndismissed without prejudice, allowing the petitioner to return to the state forum\nto present his unexhausted claims.\u201d However, \u201cif the court to which a petitioner\nmust present his claims to satisfy the exhaustion requirement would now find\nthe claims procedurally barred,\u201d the court need not dismiss his claims to allow\nexhaustion. The district court concluded that Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim would be\nprocedurally barred in Texas court, and that Rocha was unable to show cause for\nor prejudice from a procedural default or that he was actually innocent of capital\nmurder or the death penalty. Accordingly, the district court held that Rocha\u2019s\nWiggins claim was procedurally barred from review in federal court and denied\nhim habeas relief.24\n       With his appeal pending before our court, Rocha filed a subsequent state\nhabeas application to exhaust his Wiggins claim. Rocha also moved for\u2014and\nobtained\u2014a stay of the federal appellate proceedings until the Texas Court of\n\n\n       23\n          See 539 U.S. 510 (2003). As part of his initial habeas petition, Rocha also asserted\nthat his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to discover and use impeachment evidence\nconcerning Escalante and Mu\u00f1oz. He has since abandoned this claim.\n       24\n          After the district court denied his federal habeas petition and before Rocha filed his\nnotice of appeal, Rocha filed a motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s judgment on his\nBrady claim and a motion for a COA on his Vienna Convention claim. At that time, Rocha did\nnot file a motion for post-judgment relief on his Wiggins claim.\n\n                                              13\n\f  Case: 05-70028          Document: 00511229088          Page: 14     Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\nCriminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) ruled on Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim. The CCA eventually\ndismissed Rocha\u2019s claim, after briefly reciting the procedural history, in an\nunsigned per curiam order:\n       We have reviewed the application and find that the allegations do\n       not satisfy the requirements of Article 11.071, Section 5(a)(3).\n       Therefore, we dismiss this application as an abuse of the writ.25\n       Rocha then returned to federal district court and filed a motion to reopen\nthe district court\u2019s final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)\nfor further evaluation of his Wiggins claim. Rocha asserted that the CCA had\nreached the merits of his Wiggins claim, thus permitting federal habeas review.\nRocha also moved for another stay and limited remand in the Fifth Circuit to\nallow the district court to consider Rocha\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. While Rocha\u2019s\nmotion to stay the proceedings and for limited remand was pending, the district\ncourt denied Rocha\u2019s motion for Rule 60(b) relief and denied Rocha\u2019s application\nfor a COA. The district court denied Rocha\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for relief from\njudgment because it concluded that the CCA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 5(a)(3) was an\nindependent and adequate state ground, leaving intact its original conclusion\nthat Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim was procedurally barred.\n       Rocha appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion to this\ncourt.26 We denied as moot Rocha\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings and for\n\n\n       25\n            See TEX .

We have jurisdiction to consider the\ndenial of a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas proceeding only if the motion \u201cattacks, not the\nsubstance of the federal court\u2019s resolution of the claim on the merits, but some defect in the\nintegrity of the federal habeas proceedings.\u201d Gonzales v.

In his briefing before\nthe district court, Rocha asserted that he was entitled to relief under both Rule 60(b)(5) and\n(6). Rule 60(b)(5) vests a court with the authority to grant relief from a final judgment, order,\nor proceeding if \u201cthe judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an\nearlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer\nequitable.\u201d FED .

Accordingly, Rocha\u2019s claim for relief under Rule 60(b) is\nproperly analyzed under subsection (6). See Bailey v.

Rather, Mr. Rocha has argued\nthat the [CCA\u2019s] decision disposing of Mr. Rocha\u2019s subsequent habeas application is not\nindependent because: (1) the dismissal rests on a ground (specifically, Tex.

Furthermore, on direct review\nand in the non-death penalty context, the Supreme Court has suggested that where a state\ncourt does not actually reach the underlying merits, the independence of the state procedural\nrule is not automatically undermined by the mere existence of provisions requiring or\nempowering the state court to excuse procedural defaults if the underlying error is \u201cplain\u201d or\n\u201cfundamental.\u201d See Sochor v.

Balentine first relied on Ruiz to conclude that a bare citation to \u00a7 5\nis not a clear and express statement that the decision rests on an independent and adequate\nstate-law ground. See id. at 735-38. It then proceeded to consider the merits of the underlying\nclaim. See id. at 738-43. To the extent that our decision today is not fully consonant with the\ndecision in Balentine, we believe that dissonance stems from Balentine\u2019s misapplication of our\ndecision in Ruiz. The mandate has yet to issue in Balentine, and a petition for rehearing en\nbanc remains pending. We therefore instruct the clerk of the court that the mandate in this\ncase shall not issue until the mandate has issued in Balentine.\n\n                                              23\n\f  Case: 05-70028         Document: 00511229088          Page: 24     Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\n       Here, Rocha cannot make the requisite showing under this shared\nstandard. When a claim of actual innocence contests a sentence of death, the\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s claim must tend to negate not just the jury\u2019s discretion to\nimpose a death sentence but the petitioner\u2019s very eligibility for that punishment.\nThat is, a habeas petitioner who is \u201cunquestionably eligible\u201d for the sentence\nreceived can never be \u201cactually innocent of the death penalty.\u201d 65 This is so\nbecause late-arriving constitutional error that impacted only a jury\u2019s sentencing\ndiscretion is not \u201csufficiently fundamental as to excuse the failure to raise it\ntimely in prior state and federal proceedings.\u201d66                  \u201c[T]he \u2018actual innocence\u2019\nrequirement must,\u201d then, \u201cfocus on those elements that render a defendant\neligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating evidence that was\nprevented from being introduced as a result of a claimed constitutional error.\u201d 67\n       But that is just the sort of evidence Rocha presents here. His Wiggins\nclaim reduces to an assertion that mitigating evidence could have influenced the\njury\u2019s discretion in considering a sentence of death; he does not argue that this\nevidence would have rendered him ineligible for the death penalty. A Wiggins\nclaim by its operation in this case goes only to a jury\u2019s discretion in meting out\nthe penalty of death, not a particular defendant\u2019s eligibility for that\npunishment.68\n       That said, a caveat is necessary.

Putting\naside the low probability that any court would resolve sub rosa an issue it had\nvery recently and explicitly left unanswered, we must at any rate conclude that\nthe CCA relied on federal law in making its decision. Hitched to the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s teachings in Sawyer, bare citation to \u00a7 5(a)(3)\u2014without more\u2014\u201cfairly\nappears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law,\u201d 71\nnamely the federal actual innocence standard, and there is no clear and express\nbasis to say otherwise.72 Accordingly, we must \u201caccept as the most reasonable\nexplanation that the state court decided the case the way it did because it\nbelieved that federal law required it to do so.\u201d73 And federal law under Sawyer\nprecludes Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim.\n      Seen generally, the district court\u2019s conclusion\u2014that Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim\nis of no help to him given the procedural posture of his case and the contours of\nstate law\u2014was correct. However, given Balentine and its newly minted reading,\nreasonable jurists could debate whether Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim fails because\n\u00a7 5(a)(3) operates as an independent and adequate state ground and Rocha\ncannot make the showing of actual innocence of the death penalty that is\nrequired to overcome a state-law procedural bar, or his Wiggins claim fails\nbecause his claim of actual innocence under \u00a7 5(a)(3) fails on the merits.\nTherefore, a COA will issue on this question.

The federal district court also denied relief, explaining that Article 36\ndid not create individually-enforceable rights.76\n       Rocha acknowledges we have held that Article 36 does not create\nindividually-enforceable rights but wants a COA so that he may pursue en banc\n\n\n\n       74\n            463 U.S. 1032.\n       75\n            501 U.S. 722.\n       76\n           The district court also observed that the International Court of Justice (\u201cICJ\u201d) has\nalready determined that Rocha\u2019s rights under the treaty were not substantively violated.\nWhile it is true that the ICJ refused to find that Mexico\u2019s right to \u201carrange for [Rocha\u2019s] legal\nrepresentation\u201d had not been violated, it found that the state violated the Convention when\nit failed to inform Rocha of his right to request that the authorities inform his government\u2019s\nconsulate that he had been detained.

Thaler, 609 F.3d 729\n(5th Cir. 2010), as well as other decisions of this court.\n      In Balentine, we addressed a case with an almost identical procedural\nposture and reversed the district court\u2019s denial of the habeas petitioner\u2019s Rule\n60(b) motion as an abuse of discretion. We concluded that a Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals\u2019s decision denying habeas relief on a successive petition did\nnot rest upon an independent state-law ground because \u201cthat denial could have\nbeen a decision that the facts were previously available and no excuse from\npresenting the claim earlier existed\u2014an adequate and independent state\nground\u2014or that denial could have been based on a finding that the facts as\nalleged did not indicate a federal constitutional violation.\u201d 609 F.3d at 737.\nBecause the basis for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision could have\nrested on a finding that the petitioner failed to allege facts establishing a federal\nconstitutional violation\u2014a question of federal constitutional law\u2014the court\nconcluded that Balentine was entitled to have a federal court review the merits\nof his Wiggins claim.

Here, the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals\u2019s decision rested upon a finding that Rocha\u2019s allegations \u201cdo not satisfy\nthe requirements of Article 11.071, Section 5(a)(3).\u201d Under our decisions in\nBalentine and Ruiz, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision\u2014relying on\n\u00a7 5(a)(3), which incorporates federal constitutional law\u2014was based on the merits\nof Rocha\u2019s federal constitutional claim rather than an independent state-law\nground. Balentine, 609 F.3d at 738 (\u201c[A] ruling that the facts, if established, did\nnot constitute a violation would also be \u2018interwoven\u2019 with federal constitutional\nlaw.\u201d); Ruiz, 504 F.3d at 527 (\u201cThe boilerplate dismissal by the CCA of an\napplication for abuse of the writ is itself uncertain on this point, being unclear\nwhether the CCA decision was based on the first element [whether the factual\nor legal basis for the subsequent claim was previously unavailable], a state-law\nquestion, or on the second element [whether the facts alleged would establish a\nfederal constitutional violation], a question of federal constitutional law.\u201d). In\nshort, our prior decisions in Balentine and Ruiz suggest that the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals\u2019s decision in this case was merits-based rather than\nprocedural, entitling Rocha to federal merits review of his Wiggins claim.\n      The majority opinion does not attempt to reconcile today\u2019s result with our\nprior holding in Balentine, and it does not fully reconcile this case with Ruiz,\nHughes,1 and Rivera.2 Instead, the majority opinion instructs the clerk of the\ncourt to hold the mandate in this case because a petition for rehearing en banc\nhas been filed in Balentine. The majority opinion\u2019s approach is collegial but\ncontrary to the circuit\u2019s rule that one panel cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s\ndecision in the absence of an intervening or superseding decision by the United\nStates Supreme Court or a decision by this court sitting en banc.

Because this court\u2019s prior\ndecisions in Balentine and Ruiz have not been overruled or altered as of this\ndate, we are bound to follow those decisions.\n       Our court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area\u2014including Balentine, Ruiz, Hughes,\nand Rivera\u2014creates confusion as to the precise language that will be considered\nto be \u201can independent and adequate state ground\u201d in cases where the state court\ndoes not elaborate on its reasoning. En banc consideration of Balentine (perhaps\ntogether with this case) may very well be appropriate but, as of this time, the\ncourt has yet to take that action, and Ruiz and Balentine remain controlling\nprecedent. In the meantime, at a minimum, it makes little sense to hold the\nmandate in this case while denying the parties full briefing and possibly further\noral argument on this issue. I would, at the very least, allow full briefing by the\nparties before deciding the merits of the procedural default question and, if\nappropriate, the merits of the Wiggins claim.3\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         The majority opinion states that the issue of whether Rocha is entitled to federal\nmerits review has already been\u201cfully briefed and squarely addressed\u201d by the parties at oral\nargument. But oral argument in this case was heard on June 14, 2010, and the Balentine\ndecision was not released until June 18, 2010. Thus, the parties could not have fully briefed\nand argued the impact of Balentine on the instant case because that decision had not yet been\nreleased. While the parties did submit letters pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 28(j) addressing the impact of Balentine, they did not get the benefit of full briefing\nor the opportunity to address the majority opinion\u2019s novel interpretation of \u00a7 5(a)(3). Indeed,\nno other federal appellate court to date has applied this approach in such a situation.\nAccordingly, I conclude that this case would benefit from full briefing on whether, under\nBalentine, Ruiz, or the approach set forth in the majority opinion, federal merits review of\nRocha\u2019s Wiggins claim is appropriate.\n\n                                               32\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">     Case: 05-70028   Document: 00511229088   Page: 1   Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\n\n          IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                   FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT  United States Court of Appeals\n                                                   Fifth Circuit\n\n                                                FILED\n                                                              September 9, 2010\n\n                          Nos. 05-70028 and 09-70018             Lyle W.

Texas\nindictments charged both Rocha and a co-defendant, Virgilio Maldonado, with\ncapital murder, though each defendant was tried separately.

All failed. The federal district court denied relief but\nheld an evidentiary hearing and granted Rocha a certificate of appealability\n(\u201cCOA\u201d) on his claim under Brady v. Maryland, a claim we now examine. Before\nthis court Rocha also renews his request for a COA on two additional questions:\nwhether he is entitled to review on the merits of his punishment-phase\nineffective assistance of counsel claim under Wiggins v. Smith; and whether the\nstate violated an individually-enforceable right under the Vienna Convention by\nfailing to inform Rocha that he was entitled, as a Mexican citizen, to contact his\ncountry\u2019s consulate. We affirm the district court, deny relief on Rocha\u2019s Brady\nclaim, and deny Rocha\u2019s request for a COA on his claim under the Vienna\nConvention.

The district court, as we have\nnoted, denied relief but granted a COA. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of\nhabeas relief because the information was immaterial to the jury\u2019s decision to\nconvict.\n\n\n                                               A\n      A successful Brady claim has three elements: \u201cThe evidence at issue must\nbe favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is\nimpeaching; that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either\nwillfully or inadvertently; and prejudice must have ensued.\u201d 8                     Rocha\nprocedurally defaulted on this claim by failing to present it in any of his four\nstate habeas petitions so in federal court he must demonstrate \u201ccause and\nprejudice\u201d to qualify for habeas relief, unless failure to do so would result in a\nfundamental miscarriage of justice.9               When a habeas petitioner brings a\nBrady claim, the \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d requirements of the procedural default\ndoctrine parallel the last two elements of the alleged constitutional violation\nitself.10 That is, a petitioner shows \u201ccause\u201d when the reason for his failure to\ndevelop facts in state-court proceedings was the state\u2019s suppression of the\nrelevant evidence, while \u201cprejudice\u201d exists when the suppressed evidence is\n\n\n\n      7\n          See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963).\n      8\n          Strickler v.

At Rocha\u2019s trial\u2014again,\nconducted separately from co-defendant Maldonado\u2019s\u2014eyewitness Mu\u00f1oz\ntestified that he was checking on some coin-operated pool tables he owned at the\nnightclub when he saw two men\u2014one taller, and one shorter\u2014approach\nFuentes, the eventual victim. The taller of the two men lifted his arms as if to\npermit a frisk. According to Mu\u00f1oz, the shorter man then pointed a gun at\nFuentes before demanding and reaching for Fuentes\u2019s own holstered firearm.\nMu\u00f1oz fled the scene without seeing what happened next. He did, however, hear\ntwo or three gunshots as he ran. At Rocha\u2019s trial, Mu\u00f1oz identified Maldonado\nas the taller man who had approached Fuentes the night of the murder. Mu\u00f1oz\nnever pinned the murder on Rocha, saying only that his physical features \u201cfit[]\nthe description\u201d of the shorter man.\n      But the state\u2019s case against Rocha did not rise and fall on eyewitness\ntestimony\u2014Rocha had confessed. The prosecution sought to lay a foundation for\nthis confession through the testimony of Officer Escalante and a second police\nofficer, Xavier Avila. Escalante began by testifying that after the shooting he\n\u201cmade the scene\u201d at the nightclub. There he interviewed \u201cfive or six Spanish-\nspeaking witnesses.\u201d From then on he \u201c[took] charge . . . of investigating leads\nand following up on things [he] learned during that initial visit.\u201d\n      Escalante\u2019s testimony continued: With no arrests made nearly a year and\n\n\n      11\n           Id.\n\n                                        5\n\f   Case: 05-70028        Document: 00511229088        Page: 6    Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\na half after the murder, police arrested Rocha and Maldonado on unrelated bank\nrobbery and capital murder charges. Two days later, officers Escalante and\nAvila went to see Rocha and Maldonado in detention, suspecting that the\nattempted bank robbers also had something to do with the Fuentes murder.\nTheir hunch seemed to bear fruit: Rocha made an uncounseled waiver of his\nMiranda rights with both officers present but requested that they come back the\nnext day, at which time he would allow them to record his statement.\n       When the officers returned, they split up: Avila interviewed Rocha;\nEscalante took Maldonado. After about fifteen to thirty minutes, Maldonado\nconfessed to the murder and implicated Rocha. This success in hand, Escalante\ninterrupted Avila\u2019s interview with Rocha\u2014which up to this point had been\nunproductive\u2014to share the news.               He presented an audio recording of\nMaldonado\u2019s confession and prompted Avila to use a particular segment as a tool\nto speed Rocha\u2019s interview along. Avila, working alone, resumed his questioning\nof Rocha, eventually making an audio recording of Rocha\u2019s full confession.12\nEscalante took no direct part in Rocha\u2019s interview.\n       Escalante\u2019s trial testimony then turned to his interactions with eyewitness\n\n\n       12\n            On direct appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeals recounted Rocha\u2019s confession as\nfollows:\n\n       [Rocha] and Fuentes had been involved in an altercation at some time prior to the\n       murder. Fuentes had beaten and otherwise embarrassed [Rocha], and [Rocha] had\n       vowed to get revenge. On the night of the killing, [Rocha] and Maldonado confronted\n       Fuentes. [Rocha] intended to take Fuentes\u2019s gun to embarrass him and show that\n       Fuentes was not a good security guard. [Rocha] pulled his own gun on Fuentes, and\n       Fuentes grabbed [Rocha]\u2019s gun. Then [Rocha] and Fuentes struggled over [Rocha]\u2019s\n       gun, and [Rocha]\u2019s gun was shot once during the struggle. [Rocha] did not know\n       whether the shot hit Fuentes or simply went into the air. Maldonado shot Fuentes\n       several times to protect [Rocha]. Maldonado then took Fuentes\u2019[s] gun, and [Rocha] and\n       Maldonado fled the scene.\n\nRocha v. State, 16 S.W.3d at 5.\n\n                                              6\n\f   Case: 05-70028    Document: 00511229088      Page: 7    Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\nMu\u00f1oz. He explained that he first met Mu\u00f1oz during the investigation and that\nin November 1994 he showed Mu\u00f1oz two photo spreads, neither depicting\nMaldonado or Rocha. Mu\u00f1oz did not identify anyone on the two spreads, noting\nonly that two photos \u201clooked like\u201d the taller man. Much later, in 1997, Escalante\nagain showed Mu\u00f1oz a series of photographs\u2014this time with Maldonado\u2019s\nphotograph included. Mu\u00f1oz identified Maldonado as the taller of the two men\nwho had approached Fuentes.\n      Officer Avila\u2019s trial testimony confirmed Escalante\u2019s account of their initial\nvisit to Rocha. Avila testified in greater detail, answering questions regarding\nRocha\u2019s mental state, physical well-being, and apparent ability to understand his\nwaiver of Miranda rights. He then stepped the jury through his interrogation\nof Rocha.\n      On federal habeas review, the district court held an evidentiary hearing\nbefore rejecting Rocha\u2019s Brady claim; Mu\u00f1oz, Escalante, and others were\ndeposed. In his deposition, Escalante disclosed, for the first time, that he had\nfreelanced for the owner of the nightclub\u2014Maria Medeles\u2014during the Fuentes\ninvestigation and that their relationship had turned romantic by the time of\nRocha\u2019s trial. He testified that their professional relationship began sometime\nafter the murder when Medeles hired him as an apparent jack-of-all-trades for\nher area businesses. Only later did the relationship blossom into something\nmore. In seeming contrast to his trial testimony, Escalante also downplayed the\nlevel of his involvement in the Fuentes murder investigation, claiming, for\nexample, that he did not recall taking part in the initial crime scene\ninvestigation at all. Rather, he said his involvement began when the detectives\nhandling the case asked him, months after the murder, to contact eyewitness\nMu\u00f1oz through Medeles\u2014Escalante\u2019s part-time employer and paramour\u2014and,\nas it turns out, Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s sister:\n\n                                         7\n\f   Case: 05-70028    Document: 00511229088      Page: 8   Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\n\n      What happened, Avila couldn\u2019t get ahold of him, and he told me,\n      \u201cHey, tell Maria that we need to talk to her brother, show him a\n      photo spread, and I said, \u2018Well, give me the photo spread so I can\n      show it to him.\u2019 Maria tracked him down.\n\n      In his deposition, Escalante reiterated that he had first met Mu\u00f1oz during\nthe investigation and that he had seen Mu\u00f1oz only \u201cthree or four times.\u201d\nEscalante said he could not \u201cstand\u201d Mu\u00f1oz and that Medeles and Mu\u00f1oz were\nnot close, emphasizing that the siblings were related by adoption only.\nConsistent with testimony adduced at trial, Escalante confirmed that he had not\nbeen present for Rocha\u2019s confession but had provided Avila with the audio\nrecording of Maldonado\u2019s statement. In his federal petition, Rocha concedes\n\u201cEscalante is vague on when his relationship with Medeles began\u201d but asserts\nthat at a minimum Escalante \u201cknew Medeles well enough in 1994 to use her to\nfind her brother . . . during the investigation.\u201d\n      Escalante also admitted that he had been disciplined for running two\nbackground checks on Medeles and three on her son at their request, and that\nhe had retrieved the case number for a case involving the theft of items from\nMedeles\u2019s car. In response to these actions, the department suspended him for\nsix days in 2001 for unauthorized usage of police computer systems. It is not\nentirely clear when the department\u2019s investigation began, but Escalante first\ngave a statement on the subject in September 1999\u2014after Rocha\u2019s November\n1998 trial.\n      Adding to this milieu, Rocha rests his Brady claim in part on the\ndeposition testimony of Andres Reza, a former police officer who is currently\nserving a prison sentence on an unrelated conviction for kidnapping Medeles and\nholding her for ransom.

On that score, it was Avila\u2014not\nEscalante\u2014who provided the meaningful detail about Rocha\u2019s confession; he was\nthe one, after all, who actually questioned Rocha. The remainder of Escalante\u2019s\ntestimony was largely irrelevant to the state\u2019s case. And at any rate Rocha does\nnot now contend that his full confession was anything but knowing and\nvoluntary,   so    neither   officer\u2019s   testimony   is   particularly   relevant     in\ndemonstrating Rocha\u2019s guilt.\n      Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s testimony also withstands Rocha\u2019s scrutiny, especially given the\nminimal impeachment value of the Escalante-Medeles-Mu\u00f1oz triangle.\nEscalante romanced Medeles; Escalante found Mu\u00f1oz through Medeles a few\nyears after the murder; Escalante presented a series of photographs and Mu\u00f1oz\nidentified Maldonado, Rocha\u2019s co-defendant; and Mu\u00f1oz later attested to that\nidentification, adding only that Rocha \u201cfit[] the description\u201d of the short man\npresent moments before Fuentes\u2019s murder. Without more, this narrative\u2014while\nno doubt curious\u2014is not compelling impeachment.               As the district court\nreasoned, \u201cMu\u00f1oz\u2019[s] relationship to Medeles does not establish that Mu\u00f1oz had\nany motive to lie about Rocha or anything else in this case. . . . [or] had any\nreason to frame Rocha or otherwise lie about who committed the murder.\u201d\n      A motive to lie or to frame is particularly difficult to fathom in light of the\nactual substance of Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s testimony, which reached Rocha\u2019s guilt tangentially\nat most. Mu\u00f1oz merely related that Rocha resembled the shorter man seen at\nthe nightclub the night of Fuentes\u2019s murder, and the balance of his\ntestimony\u2014like Escalante\u2019s account\u2014was only useful to the prosecution in\n\n                                          11\n\f  Case: 05-70028        Document: 00511229088          Page: 12     Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\ncorroborating the underlying facts of Rocha\u2019s full confession. That confession\nremains in evidence uncontested, strongly corroborating Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s supporting\ntestimony and rendering it largely superfluous.\n      Viewed as a whole, the \u201ctranscript falls far short of undermining\nconfidence in the guilt phase\u2019s outcome,\u201d19 and the undisclosed evidence is thus\nimmaterial for Brady purposes.\n\n\n                                              III\n        Rocha also requests a COA to address two additional issues, first, a\npunishment-phase ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and second, a charge\nthat the state violated his rights under the Vienna Convention.

Ordinarily, the district\ncourt observed, \u201ca federal habeas petition that contains unexhausted claims is\ndismissed without prejudice, allowing the petitioner to return to the state forum\nto present his unexhausted claims.\u201d However, \u201cif the court to which a petitioner\nmust present his claims to satisfy the exhaustion requirement would now find\nthe claims procedurally barred,\u201d the court need not dismiss his claims to allow\nexhaustion. The district court concluded that Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim would be\nprocedurally barred in Texas court, and that Rocha was unable to show cause for\nor prejudice from a procedural default or that he was actually innocent of capital\nmurder or the death penalty. Accordingly, the district court held that Rocha\u2019s\nWiggins claim was procedurally barred from review in federal court and denied\nhim habeas relief.24\n       With his appeal pending before our court, Rocha filed a subsequent state\nhabeas application to exhaust his Wiggins claim.

As part of his initial habeas petition, Rocha also asserted\nthat his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to discover and use impeachment evidence\nconcerning Escalante and Mu\u00f1oz. He has since abandoned this claim.\n       24\n          After the district court denied his federal habeas petition and before Rocha filed his\nnotice of appeal, Rocha filed a motion to alter or amend the district court\u2019s judgment on his\nBrady claim and a motion for a COA on his Vienna Convention claim. At that time, Rocha did\nnot file a motion for post-judgment relief on his Wiggins claim.\n\n                                              13\n\f  Case: 05-70028          Document: 00511229088          Page: 14     Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\nCriminal Appeals (\u201cCCA\u201d) ruled on Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim.

Rocha asserted that the CCA had\nreached the merits of his Wiggins claim, thus permitting federal habeas review.\nRocha also moved for another stay and limited remand in the Fifth Circuit to\nallow the district court to consider Rocha\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. While Rocha\u2019s\nmotion to stay the proceedings and for limited remand was pending, the district\ncourt denied Rocha\u2019s motion for Rule 60(b) relief and denied Rocha\u2019s application\nfor a COA. The district court denied Rocha\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion for relief from\njudgment because it concluded that the CCA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 5(a)(3) was an\nindependent and adequate state ground, leaving intact its original conclusion\nthat Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim was procedurally barred.\n       Rocha appealed the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion to this\ncourt.26 We denied as moot Rocha\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings and for\n\n\n       25\n            See TEX .

Although\nRocha\u2019s brief at times appears to contest both the independent and adequate nature of \u00a7 5, his\nresponse to the state\u2019s Rule 28(j) letter clearly disavows any claim that \u00a7 5 is inadequate: \u201cMr.\nRocha has argued in his application for a Certificate of Appealability that he is entitled to\nfederal review because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 . . . decision did not rest on an\nindependent state ground. He has not made any argument that discretion in the [CCA\u2019s]\njudgment renders it inadequate and requires federal review. Rather, Mr. Rocha has argued\nthat the [CCA\u2019s] decision disposing of Mr. Rocha\u2019s subsequent habeas application is not\nindependent because: (1) the dismissal rests on a ground (specifically, Tex.

Balentine first relied on Ruiz to conclude that a bare citation to \u00a7 5\nis not a clear and express statement that the decision rests on an independent and adequate\nstate-law ground. See id. at 735-38. It then proceeded to consider the merits of the underlying\nclaim. See id. at 738-43. To the extent that our decision today is not fully consonant with the\ndecision in Balentine, we believe that dissonance stems from Balentine\u2019s misapplication of our\ndecision in Ruiz. The mandate has yet to issue in Balentine, and a petition for rehearing en\nbanc remains pending. We therefore instruct the clerk of the court that the mandate in this\ncase shall not issue until the mandate has issued in Balentine.\n\n                                              23\n\f  Case: 05-70028         Document: 00511229088          Page: 24     Date Filed: 09/09/2010\n\n\n\n       Here, Rocha cannot make the requisite showing under this shared\nstandard. When a claim of actual innocence contests a sentence of death, the\nhabeas petitioner\u2019s claim must tend to negate not just the jury\u2019s discretion to\nimpose a death sentence but the petitioner\u2019s very eligibility for that punishment.\nThat is, a habeas petitioner who is \u201cunquestionably eligible\u201d for the sentence\nreceived can never be \u201cactually innocent of the death penalty.\u201d 65 This is so\nbecause late-arriving constitutional error that impacted only a jury\u2019s sentencing\ndiscretion is not \u201csufficiently fundamental as to excuse the failure to raise it\ntimely in prior state and federal proceedings.\u201d66                  \u201c[T]he \u2018actual innocence\u2019\nrequirement must,\u201d then, \u201cfocus on those elements that render a defendant\neligible for the death penalty, and not on additional mitigating evidence that was\nprevented from being introduced as a result of a claimed constitutional error.\u201d 67\n       But that is just the sort of evidence Rocha presents here. His Wiggins\nclaim reduces to an assertion that mitigating evidence could have influenced the\njury\u2019s discretion in considering a sentence of death; he does not argue that this\nevidence would have rendered him ineligible for the death penalty. A Wiggins\nclaim by its operation in this case goes only to a jury\u2019s discretion in meting out\nthe penalty of death, not a particular defendant\u2019s eligibility for that\npunishment.68\n       That said, a caveat is necessary.

Putting\naside the low probability that any court would resolve sub rosa an issue it had\nvery recently and explicitly left unanswered, we must at any rate conclude that\nthe CCA relied on federal law in making its decision. Hitched to the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s teachings in Sawyer, bare citation to \u00a7 5(a)(3)\u2014without more\u2014\u201cfairly\nappears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law,\u201d 71\nnamely the federal actual innocence standard, and there is no clear and express\nbasis to say otherwise.72 Accordingly, we must \u201caccept as the most reasonable\nexplanation that the state court decided the case the way it did because it\nbelieved that federal law required it to do so.\u201d73 And federal law under Sawyer\nprecludes Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim.\n      Seen generally, the district court\u2019s conclusion\u2014that Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim\nis of no help to him given the procedural posture of his case and the contours of\nstate law\u2014was correct. However, given Balentine and its newly minted reading,\nreasonable jurists could debate whether Rocha\u2019s Wiggins claim fails because\n\u00a7 5(a)(3) operates as an independent and adequate state ground and Rocha\ncannot make the showing of actual innocence of the death penalty that is\nrequired to overcome a state-law procedural bar, or his Wiggins claim fails\nbecause his claim of actual innocence under \u00a7 5(a)(3) fails on the merits.\nTherefore, a COA will issue on this question.

Sanchez-\nLlamas held that suppression of evidence is not an available remedy where, as\nhere, the Vienna Convention \u201cdoes not provide [that] particular remedy, either\nexpressly or implicitly.\u201d79 Absent a prescribed remedy, \u201cit is not for the federal\ncourts to impose one on the States through lawmaking of their own.\u201d 80 And in\nany event, suppression here would upend the state courts\u2019 determination that\nRocha knowingly and voluntarily confessed and did not desire an attorney at\nthat time, whether provided to him by the Mexican consulate or not.\n\n\n                                         ***\n      We AFFIRM the district court, DENY relief on the Brady claim, DENY a\nCOA on the claim under the Vienna Convention, and HOLD that Rocha was not\nentitled to have his Wiggins claim considered on the merits but GRANT a COA\non that question.

Here, the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals\u2019s decision rested upon a finding that Rocha\u2019s allegations \u201cdo not satisfy\nthe requirements of Article 11.071, Section 5(a)(3).\u201d Under our decisions in\nBalentine and Ruiz, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision\u2014relying on\n\u00a7 5(a)(3), which incorporates federal constitutional law\u2014was based on the merits\nof Rocha\u2019s federal constitutional claim rather than an independent state-law\nground. Balentine, 609 F.3d at 738 (\u201c[A] ruling that the facts, if established, did\nnot constitute a violation would also be \u2018interwoven\u2019 with federal constitutional\nlaw.\u201d); Ruiz, 504 F.3d at 527 (\u201cThe boilerplate dismissal by the CCA of an\napplication for abuse of the writ is itself uncertain on this point, being unclear\nwhether the CCA decision was based on the first element [whether the factual\nor legal basis for the subsequent claim was previously unavailable], a state-law\nquestion, or on the second element [whether the facts alleged would establish a\nfederal constitutional violation], a question of federal constitutional law.\u201d). In\nshort, our prior decisions in Balentine and Ruiz suggest that the Texas Court of\nCriminal Appeals\u2019s decision in this case was merits-based rather than\nprocedural, entitling Rocha to federal merits review of his Wiggins claim.\n      The majority opinion does not attempt to reconcile today\u2019s result with our\nprior holding in Balentine, and it does not fully reconcile this case with Ruiz,\nHughes,1 and Rivera.2 Instead, the majority opinion instructs the clerk of the\ncourt to hold the mandate in this case because a petition for rehearing en banc\nhas been filed in Balentine. The majority opinion\u2019s approach is collegial but\ncontrary to the circuit\u2019s rule that one panel cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s\ndecision in the absence of an intervening or superseding decision by the United\nStates Supreme Court or a decision by this court sitting en banc.

Because this court\u2019s prior\ndecisions in Balentine and Ruiz have not been overruled or altered as of this\ndate, we are bound to follow those decisions.\n       Our court\u2019s jurisprudence in this area\u2014including Balentine, Ruiz, Hughes,\nand Rivera\u2014creates confusion as to the precise language that will be considered\nto be \u201can independent and adequate state ground\u201d in cases where the state court\ndoes not elaborate on its reasoning. En banc consideration of Balentine (perhaps\ntogether with this case) may very well be appropriate but, as of this time, the\ncourt has yet to take that action, and Ruiz and Balentine remain controlling\nprecedent. In the meantime, at a minimum, it makes little sense to hold the\nmandate in this case while denying the parties full briefing and possibly further\noral argument on this issue. I would, at the very least, allow full briefing by the\nparties before deciding the merits of the procedural default question and, if\nappropriate, the merits of the Wiggins claim.3\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         The majority opinion states that the issue of whether Rocha is entitled to federal\nmerits review has already been\u201cfully briefed and squarely addressed\u201d by the parties at oral\nargument. But oral argument in this case was heard on June 14, 2010, and the Balentine\ndecision was not released until June 18, 2010. Thus, the parties could not have fully briefed\nand argued the impact of Balentine on the instant case because that decision had not yet been\nreleased. While the parties did submit letters pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 28(j) addressing the impact of Balentine, they did not get the benefit of full briefing\nor the opportunity to address the majority opinion\u2019s novel interpretation of \u00a7 5(a)(3). Indeed,\nno other federal appellate court to date has applied this approach in such a situation.\nAccordingly, I conclude that this case would benefit from full briefing on whether, under\nBalentine, Ruiz, or the approach set forth in the majority opinion, federal merits review of\nRocha\u2019s Wiggins claim is appropriate.\n\n                                               32\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
