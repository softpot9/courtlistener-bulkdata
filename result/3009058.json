Intervenors argue the in-house counsels\u2019 declarations do\n\nnot sufficiently demonstrate their lack of involvement with GE\u2019s\n\n\u201ccompetitive decision making.\u201d GE now moves the Court to\n\noverrule the Intervenors\u2019 objections. Docket No. 142. Upon\n\nconsideration of the motion, the response and reply thereto,\n\nGE\u2019s motion is GRANTED.\n\n      I.   BACKGROUND\n\n      In July 2015, GE identified Sharis A. Pozen, Aimee Imundo,\n\nBradford A. Berenson and Ronald G. Schroeder as the in-house\n\n\n                                  1\n\fcounsel designated to review Intervenors\u2019 Confidential\n\nInformation pursuant to the terms set forth in the Protective\n\nOrder. Between July and the present date, Intervenors sought\n\nvaried modifications to the Protective Order. See e.g. Docket\n\nNos. 57 and 80. The Court directed GE to file amended\n\ndeclarations in support of Mses. Pozen and Imundo and issued two\n\nAmended Protective Orders. See Minute Order, September 7, 2015;\n\nDocket Nos. 110 and 140. The modifications made to the\n\nProtective Order were designed to ensure that sufficient\n\nsafeguards were in place to deter the misuse of Intervenors\u2019\n\nConfidential Information. Still, Intervenors object to the in-\n\nhouse counsel designated by GE.\n\n     II.   ANALYSIS\n\n     In merger cases, Courts may prohibit access to confidential\n\ninformation from those who can be described as \u201ccompetitive\n\ndecision makers.\u201d Intervet, Inc. v. Merial Ltd., 241 F.R.D. 55,\n\n57 (D.D.C. 2007). Competitive decision making includes counsel\u2019s\n\n\u201cactivities, associations, and relationship with a client that\n\nare such as to involve counsel\u2019s advice and participation in any\n\nor all of the client\u2019s decisions (pricing, product design, etc.)\n\nmade in light of similar or corresponding information about a\n\ncompetitor.\u201d U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States, 730 F.2d 1465,\n\n1468 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The primary concern underlying the\n\n\u201ccompetitive decision making test\u201d is that confidential\n\n                                  2\n\finformation will be used or disclosed inadvertently because of\n\nthe lawyer\u2019s role in the client\u2019s business decisions. See Brown\n\nBag Software v. Symantec Corp., 960 F.2d 1465, 1470 (9th Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n     Intervenors\u2019 objections to each of the four counsel\n\nidentified by GE will be discussed in turn.\n\n     A. Sharis A. Pozen and Aimee Imundo\n\n     Ms. Pozen serves as Vice President of Global Competition\n\nand Antitrust at GE. Pozen Decl., Docket No. 108, Ex. A.   Ms.\n\nImundo serves as Executive Counsel, Competition Law and\n\nCompliance at GE. Imundo Decl., Docket No. 108, Ex. C. Mses.\n\nPozen and Imundo explain that they are part of GE\u2019s legal team\n\nthat \u201cfunctions independently\u201d from GE\u2019s appliance team, which\n\nhas its own legal counsel. Mses. Pozen and Imundo affirmatively\n\ndeclare that, in their current roles, they are \u201cnot involved in\n\nany competitive decision making that relates to the GE Appliance\n\ndivision or its business.\u201d Each further declares:\n\n     I do not participate in any decisions or advise the GE\n     Appliance division regarding formulating or implementing\n     strategies to compete with GE Appliances\u2019 competitors or\n     any decision about formulating or implementing pricing\n     strategies, much less \u201cday-to-day pricing.\u201d I am not\n     involved in any competitive decisions regarding pricing,\n     marketing, distribution, product design, or other\n     competitively sensitive issues concerning the GE\n     Appliance business that are the subjects of Confidential\n     Information in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f     Nevertheless, Intervenors argue that \u201cbecause antitrust is,\n\nby its nature about competition, there is a particularly high risk\n\nthat antitrust counsel will be involved in competitive decision-\n\nmaking.\u201d Inter. Response, Docket No. 144 at 4. Intervenors further\n\nargue that because Mses. Pozen and Imundo are high ranking, they\n\nshould   be   forced    to   \u201cmake   a   real   showing     that,    contrary   to\n\nreasonable    expectations,     they     were    not   in    fact    involved   in\n\n[competitive     decision-making]            discussions.\u201d      Id.     Finally,\n\nIntervenors     argue    that    because        Defendants     are    reportedly\n\nconsidering divestitures in order to save the proposed merger,\n\naccess to competitor information by Mses. Pozen and Imundo will\n\n\u201cgive GE an advantage over all other companies.\u201d Id. at 5.\n\n     Intervenors\u2019 arguments fail. First, Intervenors seek more\n\ndetailed declarations from Mses. Pozen and Imundo to ensure they\n\nare not involved in competitive decision making. This is\n\nunnecessary. Ms. Pozen and Ms. Imundo have made their\n\ndeclarations under oath. Each have explicitly declared that they\n\nare not, and will not for the next two years, be involved in the\n\ntype of competitive decision making prohibited by case law and\n\nthe Second Amended Protective Order. Pozen Decl.; Imundo Decl.\n\nAbsent evidence contradicting the sworn declarations made by\n\nMses. Pozen and Imundo, there is no basis to conclude that they\n\nare involved in competitive decision making. F.T.C. v. Whole\n\nFoods Market, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-1021, 2009 WL 2059741,\n\n                                         4\n\f*3 (D.D.C. July 6, 2007) (holding that based on the in-house\n\ncounsel\u2019s declaration, the Court was unable to conclude that the\n\ncounsel was involved in competitive decision making, despite\n\nintervenors\u2019 arguments to the contrary); compare with F.T.C. v.\n\nSysco Corporation, Case No. 15-256, 2015 WL 1120013, *2 (D.D.C.\n\nMarch 12, 2015) (holding that in-house counsel was \u201ctoo close\u201d\n\nto Defendant\u2019s competitive decision making where the in-house\n\ncounsel \u201ccandidly acknowledged that issues such as pricing,\n\npurchasing, and marketing may be discussed at the Executive\n\nTeam\u2019s weekly meetings.\u201d).\n\n     Moreover, the First Amended Protective Order sought to\n\nfurther protect the Intervenors\u2019 Confidential Information by\n\nincluding the following penalty provision:\n\n     Any violation of this order may be deemed contempt and\n     punished by a fine of up to $250,000. Any imposed fine\n     will be paid individually by the person who violates\n     this Order. A violator may not seek to be reimbursed or\n     indemnified for the payment the violator has made. If\n     the violator is an attorney, the court may recommend to\n     the appropriate professional disciplinary authority that\n     the attorney be sanctioned, suspended or disbarred.\n\nDocket No. 110 \u00b6 18. Similarly, the Second Amended\n\nProtective Order addressed the Intervenors\u2019 concern about\n\npotential misuse of information by in-house counsel as it\n\npertains to Defendants\u2019 divestiture negotiations by\n\nexplicitly stating \u201c[i]n-house counsel shall have access to\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fsuch Confidential Information for the purpose of defending\n\nthis litigation only.\u201d Docket No. 140 at \u00b6 10(g).\n\n     In light of Mses. Pozen and Imundo\u2019s affirmative\n\ndeclarations, the lack of contradictory evidence presented\n\nby Intervenors, and additional protections built into the\n\nSecond Amended Protective Order, Intervenors\u2019 objections to\n\nMses. Pozen and Imundo are overruled.\n\n     B. Bradford A. Berenson and Ronald G. Schroeder\n\n     Mr. Berenson serves as Vice President and Senior Counsel,\n\nLitigation and Legal Policy at GE. Berenson Decl., Docket No.\n\n108, Ex. B. Mr. Schroeder serves as Global Executive Litigation\n\nCounsel-Corporate at GE. Schroeder Decl., Docket No. 108, Ex. D.\n\nBoth declare that they are responsible for management and\n\noversight of this litigation and that they are granted access to\n\nconfidential information in \u201cvirtually all litigation and\n\ninvestigation matters\u201d they handle for GE. Berenson Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6\n\n7-8; Schroeder Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n     Intervenors argue that Mr. Berenson should explain in more\n\ndetail what his responsibilities are pertaining to \u201ccompliance\u201d\n\nand \u201clegal policy for GE worldwide.\u201d Inter. Response at 9.\n\nSimilarly, Intervenors argue Mr. Schroeder should explain the\n\nmeaning of \u201cmanagement of compliance risk\u201d and \u201cimplementation\n\nof company-wide legal policy.\u201d The concerns raised by\n\nIntervenors about Messrs. Berenson and Schroeder deserve even\n\n                                  6\n\fless discussion than those raised about Mses. Pozen and Imundo.\n\nWhen considered in their entirety, Messrs. Berenson and\n\nSchroeder\u2019s declarations leave no doubt that their duties are\n\nfar from the competitive decision making prohibited by the\n\nSecond Amended Protective Order and controlling case law. Mr.\n\nBerenson is responsible for litigation, government and internal\n\ninvestigations, compliance and legal policy for GE Worldwide.\n\nBerenson Decl. \u00b6 5. Mr. Schroeder manages U.S. and international\n\nlitigation, internal investigations and compliance risk.\n\nSchroeder Decl. \u00b6 4. Nothing in Messrs. Berenson and Schroeder\u2019s\n\ndeclarations indicates they are involved with GE\u2019s competitive\n\ndecision making and Intervenors have offered no evidence to the\n\ncontrary.\n\n     III.

Competitive decision making includes counsel\u2019s\n\n\u201cactivities, associations, and relationship with a client that\n\nare such as to involve counsel\u2019s advice and participation in any\n\nor all of the client\u2019s decisions (pricing, product design, etc.)\n\nmade in light of similar or corresponding information about a\n\ncompetitor.\u201d U.S. Steel Corp. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433501\"><a href=\"/opinion/433501/us-steel-corporation-v-the-united-states-and-us-international-trade/\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1468 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The primary concern underlying the\n\n\u201ccompetitive decision making test\u201d is that confidential\n\n                                  2\n\finformation will be used or disclosed inadvertently because of\n\nthe lawyer\u2019s role in the client\u2019s business decisions.

Sharis A. Pozen and Aimee Imundo\n\n     Ms. Pozen serves as Vice President of Global Competition\n\nand Antitrust at GE. Pozen Decl., Docket No. 108, Ex. A.   Ms.\n\nImundo serves as Executive Counsel, Competition Law and\n\nCompliance at GE. Imundo Decl., Docket No. 108, Ex. C. Mses.\n\nPozen and Imundo explain that they are part of GE\u2019s legal team\n\nthat \u201cfunctions independently\u201d from GE\u2019s appliance team, which\n\nhas its own legal counsel. Mses. Pozen and Imundo affirmatively\n\ndeclare that, in their current roles, they are \u201cnot involved in\n\nany competitive decision making that relates to the GE Appliance\n\ndivision or its business.\u201d Each further declares:\n\n     I do not participate in any decisions or advise the GE\n     Appliance division regarding formulating or implementing\n     strategies to compete with GE Appliances\u2019 competitors or\n     any decision about formulating or implementing pricing\n     strategies, much less \u201cday-to-day pricing.\u201d I am not\n     involved in any competitive decisions regarding pricing,\n     marketing, distribution, product design, or other\n     competitively sensitive issues concerning the GE\n     Appliance business that are the subjects of Confidential\n     Information in this case.\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\f     Nevertheless, Intervenors argue that \u201cbecause antitrust is,\n\nby its nature about competition, there is a particularly high risk\n\nthat antitrust counsel will be involved in competitive decision-\n\nmaking.\u201d Inter. Response, Docket No. 144 at 4. Intervenors further\n\nargue that because Mses. Pozen and Imundo are high ranking, they\n\nshould   be   forced    to   \u201cmake   a   real   showing     that,    contrary   to\n\nreasonable    expectations,     they     were    not   in    fact    involved   in\n\n[competitive     decision-making]            discussions.\u201d      Id.     Finally,\n\nIntervenors     argue    that    because        Defendants     are    reportedly\n\nconsidering divestitures in order to save the proposed merger,\n\naccess to competitor information by Mses. Pozen and Imundo will\n\n\u201cgive GE an advantage over all other companies.\u201d Id. at 5.\n\n     Intervenors\u2019 arguments fail. First, Intervenors seek more\n\ndetailed declarations from Mses. Pozen and Imundo to ensure they\n\nare not involved in competitive decision making. This is\n\nunnecessary. Ms. Pozen and Ms. Imundo have made their\n\ndeclarations under oath. Each have explicitly declared that they\n\nare not, and will not for the next two years, be involved in the\n\ntype of competitive decision making prohibited by case law and\n\nthe Second Amended Protective Order. Pozen Decl.; Imundo Decl.\n\nAbsent evidence contradicting the sworn declarations made by\n\nMses. Pozen and Imundo, there is no basis to conclude that they\n\nare involved in competitive decision making. F.T.C. v. Whole\n\nFoods Market, Inc., et al., Case No. 07-1021, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2059741</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n                                         4\n\f*3 (D.D.C. July 6, 2007) (holding that based on the in-house\n\ncounsel\u2019s declaration, the Court was unable to conclude that the\n\ncounsel was involved in competitive decision making, despite\n\nintervenors\u2019 arguments to the contrary); compare with F.T.C. v.\n\nSysco Corporation, Case No. 15-256, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1120013</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2 (D.D.C.\n\nMarch 12, 2015) (holding that in-house counsel was \u201ctoo close\u201d\n\nto Defendant\u2019s competitive decision making where the in-house\n\ncounsel \u201ccandidly acknowledged that issues such as pricing,\n\npurchasing, and marketing may be discussed at the Executive\n\nTeam\u2019s weekly meetings.\u201d).\n\n     Moreover, the First Amended Protective Order sought to\n\nfurther protect the Intervenors\u2019 Confidential Information by\n\nincluding the following penalty provision:\n\n     Any violation of this order may be deemed contempt and\n     punished by a fine of up to $250,000. Any imposed fine\n     will be paid individually by the person who violates\n     this Order. A violator may not seek to be reimbursed or\n     indemnified for the payment the violator has made. If\n     the violator is an attorney, the court may recommend to\n     the appropriate professional disciplinary authority that\n     the attorney be sanctioned, suspended or disbarred.\n\nDocket No. 110 \u00b6 18. Similarly, the Second Amended\n\nProtective Order addressed the Intervenors\u2019 concern about\n\npotential misuse of information by in-house counsel as it\n\npertains to Defendants\u2019 divestiture negotiations by\n\nexplicitly stating \u201c[i]n-house counsel shall have access to\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fsuch Confidential Information for the purpose of defending\n\nthis litigation only.\u201d Docket No. 140 at \u00b6 10(g).\n\n     In light of Mses. Pozen and Imundo\u2019s affirmative\n\ndeclarations, the lack of contradictory evidence presented\n\nby Intervenors, and additional protections built into the\n\nSecond Amended Protective Order, Intervenors\u2019 objections to\n\nMses. Pozen and Imundo are overruled.\n\n     B. Bradford A. Berenson and Ronald G. Schroeder\n\n     Mr. Berenson serves as Vice President and Senior Counsel,\n\nLitigation and Legal Policy at GE. Berenson Decl., Docket No.\n\n108, Ex. B. Mr. Schroeder serves as Global Executive Litigation\n\nCounsel-Corporate at GE. Schroeder Decl., Docket No. 108, Ex. D.\n\nBoth declare that they are responsible for management and\n\noversight of this litigation and that they are granted access to\n\nconfidential information in \u201cvirtually all litigation and\n\ninvestigation matters\u201d they handle for GE. Berenson Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6\n\n7-8; Schroeder Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n     Intervenors argue that Mr. Berenson should explain in more\n\ndetail what his responsibilities are pertaining to \u201ccompliance\u201d\n\nand \u201clegal policy for GE worldwide.\u201d Inter. Response at 9.\n\nSimilarly, Intervenors argue Mr. Schroeder should explain the\n\nmeaning of \u201cmanagement of compliance risk\u201d and \u201cimplementation\n\nof company-wide legal policy.\u201d The concerns raised by\n\nIntervenors about Messrs. Berenson and Schroeder deserve even\n\n                                  6\n\fless discussion than those raised about Mses. Pozen and Imundo.\n\nWhen considered in their entirety, Messrs. Berenson and\n\nSchroeder\u2019s declarations leave no doubt that their duties are\n\nfar from the competitive decision making prohibited by the\n\nSecond Amended Protective Order and controlling case law. Mr.\n\nBerenson is responsible for litigation, government and internal\n\ninvestigations, compliance and legal policy for GE Worldwide.\n\nBerenson Decl. \u00b6 5. Mr. Schroeder manages U.S. and international\n\nlitigation, internal investigations and compliance risk.\n\nSchroeder Decl. \u00b6 4. Nothing in Messrs. Berenson and Schroeder\u2019s\n\ndeclarations indicates they are involved with GE\u2019s competitive\n\ndecision making and Intervenors have offered no evidence to the\n\ncontrary.\n\n     III. CONCLUSION\n\n     For the reasons discussed above, GE\u2019s motion is GRANTED. An\n\nappropriate order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n     SO ORDERED.\n\n\nSigned:     Emmet G.
