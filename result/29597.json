This court granted a\n\ncertificate of appealability (COA) on the following issues:\n\n(1) whether Diaz\u2019s postjudgment motion raising his Apprendi v.\n\nNew Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), claim should have been construed\n\nas a postjudgment motion to amend under FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a) and\n\nwhether Diaz reasonably could have raised the claim prior to the\n\n     *\n        Pursuant to 5TH CIR.

See United States v. Brown, 305 F.3d\n\n304, 310 (5th Cir. 2002).
