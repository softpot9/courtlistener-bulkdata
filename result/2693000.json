Main\nStreet, Dayton, Ohio 45402\n        Attorney for Plaintiff-Appellee\n\n                                         ..........\n\nDONOVAN, J.\n\n         {\u00b6 1}   This matter is before the Court on the Notice of Appeal of Margaret\n\nWalsh-Cotton, filed March 6, 2013. Walsh-Cotton appeals from the February 4, 2013\n\ndecision of the trial court that affirmed the City of Dayton Board of Zoning Appeals\n\n(\u201cBZA\u201d) July 23, 2013 decision; the BZA affirmed the decision of the Zoning Administrator\n\nthat denied Walsh-Cotton\u2019s application to establish a home massage studio in an accessory\n\nstructure at 116 Brown Street, where she resides. We hereby affirm the decision of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n         {\u00b6 2}   Walsh-Cotton, a licensed massage therapist, purchased the Brown Street\n\nproperty on April 27, 2012, having previously operated a massage studio at her former\n\nresidence for 13 years. The City Zoning Code provides that accessory buildings are not\n\npermitted to be used for home occupations, and it sets forth a minimum side setback of three\n\nfeet. Walsh-Cotton sought to establish her massage studio by enlarging an existing 120\n\nsquare foot accessory building on the property by adding 88.5 square feet, which would\n\nresult in the proposed building being located less than three feet from the side property line.\n\nHer application was denied on June 11, 2012, and Walsh-Cotton appealed the Zoning\n\nAdministrator\u2019s decision on June 18, 2012, to the BZA.\n\n         {\u00b6 3}   A hearing was held on July 10, 2012 before the BZA. On July 23, 2012, the\n\nBZA issued a written decision granting the area variance but denying the use variance.\n\nWalsh-Cotton appealed the decision of the BZA to the court of common pleas. Regarding\n\f                                                                                                3\n\nthe use variance, Walsh-Cotton asserted that the hearing transcript demonstrates that a\n\nmotion was made to disapprove the use variance, and that the board members voted three to\n\none to deny the motion. She asserted that the BZA made an illegal decision by denying her\n\nthe use variance after voting against its disapproval. The trial court determined as follows:\n\n               At the hearing, Peter Bracher, member, upon motion, moved to\n\n       determine that \u201cthere was not a preponderance of reliable, probative and\n\n       substantial evidence to make the specified findings required under R.C.G.O.\n\n       \u00a7 150.120.10(D)(2), and deny the application for the [use variance].\u201d\n\n       (emphasis added). The motion was seconded by Diane Graham, member. A\n\n       poll was then taken of the board and resulted in the following: Larry Ison,\n\n       secretary, voted \u201cno\u201d, Ms. Graham voted \u201cyes\u201d, Mr. Bracher voted \u201cno\u201d and\n\n       Anthony Ciani, member, voted \u201cno\u201d. Mr. Ciani then concluded that the use\n\n       variance was denied by a 3-1 vote.\n\n               Although the board \u201ctechnically\u201d voted 3-1 against the proffered\n\n       motion and in so doing literally inferred, via their vote, that there was a\n\n       preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to make a\n\n       finding required under R.C.G.O. \u00a7 150.120.10(D)(2), this was clearly\n\n       contrary to the board members\u2019 intent. As stated by Mr. Ciani\u2019s conclusion,\n\n       it was agreed upon by the board members that the use variance was denied.\n\n               Moreover, the BZA followed all the necessary procedures set forth in\n\n       R.C.G.O. \u00a7 150.120.7. The BZA issued a written decision on July 23, 2012\n\n       within 30 days of the hearing held on July 10, 2012. The BZA denied Ms.\n\f                                                                                           4\n\n       Cotton\u2019s application for a use variance. Lastly, the BZA had a concurring\n\n       vote of the majority of the members to deny the use variance.\n\n       {\u00b6 4}    Walsh-Cotton further asserted that the hearing for her application for a use\n\nvariance was not properly advertised, such that the decision of the BZA is illegal. The trial\n\ncourt determined as follows:\n\n               Ms. Cotton\u2019s primary contention is that the notice failed to indicate\n\n       the subject matter of the hearing in that the notice indicated a hearing on the\n\n       set-back variance request, but failed to mention a hearing on the request for a\n\n       use variance. However, the notice provided in relevant part: \u201ca variance\n\n       application to use accessory buildings for home occupation and reduction\n\n       in required side setback at 116 Brown Street . . . Proposed Use: Home\n\n       Occupation (Massage therapist). Establish a massage studio in an existing\n\n       120 square foot accessory building. Proposed to add 88.5 square feet to the\n\n       existing accessory building . . .\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n               Thus, the notice provided all the requirements as set forth in R.C.G.O.\n\n       \u00a7150.120.4 including but not limited to the time, place, date and subject\n\n       matter of the hearing including both the set-back variance and the request for\n\n       use variance.\n\n       {\u00b6 5}    Walsh-Cotton further asserted to the trial court that the BZA\u2019s decision is\n\nillegal because the board used the wrong standard of proof, namely the clear and convincing\n\nevidence standard, in determining whether to grant her use variance.         The trial court\n\ndetermined as follows:\n\f                                                                                          5\n\n               Ms. Cotton\u2019s suggestion that the only standard of proof required of\n\n       her pursuant to Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2506.08 is that of the preponderance of\n\n       substantial, reliable and probative evidence on the whole record is misplaced.\n\n        R.C. \u00a7 2506.08 sets forth the standard for a court of common pleas to\n\n       determine if an order, adjudication or decision from an administrative officer\n\n       or agency on appeal is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious,\n\n       unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial,\n\n       reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. (emphasis added.)\n\n               R.C.G.O. \u00a7 150.120.10 sets forth the standard of proof an applicant\n\n       must satisfy in order for the BZA to grant a use variance. It is by a clear and\n\n       convincing evidence standard.     Thus, the BZA did not apply the wrong\n\n       standard in holding Ms. Cotton to the burden of supporting her request by\n\n       clear and convincing evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 6}    Finally, Walsh-Cotton asserted to the trial court that the BZA\u2019s decision\n\ndenying the use variance was not supported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable and\n\nprobative evidence on the whole record. The trial court noted that the BZA determined that\n\nWalsh-Cotton satisfied the requirements for a use variance set forth in R.C.G.O. \u00a7\n\n150.120.10(D)(2)(a)(ii)-(v).   It further noted that the board debated whether or not\n\nWalsh-Cotton satisfied the requirement in R.C.G.O \u00a7 150.120.10(D)(2)(a)(i), namely\n\nwhether or not her variance request stemmed from a condition that is unique to her property\n\nand not ordinarily found in the same zone or district. The court concluded that \u201cthe BZA\u2019s\n\ndecision to deny Ms. Cotton\u2019s request for a use variance was supported by a preponderance\n\f                                                                                          6\n\nof reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 7}    Walsh-Cotton asserts three assignments of error herein.         For ease of\n\nanalysis, we will consider her second assigned error first. It is as follows:\n\n       THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS ERRED BY NOT FINDING THAT THE\n\n\u201cDECISION, FINAL ORDER AND ENTRY\u201d OF JULY 23, 2012 WAS ILLEGAL\n\nBECAUSE A HEARING ON SAID REQUEST FOR A USE VARIANCE WAS NOT\n\nPROPERLY ADVERTISED AS REQUIRED BY CITY OF DAYTON ORDINANCES.\n\n       {\u00b6 8}     According to Walsh-Cotton, the \u201cnotice of hearing only indicated that there\n\nwould be a hearing on the request for a set-back variance, not the use variance. Thus,\n\nAppellant could not adequately prepare for the hearing.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 9}     As this Court has previously noted:\n\n                Administrative appeals to the court of common pleas are governed by\n\n       R.C. Chapter 2506. In an appeal of an administrative order or decision under\n\n       this chapter, the trial court is authorized to reverse, vacate, or modify the\n\n       administrative order if the court finds the decision is \u201cunconstitutional,\n\n       illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the\n\n       preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.\u201d         R.C.\n\n       2506.04; Parisi v. City of Dayton, Montgomery App. No. 20045,\n\n       2004-Ohio-2739, \u00b6 11. Because the trial court must determine whether the\n\n       decision is supported \u201cby the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and\n\n       probative evidence,\u201d R.C. 2506.04 grants the trial court \u201cextensive power\u201d to\n\n       weigh the evidence.

Youngstown Bd. of Zoning Appeals, 90 Ohio\n\f                                                                                              7\n\n       St.3d 142, 147, 735 N.E.2d 433, 2000-Ohio-493; Smith v.

Under R.C. 2506.04, the court of\n\n       appeals does not have the same extensive power to weigh the evidence as is\n\n       granted to the common pleas court. Id. The appellate court's inquiry is limited\n\n       to questions of law, including whether the trial court abused its discretion. Id.\n\n       at 147-48, 465 N.E.2d 848.        \u201cAppellate courts must not substitute their\n\n       judgment for those of an administrative agency or a trial court absent the\n\n       approved criteria for doing so.\u201d Henley, 90 Ohio St.3d at 147, 735 N.E.2d\n\n       433, quoting Lorain City School Dist.

The notice, as the language the trial court emphasized reflects, includes both the\n\nuse variance and the \u201cside setback,\u201c and it further indicates the \u201cProposed use,\u201d namely to\n\n\u201cestablish a massage studio in an existing 120 square-foot accessory building.\u201d (Emphasis\n\nadded).     There being no abuse of discretion, Walsh-Cotton\u2019s second assigned error is\n\noverruled.\n\n          {\u00b6 12} We will next consider Walsh-Cotton\u2019s first and third assigned errors\n\ntogether. They are as follows:\n\n                 THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS ERRED BY NOT FINDING\n\n          THAT THE \u201cDECISION, FINAL ORDER AND ENTRY\u201d OF JULY 23,\n\n          2012, OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS, WHICH DID NOT\n\n          GRANT THE USE VARIANCE FOR THE PROPOSED USE OF A HOME\n\n          OCCUPATION IN AN ACCESSORY BUILDING, WAS ILLEGAL\n\n          AND/OR ARBITRARY BECAUSE THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS\n\n          VOTED 3-1 AGAINST A MOTION RECOMMENDING THAT THE\n\n          REQUEST FOR A USE VARIANCE BE DENIED AND, DESPITE THIS,\n\n          THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS IN NOT GRANTING THE USE\n\n          VARIANCE DID DENY THE USE VARIANCE.\n\n          And,\n\n                 THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS ERRED BY NOT FINDING\n\n          THAT THE \u201cDECISION, FINAL ORDER AND ENTRY\u201d OF JULY 23,\n\n          2012, OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS IN DENYING THE USE\n\f                                                                                             9\n\n         VARIANCE WAS UNSUPPORTED BY THE PREPONDERANCE OF\n\n         SUBSTANTIAL, RELIABLE AND PROBATIVE EVIDENCE ON THE\n\n         WHOLE RECORD.\n\n         {\u00b6 13}    According to Walsh-Cotton, \u201cregardless of their intent, the BZA still was in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2506.08 and by issuing a decision that was contrary to the vote is illegal\n\nand contrary to law (sic). The board members clearly voted on a motion to disapprove the\n\nvariance, and any written decision contrary to that vote is contrary to law and serves an\n\ninjustice upon Appellant.\u201d She asserts that the \u201cdecision in this case in finding that the\n\nAppellant failed to prove that her property was unique and not ordinarily found in the same\n\nzone or district was contrary to the evidence in the record.\u201d Walsh-Cotton asserts that the\n\ntranscript of the hearing reflects that the board members determined that her \u201cproperty has\n\nthe unique qualities necessary to allow for the use and set back variances requested in this\n\ncase.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 14} As the Supreme Court of Ohio previously noted: \u201cA variance is intended to\n\npermit amelioration of strict compliance of the zoning ordinance in individual cases. It is\n\ndesigned to afford protection and relief against unjust invasions of private property rights\n\nand to provide a flexible procedure for the protection of constitutional rights. * * * .\u201d\n\nConsolidated Management, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, 6 Ohio St.3d 238, 240, 452 N.E.2d\n\n1287 (1983).       Walsh-Cotton\u2019s request for a use variance was subject to consideration\n\npursuant to R.C.G.O. \u00a7 150.120.10(D)(2), which provides in relevant part:\n\n                  In order to grant a use variance, the BZA shall determine that strict\n\n         compliance with the terms of this Code will result in an unnecessary hardship\n\f                                                                                            10\n\n       to the applicant. The applicant must demonstrate such a hardship by clear\n\n       and convincing evidence that all of the criteria in Sub-section (a) are satisfied.\n\n       ***\n\n               (a) The applicant shall demonstrate hardship with the following:\n\n               (i) The variance requested stems from a condition that is unique to the\n\n       property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district.\n\nWe note that the Supreme Court of Ohio has determined that the \u201cmere fact that one\u2019s\n\nproperty can be put to a more profitable use does not, in itself, establish an unnecessary\n\nhardship where less profitable alternatives are available within the zoning classification.\u201d\n\nConsolidated Management, Inc. v. City of Cleveland, 6 Ohio St.3d 238, 452 N.E.2d 1287\n\n(1983), at syllabus. Further, applicants cannot obtain a variance based upon undue hardship\n\nwhere the applicant purchased the property with knowledge of the zoning restrictions. See,\n\nid.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} The following exchange occurred at the hearing:\n\n               MR. CIANI: Mr. Smothers, could we see the standards again for a use\n\n       variance? I think it would be helpful for us to review them. And there are\n\n       five total standards for a use variance; is that correct?\n\n               MR. ISON: It\u2019s now one through five, yes.\n\n               MR. BRACHER: * * * And they all have to be satisfied?\n\n               MR. ISON: Yes, exactly.\n\n               MR. CROFT: By a clear and convincing evidence.\n\n               ***\n\f                                                                                  11\n\n       MR. CIANI: * * * I have the duty and responsibility to discuss use\n\nvariances do put a strong burden on the applicant, and so for that reason I ask\n\nthat we take a look at these individually and as we deliberate, feel free to\n\ncomment on any one of the standards whether you think that there has been\n\nevidence produced that would substantiate or fulfill the requirement of the\n\nstandard, or whether the evidence is contrary to the expectations here.\n\n       Why don\u2019t we go through them one at a time? The variance stems\n\nfrom a condition that is unique to the property at issue and not ordinarily\n\nfound in the same zoned district.\n\n       MR. EVANS: This kind of easement, two accessory structures on that\n\nproperty, you can easily make a case that that\u2019s a unique, if you\u2019re talking\n\nabout at Deweese, where there is you know, five-thousand square foot, but\n\nwe\u2019re talking about a very tight property and that would certainly be unique\n\nthat there are two accessory structures on there.\n\nMR. CIANI: How do others feel about uniqueness?\n\n       MR.BRACHER: But does that particular uniqueness create a hardship\n\nfor the owner? * * *\n\n        ***\n\n       MR. CIANI: So you have some doubt about this - -\n\n       MR. BRACHER: Yeah, I have some difficulty with number one.\n\n       ***\n\n       MR. BRACHER: Yeah, I\u2019m a little, I\u2019m still a little uncomfortable\n\f                                                                                         12\n\nwith number one. I don\u2019t know about anybody else.\n\n       MR. EVANS: I think we\u2019ve mentioned before that having an accessory\n\nbuilding and a garage makes the property unique. But unique to the degree that\n\nthe property owner deserves relief, that\u2019s the question. (Inaudible). So I think\n\nthis one is the potential show stopper, either we can buy into the satisfaction of the\n\nstandard or not.\n\n       MR. CIANI: It seems we\u2019re having trouble getting over this one. * * *\n\n       ***\n\n       MR. BRACHER: There can be other properties that have a garden shed of\n\nsome kind, as well as the garage. It seems to me - -\n\n       MR. CIANI: Unique does mean one of a kind.\n\n       MR. BRACHER:          Yes, it does.\n\n       MR. CIANI: Not unusual, but a one and only. At least - -\n\n       MR. BRACHER: Yeah.\n\n       MR. CIANI: By dictionary, strictly - -\n\n***\n\n       MR. BRACHER: * * * I move to determine that there is not a\n\npreponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to make the\n\nspecified findings required under RCGO 150.120.10, D2, and deny the application\n\nas for area variances.\n\n       MR. ISON: For use variance.\n\n       MR. BRACHER: For use variance, thank you.\n\f                                                                                        13\n\n         MR. CIANI: Do you wish to cite Paragraph 1?\n\n         MR. BRACHER: And I would cite Paragraph 1, yes.\n\n         MR. CIANI: Is there a second to that motion?\n\n         MS. GRAHAM: I\u2019ll second it.\n\n         MR. CIANI: Second by Ms. Graham. Will you poll the Board, please?\n\n         MR. ISON: Mr. Evans.\n\n         MR. EVANS: No.\n\n         MR. ISON: Ms. Graham.\n\n         MS. GRAHAM: Yes.\n\n         MR. ISON: Mr. Bracher.\n\n         MR. BRACHER: No.\n\n         MR. ISON: And Mr. Ciani.\n\n         MR. CIANI: No.\n\n         MR. ISON: So the use variance is denied by the 3-2 vote.\n\n         MR. CIANI: There are only four of us here. 3-1.\n\n         MR. ISON: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, 3-1. I\u2019m sorry. That is all we have.\n\n{\u00b6 16}     The written decision of the BZA provides in part:\n\n         After additional deliberation, the Board did not find that strict compliance\n\nwith Zoning Code, would result in unnecessary hardship to the Applicant. Much\n\nof the Board\u2019s discussion focused on an inability to find that the Applicant had\n\ndemonstrated that the variance, that is, the allowance of a home occupation in an\n\naccessory building which is prohibited pursuant to City of Dayton Revised Code\n\f                                                                                         14\n\n       of General Ordinances \u00a7 150.440(B)(6), stems from a condition that is unique to\n\n       the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district\n\n       (R.C.G.O. 150.120.10(D)(2)(a)(i).\n\n       {\u00b6 17}    We initially note that the trial court indicated that Mr. Ison voted \u201cno\u201d on the\n\nuse variance, which is inaccurate. Mr. Ison is the board secretary and not a voting member of\n\nthe board. This mischaracterization of the record, however, does not affect the outcome herein.\n\nWhile Walsh-Cotton contends that the BZA determined that her property is unique, based upon\n\nthe initial comments of Mr. Evans above, we note that Mr. Evans voted with the majority\n\nregarding the use variance, and that the above exchange suggests that the majority found\n\nWalsh-Cotton\u2019s property to be unusual but not unique. We agree with the trial court that while\n\nthe BZA \u201ctechnically\u201d voted against disapproving the use variance, Mr. Ison clearly expressed\n\nthe board members\u2019 intention at the hearing to deny the use variance at the conclusion of the 3-1\n\nvote. Further, the BZA expressly declined to find that strict compliance with the zoning code\n\nwill result in an unnecessary hardship to Walsh-Cotton, as required by R.C.G.O.\n\n150.120.10(D)(2), before a use variance can be granted. In other words, there is no discrepancy\n\nbetween the BZA\u2019s intent and its written decision. We conclude that the trial court correctly\n\naffirmed the BZA\u2019s decision that Walsh-Cotton failed to meet the requirement of R.C.G.O. \u00a7\n\n150.120.10(D)(2)(a)(i) with clear and convincing evidence.       Walsh-Cotton\u2019s first and third\n\nassigned errors are overruled.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Having overruled all of Walsh-Cotton\u2019s assigned errors, the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n                                           ..........\n\f[Cite as Oregon Place Assn. v.

Walsh-Cotton appeals from the February 4, 2013\n\ndecision of the trial court that affirmed the City of Dayton Board of Zoning Appeals\n\n(\u201cBZA\u201d) July 23, 2013 decision; the BZA affirmed the decision of the Zoning Administrator\n\nthat denied Walsh-Cotton\u2019s application to establish a home massage studio in an accessory\n\nstructure at 116 Brown Street, where she resides. We hereby affirm the decision of the trial\n\ncourt.\n\n         {\u00b6 2}   Walsh-Cotton, a licensed massage therapist, purchased the Brown Street\n\nproperty on April 27, 2012, having previously operated a massage studio at her former\n\nresidence for 13 years. The City Zoning Code provides that accessory buildings are not\n\npermitted to be used for home occupations, and it sets forth a minimum side setback of three\n\nfeet. Walsh-Cotton sought to establish her massage studio by enlarging an existing 120\n\nsquare foot accessory building on the property by adding 88.5 square feet, which would\n\nresult in the proposed building being located less than three feet from the side property line.\n\nHer application was denied on June 11, 2012, and Walsh-Cotton appealed the Zoning\n\nAdministrator\u2019s decision on June 18, 2012, to the BZA.\n\n         {\u00b6 3}   A hearing was held on July 10, 2012 before the BZA. On July 23, 2012, the\n\nBZA issued a written decision granting the area variance but denying the use variance.\n\nWalsh-Cotton appealed the decision of the BZA to the court of common pleas. Regarding\n\f                                                                                                3\n\nthe use variance, Walsh-Cotton asserted that the hearing transcript demonstrates that a\n\nmotion was made to disapprove the use variance, and that the board members voted three to\n\none to deny the motion. She asserted that the BZA made an illegal decision by denying her\n\nthe use variance after voting against its disapproval. The trial court determined as follows:\n\n               At the hearing, Peter Bracher, member, upon motion, moved to\n\n       determine that \u201cthere was not a preponderance of reliable, probative and\n\n       substantial evidence to make the specified findings required under R.C.G.O.\n\n       \u00a7 150.120.10(D)(2), and deny the application for the [use variance].\u201d\n\n       (emphasis added). The motion was seconded by Diane Graham, member. A\n\n       poll was then taken of the board and resulted in the following: Larry Ison,\n\n       secretary, voted \u201cno\u201d, Ms. Graham voted \u201cyes\u201d, Mr. Bracher voted \u201cno\u201d and\n\n       Anthony Ciani, member, voted \u201cno\u201d. Mr. Ciani then concluded that the use\n\n       variance was denied by a 3-1 vote.\n\n               Although the board \u201ctechnically\u201d voted 3-1 against the proffered\n\n       motion and in so doing literally inferred, via their vote, that there was a\n\n       preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to make a\n\n       finding required under R.C.G.O. \u00a7 150.120.10(D)(2), this was clearly\n\n       contrary to the board members\u2019 intent. As stated by Mr. Ciani\u2019s conclusion,\n\n       it was agreed upon by the board members that the use variance was denied.\n\n               Moreover, the BZA followed all the necessary procedures set forth in\n\n       R.C.G.O. \u00a7 150.120.7. The BZA issued a written decision on July 23, 2012\n\n       within 30 days of the hearing held on July 10, 2012. The BZA denied Ms.\n\f                                                                                           4\n\n       Cotton\u2019s application for a use variance. Lastly, the BZA had a concurring\n\n       vote of the majority of the members to deny the use variance.\n\n       {\u00b6 4}    Walsh-Cotton further asserted that the hearing for her application for a use\n\nvariance was not properly advertised, such that the decision of the BZA is illegal. The trial\n\ncourt determined as follows:\n\n               Ms. Cotton\u2019s primary contention is that the notice failed to indicate\n\n       the subject matter of the hearing in that the notice indicated a hearing on the\n\n       set-back variance request, but failed to mention a hearing on the request for a\n\n       use variance. However, the notice provided in relevant part: \u201ca variance\n\n       application to use accessory buildings for home occupation and reduction\n\n       in required side setback at 116 Brown Street . . . Proposed Use: Home\n\n       Occupation (Massage therapist). Establish a massage studio in an existing\n\n       120 square foot accessory building. Proposed to add 88.5 square feet to the\n\n       existing accessory building . . .\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n               Thus, the notice provided all the requirements as set forth in R.C.G.O.\n\n       \u00a7150.120.4 including but not limited to the time, place, date and subject\n\n       matter of the hearing including both the set-back variance and the request for\n\n       use variance.\n\n       {\u00b6 5}    Walsh-Cotton further asserted to the trial court that the BZA\u2019s decision is\n\nillegal because the board used the wrong standard of proof, namely the clear and convincing\n\nevidence standard, in determining whether to grant her use variance.         The trial court\n\ndetermined as follows:\n\f                                                                                          5\n\n               Ms. Cotton\u2019s suggestion that the only standard of proof required of\n\n       her pursuant to Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2506.08 is that of the preponderance of\n\n       substantial, reliable and probative evidence on the whole record is misplaced.\n\n        R.C. \u00a7 2506.08 sets forth the standard for a court of common pleas to\n\n       determine if an order, adjudication or decision from an administrative officer\n\n       or agency on appeal is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious,\n\n       unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial,\n\n       reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. (emphasis added.)\n\n               R.C.G.O. \u00a7 150.120.10 sets forth the standard of proof an applicant\n\n       must satisfy in order for the BZA to grant a use variance. It is by a clear and\n\n       convincing evidence standard.     Thus, the BZA did not apply the wrong\n\n       standard in holding Ms. Cotton to the burden of supporting her request by\n\n       clear and convincing evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 6}    Finally, Walsh-Cotton asserted to the trial court that the BZA\u2019s decision\n\ndenying the use variance was not supported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable and\n\nprobative evidence on the whole record. The trial court noted that the BZA determined that\n\nWalsh-Cotton satisfied the requirements for a use variance set forth in R.C.G.O. \u00a7\n\n150.120.10(D)(2)(a)(ii)-(v).   It further noted that the board debated whether or not\n\nWalsh-Cotton satisfied the requirement in R.C.G.O \u00a7 150.120.10(D)(2)(a)(i), namely\n\nwhether or not her variance request stemmed from a condition that is unique to her property\n\nand not ordinarily found in the same zone or district. The court concluded that \u201cthe BZA\u2019s\n\ndecision to deny Ms. Cotton\u2019s request for a use variance was supported by a preponderance\n\f                                                                                          6\n\nof reliable, probative and substantial evidence.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 7}    Walsh-Cotton asserts three assignments of error herein.         For ease of\n\nanalysis, we will consider her second assigned error first. It is as follows:\n\n       THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS ERRED BY NOT FINDING THAT THE\n\n\u201cDECISION, FINAL ORDER AND ENTRY\u201d OF JULY 23, 2012 WAS ILLEGAL\n\nBECAUSE A HEARING ON SAID REQUEST FOR A USE VARIANCE WAS NOT\n\nPROPERLY ADVERTISED AS REQUIRED BY CITY OF DAYTON ORDINANCES.\n\n       {\u00b6 8}     According to Walsh-Cotton, the \u201cnotice of hearing only indicated that there\n\nwould be a hearing on the request for a set-back variance, not the use variance. Thus,\n\nAppellant could not adequately prepare for the hearing.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 9}     As this Court has previously noted:\n\n                Administrative appeals to the court of common pleas are governed by\n\n       R.C. Chapter 2506. In an appeal of an administrative order or decision under\n\n       this chapter, the trial court is authorized to reverse, vacate, or modify the\n\n       administrative order if the court finds the decision is \u201cunconstitutional,\n\n       illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the\n\n       preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.\u201d         R.C.\n\n       2506.04; Parisi v. City of Dayton, Montgomery App. No. 20045,\n\n       2004-Ohio-2739, \u00b6 11. Because the trial court must determine whether the\n\n       decision is supported \u201cby the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and\n\n       probative evidence,\u201d R.C. 2506.04 grants the trial court \u201cextensive power\u201d to\n\n       weigh the evidence.

There being no abuse of discretion, Walsh-Cotton\u2019s second assigned error is\n\noverruled.\n\n          {\u00b6 12} We will next consider Walsh-Cotton\u2019s first and third assigned errors\n\ntogether.

See,\n\nid.\n\n       {\u00b6 15} The following exchange occurred at the hearing:\n\n               MR. CIANI: Mr. Smothers, could we see the standards again for a use\n\n       variance? I think it would be helpful for us to review them. And there are\n\n       five total standards for a use variance; is that correct?\n\n               MR. ISON: It\u2019s now one through five, yes.\n\n               MR. BRACHER: * * * And they all have to be satisfied?\n\n               MR. ISON: Yes, exactly.\n\n               MR. CROFT: By a clear and convincing evidence.\n\n               ***\n\f                                                                                  11\n\n       MR. CIANI: * * * I have the duty and responsibility to discuss use\n\nvariances do put a strong burden on the applicant, and so for that reason I ask\n\nthat we take a look at these individually and as we deliberate, feel free to\n\ncomment on any one of the standards whether you think that there has been\n\nevidence produced that would substantiate or fulfill the requirement of the\n\nstandard, or whether the evidence is contrary to the expectations here.\n\n       Why don\u2019t we go through them one at a time? The variance stems\n\nfrom a condition that is unique to the property at issue and not ordinarily\n\nfound in the same zoned district.\n\n       MR. EVANS: This kind of easement, two accessory structures on that\n\nproperty, you can easily make a case that that\u2019s a unique, if you\u2019re talking\n\nabout at Deweese, where there is you know, five-thousand square foot, but\n\nwe\u2019re talking about a very tight property and that would certainly be unique\n\nthat there are two accessory structures on there.\n\nMR. CIANI: How do others feel about uniqueness?\n\n       MR.BRACHER: But does that particular uniqueness create a hardship\n\nfor the owner? * * *\n\n        ***\n\n       MR. CIANI: So you have some doubt about this - -\n\n       MR. BRACHER: Yeah, I have some difficulty with number one.\n\n       ***\n\n       MR.

I don\u2019t know about anybody else.\n\n       MR. EVANS: I think we\u2019ve mentioned before that having an accessory\n\nbuilding and a garage makes the property unique. But unique to the degree that\n\nthe property owner deserves relief, that\u2019s the question. (Inaudible). So I think\n\nthis one is the potential show stopper, either we can buy into the satisfaction of the\n\nstandard or not.\n\n       MR. CIANI: It seems we\u2019re having trouble getting over this one. * * *\n\n       ***\n\n       MR.

BRACHER:          Yes, it does.\n\n       MR. CIANI: Not unusual, but a one and only. At least - -\n\n       MR. BRACHER: Yeah.\n\n       MR. CIANI: By dictionary, strictly - -\n\n***\n\n       MR.

ISON: For use variance.\n\n       MR. BRACHER: For use variance, thank you.\n\f                                                                                        13\n\n         MR. CIANI: Do you wish to cite Paragraph 1?\n\n         MR. BRACHER: And I would cite Paragraph 1, yes.\n\n         MR. CIANI: Is there a second to that motion?\n\n         MS. GRAHAM: I\u2019ll second it.\n\n         MR. CIANI: Second by Ms. Graham. Will you poll the Board, please?\n\n         MR. ISON: Mr. Evans.\n\n         MR. EVANS: No.\n\n         MR.

That is all we have.\n\n{\u00b6 16}     The written decision of the BZA provides in part:\n\n         After additional deliberation, the Board did not find that strict compliance\n\nwith Zoning Code, would result in unnecessary hardship to the Applicant. Much\n\nof the Board\u2019s discussion focused on an inability to find that the Applicant had\n\ndemonstrated that the variance, that is, the allowance of a home occupation in an\n\naccessory building which is prohibited pursuant to City of Dayton Revised Code\n\f                                                                                         14\n\n       of General Ordinances \u00a7 150.440(B)(6), stems from a condition that is unique to\n\n       the property at issue and not ordinarily found in the same zone or district\n\n       (R.C.G.O. 150.120.10(D)(2)(a)(i).\n\n       {\u00b6 17}    We initially note that the trial court indicated that Mr. Ison voted \u201cno\u201d on the\n\nuse variance, which is inaccurate. Mr. Ison is the board secretary and not a voting member of\n\nthe board. This mischaracterization of the record, however, does not affect the outcome herein.\n\nWhile Walsh-Cotton contends that the BZA determined that her property is unique, based upon\n\nthe initial comments of Mr. Evans above, we note that Mr. Evans voted with the majority\n\nregarding the use variance, and that the above exchange suggests that the majority found\n\nWalsh-Cotton\u2019s property to be unusual but not unique. We agree with the trial court that while\n\nthe BZA \u201ctechnically\u201d voted against disapproving the use variance, Mr. Ison clearly expressed\n\nthe board members\u2019 intention at the hearing to deny the use variance at the conclusion of the 3-1\n\nvote. Further, the BZA expressly declined to find that strict compliance with the zoning code\n\nwill result in an unnecessary hardship to Walsh-Cotton, as required by R.C.G.O.\n\n150.120.10(D)(2), before a use variance can be granted. In other words, there is no discrepancy\n\nbetween the BZA\u2019s intent and its written decision. We conclude that the trial court correctly\n\naffirmed the BZA\u2019s decision that Walsh-Cotton failed to meet the requirement of R.C.G.O. \u00a7\n\n150.120.10(D)(2)(a)(i) with clear and convincing evidence.       Walsh-Cotton\u2019s first and third\n\nassigned errors are overruled.\n\n       {\u00b6 18} Having overruled all of Walsh-Cotton\u2019s assigned errors, the judgment of the trial\n\ncourt is affirmed.\n\n                                           ..........\n\f[Cite as Oregon Place Assn. v.
