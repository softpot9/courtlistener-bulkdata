The children were detained and\nplaced with a relative.\n                          A. The Court\u2019s Jurisdictional Ruling\n       At the September 2014 jurisdictional hearing, father and mother pleaded no\ncontest to amended petition allegations and stipulated that the allegations constituted a\nbasis for the court to assume jurisdiction. These allegations were that mother and father\nhad not provided adequate and consistent medical care for their children in specified\nways and had pervasive substance abuse problems that impaired their ability to parent, in\nthat they were using methamphetamine and marijuana.\n       In connection with the jurisdictional hearing, father (and his counsel) executed a\n\u201cwaiver of rights\u201d form. Father indicated on the form that he understood the amended\npetition and was pleading no contest to the allegations. Under a section entitled\n\u201cConsequences,\u201d he initialed a statement that read, \u201cI understand that if the petition is\nfound to be true and the child is declared a dependent of the court, the court may assume\ncustody of the child[.]\u201d The remainder of the sentence, which had indicated that it was\npossible that no reunification services would be offered or provided, was crossed out by\nhand. In its place, it was handwritten, \u201cReunification services will be offered to this\nparent.\u201d\n       The court\u2019s written order for the jurisdictional hearing states that the court read\nand explained the allegations of the petition. The order also states that the court advised\nthe parents of the possible consequences of admitting allegations of the petition, mother\n\n\n                                              2\n\fand father stated \u201cno threats, inducements or promises were made by anyone re dispo of\ncharges in petition,\u201d and mother and father made intelligent waivers of their rights.\n                            B. The Court\u2019s Disposition Ruling\n       At the request of minors\u2019 counsel, the juvenile court held a contested disposition\nhearing. As we will discuss, minors\u2019 counsel argued that the court should bypass\nreunification services for both parents pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (13).\n       The Bureau submitted an October 29, 2014 disposition report in which it reported\non both parents and made recommendations. According to the Bureau, mother had\n\u201cjumped right into working on her Court ordered case plan.\u201d She was attending a\nrecovery program five days a week and had begun random drug testing. She had tested\nnegative three times, missed two testing dates that were treated as positive results, and\nhad been advised not to miss any more testing dates. Mother reported that she had started\nworking full-time as a waitress and was saving money to secure housing for her children.\nThe Bureau had had limited contact with father, who was enrolled in an inpatient\nresidential treatment program that required a two- month communications \u201cblack-out\u201d\nperiod. The Bureau recommended that the children remain in out-of-home care and\nfamily reunification services be provided to mother and father.\n       The contested disposition hearing began on December 8, 2014. The Bureau\u2019s case\nworker and the author of its disposition report, Alesha Jones, testified. Along with what\nwe have already summarized from the disposition report, Jones testified that mother had\nbeen visiting the children weekly, but missed a visit over Thanksgiving after reporting to\nJones that she would be gone for two weeks. During that time, mother missed a drug test\nwithout excuse. Mother was attending her treatment program three to five days a week as\nrequired, was attending Narcotics Anonymous (NA) programs, and had previously\ncompleted a drug program as part of a previous dependency case.\n       Jones testified that father had participated in drug testing in his residential\ntreatment program, but had not tested with the Bureau. Jones had left numerous\nmessages for him, which father said he had not received. She said father was actively\nengaged in treatment.\n\n\n                                               3\n\f       Jones continued to recommend reunification services for mother and father. She\nthought the children had healthy attachments to their parents.\n       At minors\u2019 counsel\u2019s request, the court took judicial notice of three adult criminal\nfiles. In the first, case number 4-147155-6, the criminal court in 2006 placed father on\nprobation for a felony, the unlawful possession of a controlled substance, and required\nthat he participate in treatment and testing. He was found repeatedly to have failed to\nparticipate in court-ordered drug treatment and his probation was terminated\nunsuccessfully later in 2006.\n       In the second, case number 4-175899-4, father was charged in April 2013 and\nconvicted in May 2013 of felony possession of methamphetamine, placed on two years\nprobation, and required to register as a narcotics offender, participate in testing and\nsubmit to search and seizure. He was found in violation of probation twice in that case,\nresulting in additional county jail time, and ordered to participate in counseling. He\ntested positive for methamphetamine on April 1 and April 11, 2014. This case was active\nand open.\n       In the third case, case number 4-150742-5, mother pleaded guilty to a\nmisdemeanor, the unlawful possession of methamphetamine, and was ordered to\nparticipate in a drug treatment program, among other things. In June 2008, the court\nfound that mother had successfully completed the program. The case was later\ndismissed.\n       The court continued the hearing to January 21, 2015, for lack of time. The Bureau\nsubmitted a January 16, 2015 update memorandum with the court. The Bureau had had\nno contact with father after a December 2014 court hearing and his treatment program\ndirector reported that father had not attended the program since late November 2014.\nMother\u2019s drug and alcohol counselor said mother had poor attendance in\nNovember 2014, attending treatment for only two days that month. She did not attend\nthe program in December 2014 until the 10th of that month; after she was warned that she\nwould be discharged, she met with her counselor and \u201cwas put on a contract.\u201d After that,\nshe missed \u201cfour days which were excused due to mother reporting that she was \u2018burnt\n\n\n                                              4\n\fout on work\u2019 \u201d and participated actively in January. She had three negative tests and a\nmissed test in each of November and December 2014, and had one negative test in\nJanuary 2015. The Bureau recommended certain case plan modifications and continued\nto recommend reunification services for both parents.\n       At the January 21, 2015 session of the contested disposition hearing, the Bureau\nsubmitted its update memorandum for the court\u2019s consideration. At minors\u2019 counsel\u2019s\nrequest, the court took judicial notice of court findings and orders in a previous 2007\ndependency case involving the family. Minors\u2019 counsel also indicated that father had\nbeen arrested on an outstanding warrant. She asked the court to bypass reunification\nservices for both parents in light of their failed participation in substance abuse treatment.\n       Mother testified at the hearing. She said she had a drug addiction, had not used\nillegal substances since August 6, 2014, and had engaged in outpatient services and NA\nmeetings two or three times a week since September 17, 2014. She was now on level two\nof NA. She had also connected with friends who were clean and sober, was working and\nwas engaged in Bible study.\n       Mother acknowledged that she had completed treatment programs as a part of her\nprevious dependency case. Although she had relapsed, she believed she could maintain\nher sobriety if given the opportunity to reunify with her children. She \u201cwas young and\nstupid then,\u201d but now wanted more to be with her children. If the court required it, she\nwould be willing to participate in an inpatient program as well. She was seeing her\nchildren about once a week for about three hours and spoke with them by phone about\nonce a week as well. She was not currently in a relationship with father and would be\nwilling to remain in that status if it improved her chances of reunification with her\nchildren.\n       On cross-examination by minors\u2019 counsel, mother said she had visited her\ngrandmother in Alameda, California for two weeks around Thanksgiving 2014. She did\nnot see her children and was not aware that she missed a drug test during that time. She\nalso acknowledged missing \u201ca couple of Fridays\u201d of her drug treatment program,\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\ftestifying that it was because she worked late Thursday nights. However, her work\nschedule had changed and she now realized the treatment program was more important.\n       Mother also testified that around 2007 and 2008, she completed an outpatient drug\ntreatment program as ordered by the criminal court and another as ordered by the juvenile\ncourt. Her children were returned to her custody around September 2008. She registered\nfor a Rubicon program in 2014, but could not attend because she started a job.\n       She acknowledged missing a few drug tests in November 2014, but said she now\nwoke up every morning and checked on whether she was required to test. She was\ntesting weekly in her outpatient drug treatment program and to her knowledge had not\ntested positive.\n       In closing argument, minors\u2019 counsel argued that the court should bypass\nreunification services for both parents pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13).\nCounsel for mother, father and the Bureau were of the view that reunification services\nshould be provided.\n       The court denied both parents family reunification services pursuant to\nsection 361.5, subdivision (b)(13). In doing so, it noted the previous cases of which it\nhad taken judicial notice,and noted that in the present case, the parents failed to meet the\n                                                      3\nsignificant medical needs of their oldest child, Josef, and were found to have pervasive\nsubstance abuse problems. The court also pointed out that, as reported by the Bureau in\nits jurisdictional report, mother at first denied having a history of using any substance\nother than marijuana.\n       The court then discussed the Bureau\u2019s disposition report and January 2015 update\nmemorandum. It noted that mother had not regularly participated in testing and had\nfailed to consistently participate in her outpatient program, father was appearing at the\n\n\n       3\n          At the jurisdictional hearing, the parents pleaded no contest to, and the court\nsustained, the allegations that Josef had been diagnosed with hearing loss in April 2012,\nhad not shown up thereafter for many related appointments, had not followed through\nwhen referred for surgery for tubing in his ears in January 2013 and had last been seen\nfor his ears in December 2012.\n\n\n                                              6\n\fhearing in custody because of a probation violation in a case involving substance abuse,\nand the two school-age children, Josef and Julian, had each missed school days or were\ntardy for dozens of days in the last year.\n       The court was perplexed by the Bureau\u2019s recommendation of reunification\nservices under the circumstances. It asserted that section 361.5, subdivision (b) (13) was\nintended for cases such as the one before it, \u201cwhere children are in and out of court\nproceedings, where they have no stability in their lives because of their parents\u2019 chronic\nsubstance abuse problems. When I see attendance records at school like that, children not\neating, children not getting their basic medical needs met\u2014I will not order services in\nthis case on this history and this record.\u201d\n       The court specifically found that the reunification services bypass allowed in\nsection 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) applied \u201ccertainly\u201d because of the parents\u2019 past\nresistance to court-ordered treatment of their substance abuse problems and \u201carguably\u201d\nbecause of their repeated failure to participate in the treatment ordered by the court in the\npresent case, which, as stated in section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13), is also a ground for\n                                         4\ndenying a parent reunification services. The court further ruled that there was not clear\nand convincing evidence that reunification was in the best interests of the children.\nSubsequently, the court issued a written order in which it denied the parents family\nreunification services pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) both because of their\npast resistance to court-ordered treatment and their repeated failure to participate in the\ntreatment ordered by the court in the present case.\n       The court informed the parents of their right to seek a writ petition from this court\nand of a hearing pursuant to section 366.26 scheduled for May 18, 2015. The parents\u2019\n\n       4\n          This other portion of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) states that\n\u201c[r]eunification services need not be provided to a parent . . . when the juvenile court\nfinds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent \u201chas a history of extensive,\nabusive, and chronic use of drugs . . . [and] has failed or refused to comply with a\nprogram of drug or alcohol treatment described in the case plan required by Section 358.1\non at least two prior occasions, even though the programs identified were available and\naccessible.\u201d\n\n\n                                              7\n\fwrit petitions and requests for stays followed. By order filed on March 13, 2015, this\ncourt issued an order to show cause and denied mother\u2019s and father\u2019s requests to stay the\nMay 18, 2015 hearing pending the outcome of their petitions. No responses to the\npetitions have been filed.\n                                            II.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n                             A. Father\u2019s Petition Arguments\n       Father argues we should grant his petition for two reasons, neither of which is\npersuasive.\n       1. Father Has Not Established That He Should Be Allowed to Withdraw His\n          No Contest Plea.\n\n       Father first argues that he pleaded no contest to the amended petition allegations at\nthe jurisdictional hearing because, as indicated on his waiver form, he understood that he\nwould receive family reunification services and that the court was required to provide\nthese services. Since the court did not, he should be allowed to withdraw his no contest\nplea. We conclude father has not established the court was required to provide him with\nreunification services based on his waiver form.\n       Specifically, father argues that (1) \u201c[t]he court found the parents made a knowing\nand intelligent waiver of their rights and that they understood the possible consequences\u201d\nas required by California Rules of Court, rule 5.682(e); (2) the waiver form\nunambiguously indicated that he was to be provided reunification services; (3) the\njuvenile court \u201caccepted the form thereby binding it\u201d (a proposition for which he cites no\nlegal authority); (4) we should not conclude he waived his appellate claim by not first\nraising it in the court below, citing California Rules of Court, rule 5.682(e) and Arlena M.\nv. Superior Court (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 566, 569; and (5) we should conclude the error\nis reversible per se pursuant to Arlena M. and remand the matter so that he can be\n\u201callowed to withdraw his plea or get the benefit of his plea and receive reunification\nservices.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       We do not need to address more than father\u2019s first three points. Father is correct\nthat the court found that he and mother made a knowing and intelligent waiver of their\nrights and understood the possible consequences of their waiver, but the court\u2019s findings\nwork against, rather than support, his claim. The court\u2019s written order for the\njurisdictional hearing indicates that mother and father made intelligent waivers of their\nrights after the court advised them of the possible consequences of admitting allegations\nof the petition, and mother and father stated that \u201cno threats, inducements or promises\nwere made by anyone re dispo of charges in petition.\u201d (Italics added.) This finding\nindicates that the court did not bind itself to any agreement or promise to provide\nreunification services, and that father did not reasonably rely on any such agreement or\npromise in pleading no contest.\n       Father does not address this finding, nor point to anything in the record or in law\nthat indicates the juvenile court obligated itself to provide reunification services (the\nrecord indicates only that the form was filed with the court on the same day as the\nhearing). Indeed, father has not provided a reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing, which\npresumably would shed further light on the subject, although \u201c[o]rdinarily in writ\nproceedings the petitioner has the burden of furnishing a sufficient record.\u201d (Tex-Cal\nLand Management v. Agric. Labor Relations Bd. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 335, 351.)\n       \u201c[W]e presume that a judgment or order of the lower court is correct, \u2018 \u201c[a]ll\nintendments and presumptions are indulged to support it on matters as to which the\nrecord is silent, and error must be affirmatively shown.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (People v. Giordano (2007)\n42 Cal.4th 644, 666.) The petitioner bears the burden of affirmatively showing error on\nthe record. (Denham v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564.) We conclude, based\non the record before us, that father has failed to meet his burden here.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       2. Substantial Evidence Supports the Court\u2019s Denial of Family Reunification\n          Services to Father Pursuant to Section 361.5, Subdivision (b)(13).\n       Father next argues that, even if the juvenile court could deny him family\nreunification services pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13), it should have\nordered that he receive them. We disagree.\n       As we have stated, section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) allows the juvenile court to\ndeny a parent family reunification services based on, among other things, clear and\nconvincing evidence that the parent has a history of extensive, abusive and chronic use of\ndrugs and has resisted prior court-ordered treatment for such a problem during the three-\nyear period prior to the filing of the petition before the court.\n       \u201cWe affirm an order denying reunification services if the order is supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d (In re Harmony B. (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 831, 839 [addressing\ndenial pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(10)].) \u201c \u2018In making this determination,\nwe must decide if the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, such that a\nreasonable trier of fact could find the court\u2019s order was proper based on clear and\nconvincing evidence.\u2019 \u201d (Id. at pp. 839-840.)\n       Father does not challenge the court\u2019s finding that he had a pervasive substance\nabuse problem that impaired his ability to parent. He acknowledges that he was in a\ncourt-ordered drug treatment program in 2006, via the criminal court, and that this\nsatisfies the section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) requirement based on In re Brian M.\n(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1398.\n       However, father argues, he did not \u201cresist\u201d prior court-ordered treatment as\nrequired by the first portion of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13). He contends that the\nonly evidence in the record of \u201cresistance\u201d is his May 2013 felony conviction for\npossession of methamphetamine and an April 2014 positive test for methamphetamine\nand THC. He contends that a mere relapse does not satisfy the \u201cresistance of treatment\u201d\nstandard, as indicated by the far more extensive drug use discussed in Laura B. v.\nSuperior Court (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 776, 780 (Laura B.).\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f       We disagree. The record contains sufficient evidence to satisfy the \u201cresistance to\ntreatment\u201d standard contained in section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13). As indicated in In re\nBrian M., \u201cresistance to treatment\u201d can include return to substance abuse after completion\nof a rehabilitation program. (In re Brian M., supra, 82 Cal.App.4th at p. 1402, citing\nRandi R. v. Superior Court (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 67, 73.) As indicated in Laura B., the\ncase cited by father, proof of resistance can \u201ccome in the form of dropping out of\nprograms, but it may also come in the form of resumption of regular drug use after a\nperiod of sobriety.\u201d (Laura B., supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 780; cf., Karen H. v. Superior\nCourt (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 501, 504 [\u201c[h]ad there been a single positive test or even\nseveral positive tests within a period of a few days, petitioner\u2019s drug use might have been\nconsidered only a relapse\u201d].) \u201cThe parents . . . can passively resist by participating in\ntreatment but nonetheless continuing to abuse drugs and alcohol, thus demonstrating an\ninability to use skills and behaviors taught in the program to maintain a sober life.\u201d\n(Karen S. v. Superior Court (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1006, 1010 (Karen S.).) By resisting\ntreatment, the parent has demonstrated that reunification services \u201cwould be a fruitless\nattempt to protect the child because the parent\u2019s past failure to benefit from treatment\nindicates that future treatment also would fail to change the parent\u2019s destructive\nbehavior.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       The record indicates that from April 2013 to August 2014, when the Bureau filed\nits dependency petition, father was convicted of felony possession of methamphetamine,\ntested positive twice in April 2014 for methamphetamine use, and, as the court found at\nthe September 2014 jurisdiction hearing, had a \u201cpervasive substance abuse problem\nwhich impair[ed] his ability to parent\u201d in that he was using \u201cmethamphetamine and\nmarijuana.\u201d This record shows more than an isolated relapse. The court could\nreasonably infer from this evidence that father was engaging in regular substance abuse\nduring this period, which came after he previously failed to participate in court-ordered\ndrug treatment in connection with his 2006 felony drug conviction, satisfying the\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f\u201cresistance to treatment\u201d part of the section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) test. Father\u2019s\n                                                                                   5\nargument to the contrary is unpersuasive in light of this substantial evidence.\n       3. Father\u2019s \u201cBest Interests\u201d Argument Lacks Merit.\n       Father also argues that, even if his substance abuse came within the parameters of\nsection 361.5, subdivision (b)(13), the court should not have denied him reunification\nservices because \u201creunification is in the best interests of the children.\u201d\nFather\u2019s argument states, but then disregards, the legal standard the juvenile court was to\napply and ignores altogether the scope of our review of the court\u2019s finding.\n       Generally, in a dependency proceeding, the children\u2019s best interests are held\nparamount. (E.g., In re Tiffany G. (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 443, 450 [stating \u201cwe are\nobliged to hold paramount [the children\u2019s] best interests\u201d and \u201cconsider the dependency\nlaw\u2019s objective of protecting them\u201d].) \u201cIn enacting section 361.5, subdivision (b), the\nLegislature determined that, in certain situations, \u2018attempts to facilitate reunification do\nnot serve and protect the child\u2019s interest.\u2019 [Citation.] Situations listed in that subdivision\nconstitute circumstances in which the Legislature has recognized that \u2018it may be fruitless\nto provide reunification services . . . .\u2019 \u201d (Karen S., supra, 69 Cal.App.4th at p. 1010.)\n       The Legislature provided that when a court makes a finding meriting denial of\nfamily reunification services to a parent pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13),\nthe court may further consider the best interests of the child, but \u201cshall not order\nreunification for a parent . . . described in paragraph . . . (13) . . . of subdivision (b) unless\nthe court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that reunification is in the best interest\nof the child.\u201d (\u00a7 361.5, subd. (c), italics added.) The court\u2019s statement at the end of the\n       5\n         The trial court also stated at the disposition hearing that father and mother\n\u201carguably\u201d violated the other ground for denying reunification services stated in section\n361.5, subdivision (b)(13), regarding the repeated failure to comply with treatment\nordered pursuant to a case plan in the current case, and stated that they had done so in its\nsubsequent written order. Father does not address this portion of the juvenile court\u2019s\nruling and mother only refers to it in one sentence, when she contends there was no\nevidence that she failed to comply with a drug program on at least two prior occasions.\nWe do not address whether father and mother also violated this portion of section 361.5,\nsubdivision (b)(13) in light of our conclusions about their petition claims.\n\n\n                                               12\n\fdisposition hearing that there was not clear and convincing evidence that ordering\nreunification services was in the best interests of the children appears to have been made\nwith this provision in mind.\n       Father argues the juvenile court should have ordered reunification services\n                                                                        6\npursuant to the standard contained in section 361.5, subdivision (c), i.e., he contends\nreunification was in the best interest of the children. He contends the record indicates\nthat all of the children knew him, had a healthy attachment to him and wanted to be with\nhim; that at the October 2014 disposition hearing session he was in a residential treatment\nprogram, thereby indicating his desire and effort to reunify with his children; and that,\nalthough he was in custody at the January 2015 disposition hearing session, this was not a\nnew arrest, but because of a probation violation relating to his drug use in April 2014. He\npoints out that the Bureau recommended that he receive reunification services and that\neven minors\u2019 counsel did not argue that the children did not want to be with their parents.\n       Father\u2019s arguments ignore the substantial evidence relied on by the court and\ncontained in the record indicating there was not clear and convincing evidence that\nreunification was in the children\u2019s best interests. He leaves unaddressed the major\nconcerns that the juvenile court referred to in its ruling, such as the lack of stability in the\nchildren\u2019s lives as a result of the parents\u2019 chronic substance abuse problems, that the\nparents had failed to participate in drug treatment in the present case (father having left\nhis residential treatment program in late November 2014), the children\u2019s poor school\nattendance record, their problems getting enough to eat and the lack of attention to their\nbasic medical needs. He also ignores other facts in the record, including parents\u2019 history\nof failing to obtain medical care for the children, leading to Julian\u2019s hospitalization, the\nrepeated expulsions of the family from shelters and the injuries to three-year-old Josiah.\nFather does not explain why this evidence is insufficient to support the court\u2019s\ndetermination that there was not clear and convincing evidence that reunification was in\n\n\n       6\n         Father incorrectly states the standard is contained in section 361.5, subdivision\n(b)(13), but correctly states the standard.\n\n\n                                               13\n\fthe children\u2019s best interests. We conclude that it is sufficient based on the record before\nus.\n                             B. Mother\u2019s Petition Arguments\n       1. The Petition Allegations and Substantial Evidence Support the Juvenile\n          Court\u2019s Denial of Reunification Services to Mother.\n       Mother first argues that the sustained petition allegations are the only basis for the\ncourt\u2019s denial of family reunification services to her and legally insufficient to meet the\nrequirements of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13). We disagree.\n       As we have discussed, the juvenile court denied mother reunification services\npursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13), which allows the court to do so based on,\namong other things, clear and convincing evidence that she had a history of extensive,\nabusive and chronic use of drugs and has resisted prior court-ordered treatment for her\nproblem during the three-year period prior to the filing of the petition before the court.\n       Mother argues that there was no finding by the court that she had a history of\nextensive, abusive, and chronic drug and alcohol use or had resisted treatment, that \u201cthe\nfailure of the petition to allege these facts precluded the court from making these findings\nand, hence, \u201cthere was insufficient evidence\u201d for the court to apply section 361.5,\nsubdivision (b)(13). Most specifically, she contends the juvenile court\u2019s sustaining of the\nallegation that she had a \u201cpervasive substance abuse problem which impairs her ability to\nparent in that . . . mother admits to using methamphetamine and marijuana\u201d is \u201clegally\ninsufficient to constitute chronic, habitual drug abuse,\u201d particularly in light of the finding\nthat she was only \u201cusing\u201d methamphetamine and marijuana.\n       Mother does not cite any legal authority for her argument and it is not persuasive.\nThe word \u201cpervade\u201d means \u201cto become diffused throughout every part of: spread\nthroughout.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (2002) p. 1688.) \u201cPervasive\u201d refers to\nsomething \u201cthat pervades or tends to pervade esp[ecially] in such a way as to be or\nbecome prevalent or dominant.\u201d (Ibid.) Given these expansive definitions, we see no\nreason why a \u201cpervasive\u201d use of methamphetamine and marijuana cannot encompass a\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fhistory of extensive, abusive and chronic use of drugs as required by section 361.5,\nsubdivision (b)(13).\n       Furthermore, there was other evidence before the court that mother had an\nextensive, abusive and chronic drug use history and had \u201cresisted\u201d prior court-ordered\ntreatment within the past three years prior to the filing of the petition. The Bureau, in its\ndisposition report, stated that father and mother \u201c[t]ogether . . . have had a chronic pattern\nof marijuana and methamphetamine abuse over the years.\u201d At the disposition hearing,\nthe juvenile court took judicial notice of mother\u2019s pleading guilty in 2008 to\nmisdemeanor possession of methamphetamine, and that she had completed a court-\nordered treatment program that same year. Mother testified to having completed that\nprogram and another ordered as part of a dependency case in 2007 or 2008. Mother also\ntestified that she had \u201ca drug addiction\u201d and \u201cwas unable to care for\u201d her children. She\nsaid she had been sober since August 6, 2014, thereby indicating that she was not sober\nprior to that time.\n       This evidence\u2014none of which mother contested\u2014and the court\u2019s finding that\nmother\u2019s parenting was impaired because she had a \u201cpervasive\u201d drug problem due to her\nuse of methamphetamine and marijuana, is substantial evidence of clear and convincing\nevidence satisfying the requirements of section 361, subdivision (b)(13). Furthermore,\nthe court relied on this evidence to deny mother reunification services. It referred to,\namong other things, the \u201cparents\u2019 chronic substance abuse problems\u201d and found that\nsection 361, subdivision (b)(13) applied based \u201con this history and this record.\u201d\nTherefore, mother\u2019s \u201clegally insufficient\u201d argument lacks merit.\n       Mother also argues that the juvenile court abused its discretion in denying her\nreunification services because the Bureau did not request denial and the court\u2019s order was\ninconsistent with the best interests of the children. Mother contends that she was in\nsubstantial compliance with every component of her case plan and had a strong parent-\nchild bond with her children, that reunification services would be beneficial to her\nchildren and that the Legislature in enacting the juvenile dependency statutes indicated in\nsection 300.2 that families should be preserved whenever possible.\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       Mother\u2019s arguments ignore both the substantial evidence in support of the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s denial of reunification pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) and the\nLegislature\u2019s purpose in enacting this exception, both of which we have already\ndiscussed. Mother does not establish that the juvenile court abused its discretion.\n       2. The Juvenile Court Did Not Improperly Shift the Burden of Proof.\n       Finally, mother argues that the juvenile court improperly shifted the burden of\nproof to her, rather than the Bureau, when the court found there was not clear and\nconvincing evidence that reunification was in the best interests of the children. She notes\nthere is a general presumption in favor of reunification services, as stated in Riverside\nCounty Dept. of Public Social Services v. Superior Court (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 483,\n487, and contends the court\u2019s denial was improperly based entirely on this purportedly\nimproper finding.\n       Mother\u2019s argument is without merit. As we have discussed, the court\u2019s ruling was\nbased on clear and convincing evidence that satisfied section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13).\nThe court\u2019s finding of a lack of clear and convincing evidence that reunification was in\nthe best interests of the children appears to be in order to satisfy section 361.5,\nsubdivision (c)\u2019s instruction that \u201c[t]he court shall not order reunification for a parent . . .\ndescribed in paragraph . . . (13) . . . of subdivision (b) unless the court finds, by clear and\nconvincing evidence, that reunification is in the best interest of the child.\u201d (Italics\nadded.) We see no reason to disagree with this ruling.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       Mother\u2019s and father\u2019s petitions for extraordinary writs are denied on their merits.\nThis opinion is final as to this court immediately.

The children were detained and\nplaced with a relative.\n                          A. The Court\u2019s Jurisdictional Ruling\n       At the September 2014 jurisdictional hearing, father and mother pleaded no\ncontest to amended petition allegations and stipulated that the allegations constituted a\nbasis for the court to assume jurisdiction. These allegations were that mother and father\nhad not provided adequate and consistent medical care for their children in specified\nways and had pervasive substance abuse problems that impaired their ability to parent, in\nthat they were using methamphetamine and marijuana.\n       In connection with the jurisdictional hearing, father (and his counsel) executed a\n\u201cwaiver of rights\u201d form. Father indicated on the form that he understood the amended\npetition and was pleading no contest to the allegations. Under a section entitled\n\u201cConsequences,\u201d he initialed a statement that read, \u201cI understand that if the petition is\nfound to be true and the child is declared a dependent of the court, the court may assume\ncustody of the child[.]\u201d The remainder of the sentence, which had indicated that it was\npossible that no reunification services would be offered or provided, was crossed out by\nhand. In its place, it was handwritten, \u201cReunification services will be offered to this\nparent.\u201d\n       The court\u2019s written order for the jurisdictional hearing states that the court read\nand explained the allegations of the petition. The order also states that the court advised\nthe parents of the possible consequences of admitting allegations of the petition, mother\n\n\n                                              2\n\fand father stated \u201cno threats, inducements or promises were made by anyone re dispo of\ncharges in petition,\u201d and mother and father made intelligent waivers of their rights.\n                            B. The Court\u2019s Disposition Ruling\n       At the request of minors\u2019 counsel, the juvenile court held a contested disposition\nhearing. As we will discuss, minors\u2019 counsel argued that the court should bypass\nreunification services for both parents pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (13).\n       The Bureau submitted an October 29, 2014 disposition report in which it reported\non both parents and made recommendations. According to the Bureau, mother had\n\u201cjumped right into working on her Court ordered case plan.\u201d She was attending a\nrecovery program five days a week and had begun random drug testing. She had tested\nnegative three times, missed two testing dates that were treated as positive results, and\nhad been advised not to miss any more testing dates. Mother reported that she had started\nworking full-time as a waitress and was saving money to secure housing for her children.\nThe Bureau had had limited contact with father, who was enrolled in an inpatient\nresidential treatment program that required a two- month communications \u201cblack-out\u201d\nperiod. The Bureau recommended that the children remain in out-of-home care and\nfamily reunification services be provided to mother and father.\n       The contested disposition hearing began on December 8, 2014. The Bureau\u2019s case\nworker and the author of its disposition report, Alesha Jones, testified. Along with what\nwe have already summarized from the disposition report, Jones testified that mother had\nbeen visiting the children weekly, but missed a visit over Thanksgiving after reporting to\nJones that she would be gone for two weeks. During that time, mother missed a drug test\nwithout excuse. Mother was attending her treatment program three to five days a week as\nrequired, was attending Narcotics Anonymous (NA) programs, and had previously\ncompleted a drug program as part of a previous dependency case.\n       Jones testified that father had participated in drug testing in his residential\ntreatment program, but had not tested with the Bureau. Jones had left numerous\nmessages for him, which father said he had not received. She said father was actively\nengaged in treatment.\n\n\n                                               3\n\f       Jones continued to recommend reunification services for mother and father. She\nthought the children had healthy attachments to their parents.\n       At minors\u2019 counsel\u2019s request, the court took judicial notice of three adult criminal\nfiles. In the first, case number 4-147155-6, the criminal court in 2006 placed father on\nprobation for a felony, the unlawful possession of a controlled substance, and required\nthat he participate in treatment and testing. He was found repeatedly to have failed to\nparticipate in court-ordered drug treatment and his probation was terminated\nunsuccessfully later in 2006.\n       In the second, case number 4-175899-4, father was charged in April 2013 and\nconvicted in May 2013 of felony possession of methamphetamine, placed on two years\nprobation, and required to register as a narcotics offender, participate in testing and\nsubmit to search and seizure. He was found in violation of probation twice in that case,\nresulting in additional county jail time, and ordered to participate in counseling. He\ntested positive for methamphetamine on April 1 and April 11, 2014. This case was active\nand open.\n       In the third case, case number 4-150742-5, mother pleaded guilty to a\nmisdemeanor, the unlawful possession of methamphetamine, and was ordered to\nparticipate in a drug treatment program, among other things. In June 2008, the court\nfound that mother had successfully completed the program. The case was later\ndismissed.\n       The court continued the hearing to January 21, 2015, for lack of time. The Bureau\nsubmitted a January 16, 2015 update memorandum with the court. The Bureau had had\nno contact with father after a December 2014 court hearing and his treatment program\ndirector reported that father had not attended the program since late November 2014.\nMother\u2019s drug and alcohol counselor said mother had poor attendance in\nNovember 2014, attending treatment for only two days that month. She did not attend\nthe program in December 2014 until the 10th of that month; after she was warned that she\nwould be discharged, she met with her counselor and \u201cwas put on a contract.\u201d After that,\nshe missed \u201cfour days which were excused due to mother reporting that she was \u2018burnt\n\n\n                                              4\n\fout on work\u2019 \u201d and participated actively in January. She had three negative tests and a\nmissed test in each of November and December 2014, and had one negative test in\nJanuary 2015. The Bureau recommended certain case plan modifications and continued\nto recommend reunification services for both parents.\n       At the January 21, 2015 session of the contested disposition hearing, the Bureau\nsubmitted its update memorandum for the court\u2019s consideration. At minors\u2019 counsel\u2019s\nrequest, the court took judicial notice of court findings and orders in a previous 2007\ndependency case involving the family. Minors\u2019 counsel also indicated that father had\nbeen arrested on an outstanding warrant. She asked the court to bypass reunification\nservices for both parents in light of their failed participation in substance abuse treatment.\n       Mother testified at the hearing. She said she had a drug addiction, had not used\nillegal substances since August 6, 2014, and had engaged in outpatient services and NA\nmeetings two or three times a week since September 17, 2014. She was now on level two\nof NA. She had also connected with friends who were clean and sober, was working and\nwas engaged in Bible study.\n       Mother acknowledged that she had completed treatment programs as a part of her\nprevious dependency case. Although she had relapsed, she believed she could maintain\nher sobriety if given the opportunity to reunify with her children. She \u201cwas young and\nstupid then,\u201d but now wanted more to be with her children. If the court required it, she\nwould be willing to participate in an inpatient program as well. She was seeing her\nchildren about once a week for about three hours and spoke with them by phone about\nonce a week as well. She was not currently in a relationship with father and would be\nwilling to remain in that status if it improved her chances of reunification with her\nchildren.\n       On cross-examination by minors\u2019 counsel, mother said she had visited her\ngrandmother in Alameda, California for two weeks around Thanksgiving 2014. She did\nnot see her children and was not aware that she missed a drug test during that time. She\nalso acknowledged missing \u201ca couple of Fridays\u201d of her drug treatment program,\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\ftestifying that it was because she worked late Thursday nights. However, her work\nschedule had changed and she now realized the treatment program was more important.\n       Mother also testified that around 2007 and 2008, she completed an outpatient drug\ntreatment program as ordered by the criminal court and another as ordered by the juvenile\ncourt. Her children were returned to her custody around September 2008. She registered\nfor a Rubicon program in 2014, but could not attend because she started a job.\n       She acknowledged missing a few drug tests in November 2014, but said she now\nwoke up every morning and checked on whether she was required to test. She was\ntesting weekly in her outpatient drug treatment program and to her knowledge had not\ntested positive.\n       In closing argument, minors\u2019 counsel argued that the court should bypass\nreunification services for both parents pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13).\nCounsel for mother, father and the Bureau were of the view that reunification services\nshould be provided.\n       The court denied both parents family reunification services pursuant to\nsection 361.5, subdivision (b)(13). In doing so, it noted the previous cases of which it\nhad taken judicial notice,and noted that in the present case, the parents failed to meet the\n                                                      3\nsignificant medical needs of their oldest child, Josef, and were found to have pervasive\nsubstance abuse problems. The court also pointed out that, as reported by the Bureau in\nits jurisdictional report, mother at first denied having a history of using any substance\nother than marijuana.\n       The court then discussed the Bureau\u2019s disposition report and January 2015 update\nmemorandum. It noted that mother had not regularly participated in testing and had\nfailed to consistently participate in her outpatient program, father was appearing at the\n\n\n       3\n          At the jurisdictional hearing, the parents pleaded no contest to, and the court\nsustained, the allegations that Josef had been diagnosed with hearing loss in April 2012,\nhad not shown up thereafter for many related appointments, had not followed through\nwhen referred for surgery for tubing in his ears in January 2013 and had last been seen\nfor his ears in December 2012.\n\n\n                                              6\n\fhearing in custody because of a probation violation in a case involving substance abuse,\nand the two school-age children, Josef and Julian, had each missed school days or were\ntardy for dozens of days in the last year.\n       The court was perplexed by the Bureau\u2019s recommendation of reunification\nservices under the circumstances. It asserted that section 361.5, subdivision (b) (13) was\nintended for cases such as the one before it, \u201cwhere children are in and out of court\nproceedings, where they have no stability in their lives because of their parents\u2019 chronic\nsubstance abuse problems. When I see attendance records at school like that, children not\neating, children not getting their basic medical needs met\u2014I will not order services in\nthis case on this history and this record.\u201d\n       The court specifically found that the reunification services bypass allowed in\nsection 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) applied \u201ccertainly\u201d because of the parents\u2019 past\nresistance to court-ordered treatment of their substance abuse problems and \u201carguably\u201d\nbecause of their repeated failure to participate in the treatment ordered by the court in the\npresent case, which, as stated in section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13), is also a ground for\n                                         4\ndenying a parent reunification services. The court further ruled that there was not clear\nand convincing evidence that reunification was in the best interests of the children.\nSubsequently, the court issued a written order in which it denied the parents family\nreunification services pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) both because of their\npast resistance to court-ordered treatment and their repeated failure to participate in the\ntreatment ordered by the court in the present case.\n       The court informed the parents of their right to seek a writ petition from this court\nand of a hearing pursuant to section 366.26 scheduled for May 18, 2015. The parents\u2019\n\n       4\n          This other portion of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) states that\n\u201c[r]eunification services need not be provided to a parent . . . when the juvenile court\nfinds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent \u201chas a history of extensive,\nabusive, and chronic use of drugs . . . [and] has failed or refused to comply with a\nprogram of drug or alcohol treatment described in the case plan required by Section 358.1\non at least two prior occasions, even though the programs identified were available and\naccessible.\u201d\n\n\n                                              7\n\fwrit petitions and requests for stays followed. By order filed on March 13, 2015, this\ncourt issued an order to show cause and denied mother\u2019s and father\u2019s requests to stay the\nMay 18, 2015 hearing pending the outcome of their petitions. No responses to the\npetitions have been filed.\n                                            II.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n                             A. Father\u2019s Petition Arguments\n       Father argues we should grant his petition for two reasons, neither of which is\npersuasive.\n       1. Father Has Not Established That He Should Be Allowed to Withdraw His\n          No Contest Plea.\n\n       Father first argues that he pleaded no contest to the amended petition allegations at\nthe jurisdictional hearing because, as indicated on his waiver form, he understood that he\nwould receive family reunification services and that the court was required to provide\nthese services. Since the court did not, he should be allowed to withdraw his no contest\nplea. We conclude father has not established the court was required to provide him with\nreunification services based on his waiver form.\n       Specifically, father argues that (1) \u201c[t]he court found the parents made a knowing\nand intelligent waiver of their rights and that they understood the possible consequences\u201d\nas required by California Rules of Court, rule 5.682(e); (2) the waiver form\nunambiguously indicated that he was to be provided reunification services; (3) the\njuvenile court \u201caccepted the form thereby binding it\u201d (a proposition for which he cites no\nlegal authority); (4) we should not conclude he waived his appellate claim by not first\nraising it in the court below, citing California Rules of Court, rule 5.682(e) and Arlena M.\nv.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569; and (5) we should conclude the error\nis reversible per se pursuant to Arlena M. and remand the matter so that he can be\n\u201callowed to withdraw his plea or get the benefit of his plea and receive reunification\nservices.\u201d\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f       We do not need to address more than father\u2019s first three points. Father is correct\nthat the court found that he and mother made a knowing and intelligent waiver of their\nrights and understood the possible consequences of their waiver, but the court\u2019s findings\nwork against, rather than support, his claim. The court\u2019s written order for the\njurisdictional hearing indicates that mother and father made intelligent waivers of their\nrights after the court advised them of the possible consequences of admitting allegations\nof the petition, and mother and father stated that \u201cno threats, inducements or promises\nwere made by anyone re dispo of charges in petition.\u201d (Italics added.) This finding\nindicates that the court did not bind itself to any agreement or promise to provide\nreunification services, and that father did not reasonably rely on any such agreement or\npromise in pleading no contest.\n       Father does not address this finding, nor point to anything in the record or in law\nthat indicates the juvenile court obligated itself to provide reunification services (the\nrecord indicates only that the form was filed with the court on the same day as the\nhearing). Indeed, father has not provided a reporter\u2019s transcript of the hearing, which\npresumably would shed further light on the subject, although \u201c[o]rdinarily in writ\nproceedings the petitioner has the burden of furnishing a sufficient record.\u201d (Tex-Cal\nLand Management v.

We conclude, based\non the record before us, that father has failed to meet his burden here.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       2. Substantial Evidence Supports the Court\u2019s Denial of Family Reunification\n          Services to Father Pursuant to Section 361.5, Subdivision (b)(13).\n       Father next argues that, even if the juvenile court could deny him family\nreunification services pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13), it should have\nordered that he receive them. We disagree.\n       As we have stated, section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) allows the juvenile court to\ndeny a parent family reunification services based on, among other things, clear and\nconvincing evidence that the parent has a history of extensive, abusive and chronic use of\ndrugs and has resisted prior court-ordered treatment for such a problem during the three-\nyear period prior to the filing of the petition before the court.\n       \u201cWe affirm an order denying reunification services if the order is supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d (In re Harmony B.

He acknowledges that he was in a\ncourt-ordered drug treatment program in 2006, via the criminal court, and that this\nsatisfies the section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) requirement based on In re Brian M.\n(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

By resisting\ntreatment, the parent has demonstrated that reunification services \u201cwould be a fruitless\nattempt to protect the child because the parent\u2019s past failure to benefit from treatment\nindicates that future treatment also would fail to change the parent\u2019s destructive\nbehavior.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       The record indicates that from April 2013 to August 2014, when the Bureau filed\nits dependency petition, father was convicted of felony possession of methamphetamine,\ntested positive twice in April 2014 for methamphetamine use, and, as the court found at\nthe September 2014 jurisdiction hearing, had a \u201cpervasive substance abuse problem\nwhich impair[ed] his ability to parent\u201d in that he was using \u201cmethamphetamine and\nmarijuana.\u201d This record shows more than an isolated relapse.

Father\u2019s \u201cBest Interests\u201d Argument Lacks Merit.\n       Father also argues that, even if his substance abuse came within the parameters of\nsection 361.5, subdivision (b)(13), the court should not have denied him reunification\nservices because \u201creunification is in the best interests of the children.\u201d\nFather\u2019s argument states, but then disregards, the legal standard the juvenile court was to\napply and ignores altogether the scope of our review of the court\u2019s finding.\n       Generally, in a dependency proceeding, the children\u2019s best interests are held\nparamount.

Father does not address this portion of the juvenile court\u2019s\nruling and mother only refers to it in one sentence, when she contends there was no\nevidence that she failed to comply with a drug program on at least two prior occasions.\nWe do not address whether father and mother also violated this portion of section 361.5,\nsubdivision (b)(13) in light of our conclusions about their petition claims.\n\n\n                                               12\n\fdisposition hearing that there was not clear and convincing evidence that ordering\nreunification services was in the best interests of the children appears to have been made\nwith this provision in mind.\n       Father argues the juvenile court should have ordered reunification services\n                                                                        6\npursuant to the standard contained in section 361.5, subdivision (c), i.e., he contends\nreunification was in the best interest of the children. He contends the record indicates\nthat all of the children knew him, had a healthy attachment to him and wanted to be with\nhim; that at the October 2014 disposition hearing session he was in a residential treatment\nprogram, thereby indicating his desire and effort to reunify with his children; and that,\nalthough he was in custody at the January 2015 disposition hearing session, this was not a\nnew arrest, but because of a probation violation relating to his drug use in April 2014. He\npoints out that the Bureau recommended that he receive reunification services and that\neven minors\u2019 counsel did not argue that the children did not want to be with their parents.\n       Father\u2019s arguments ignore the substantial evidence relied on by the court and\ncontained in the record indicating there was not clear and convincing evidence that\nreunification was in the children\u2019s best interests. He leaves unaddressed the major\nconcerns that the juvenile court referred to in its ruling, such as the lack of stability in the\nchildren\u2019s lives as a result of the parents\u2019 chronic substance abuse problems, that the\nparents had failed to participate in drug treatment in the present case (father having left\nhis residential treatment program in late November 2014), the children\u2019s poor school\nattendance record, their problems getting enough to eat and the lack of attention to their\nbasic medical needs. He also ignores other facts in the record, including parents\u2019 history\nof failing to obtain medical care for the children, leading to Julian\u2019s hospitalization, the\nrepeated expulsions of the family from shelters and the injuries to three-year-old Josiah.\nFather does not explain why this evidence is insufficient to support the court\u2019s\ndetermination that there was not clear and convincing evidence that reunification was in\n\n\n       6\n         Father incorrectly states the standard is contained in section 361.5, subdivision\n(b)(13), but correctly states the standard.\n\n\n                                               13\n\fthe children\u2019s best interests. We conclude that it is sufficient based on the record before\nus.\n                             B. Mother\u2019s Petition Arguments\n       1. The Petition Allegations and Substantial Evidence Support the Juvenile\n          Court\u2019s Denial of Reunification Services to Mother.\n       Mother first argues that the sustained petition allegations are the only basis for the\ncourt\u2019s denial of family reunification services to her and legally insufficient to meet the\nrequirements of section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13). We disagree.\n       As we have discussed, the juvenile court denied mother reunification services\npursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13), which allows the court to do so based on,\namong other things, clear and convincing evidence that she had a history of extensive,\nabusive and chronic use of drugs and has resisted prior court-ordered treatment for her\nproblem during the three-year period prior to the filing of the petition before the court.\n       Mother argues that there was no finding by the court that she had a history of\nextensive, abusive, and chronic drug and alcohol use or had resisted treatment, that \u201cthe\nfailure of the petition to allege these facts precluded the court from making these findings\nand, hence, \u201cthere was insufficient evidence\u201d for the court to apply section 361.5,\nsubdivision (b)(13). Most specifically, she contends the juvenile court\u2019s sustaining of the\nallegation that she had a \u201cpervasive substance abuse problem which impairs her ability to\nparent in that . . . mother admits to using methamphetamine and marijuana\u201d is \u201clegally\ninsufficient to constitute chronic, habitual drug abuse,\u201d particularly in light of the finding\nthat she was only \u201cusing\u201d methamphetamine and marijuana.\n       Mother does not cite any legal authority for her argument and it is not persuasive.\nThe word \u201cpervade\u201d means \u201cto become diffused throughout every part of: spread\nthroughout.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (2002) p. 1688.) \u201cPervasive\u201d refers to\nsomething \u201cthat pervades or tends to pervade esp[ecially] in such a way as to be or\nbecome prevalent or dominant.\u201d (Ibid.) Given these expansive definitions, we see no\nreason why a \u201cpervasive\u201d use of methamphetamine and marijuana cannot encompass a\n\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fhistory of extensive, abusive and chronic use of drugs as required by section 361.5,\nsubdivision (b)(13).\n       Furthermore, there was other evidence before the court that mother had an\nextensive, abusive and chronic drug use history and had \u201cresisted\u201d prior court-ordered\ntreatment within the past three years prior to the filing of the petition. The Bureau, in its\ndisposition report, stated that father and mother \u201c[t]ogether . . . have had a chronic pattern\nof marijuana and methamphetamine abuse over the years.\u201d At the disposition hearing,\nthe juvenile court took judicial notice of mother\u2019s pleading guilty in 2008 to\nmisdemeanor possession of methamphetamine, and that she had completed a court-\nordered treatment program that same year. Mother testified to having completed that\nprogram and another ordered as part of a dependency case in 2007 or 2008. Mother also\ntestified that she had \u201ca drug addiction\u201d and \u201cwas unable to care for\u201d her children. She\nsaid she had been sober since August 6, 2014, thereby indicating that she was not sober\nprior to that time.\n       This evidence\u2014none of which mother contested\u2014and the court\u2019s finding that\nmother\u2019s parenting was impaired because she had a \u201cpervasive\u201d drug problem due to her\nuse of methamphetamine and marijuana, is substantial evidence of clear and convincing\nevidence satisfying the requirements of section 361, subdivision (b)(13). Furthermore,\nthe court relied on this evidence to deny mother reunification services. It referred to,\namong other things, the \u201cparents\u2019 chronic substance abuse problems\u201d and found that\nsection 361, subdivision (b)(13) applied based \u201con this history and this record.\u201d\nTherefore, mother\u2019s \u201clegally insufficient\u201d argument lacks merit.\n       Mother also argues that the juvenile court abused its discretion in denying her\nreunification services because the Bureau did not request denial and the court\u2019s order was\ninconsistent with the best interests of the children. Mother contends that she was in\nsubstantial compliance with every component of her case plan and had a strong parent-\nchild bond with her children, that reunification services would be beneficial to her\nchildren and that the Legislature in enacting the juvenile dependency statutes indicated in\nsection 300.2 that families should be preserved whenever possible.\n\n\n                                             15\n\f       Mother\u2019s arguments ignore both the substantial evidence in support of the juvenile\ncourt\u2019s denial of reunification pursuant to section 361.5, subdivision (b)(13) and the\nLegislature\u2019s purpose in enacting this exception, both of which we have already\ndiscussed. Mother does not establish that the juvenile court abused its discretion.\n       2. The Juvenile Court Did Not Improperly Shift the Burden of Proof.\n       Finally, mother argues that the juvenile court improperly shifted the burden of\nproof to her, rather than the Bureau, when the court found there was not clear and\nconvincing evidence that reunification was in the best interests of the children. She notes\nthere is a general presumption in favor of reunification services, as stated in Riverside\nCounty Dept. of Public Social Services v. Superior Court (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2262596\"><a href=\"/opinion/2262596/dpss-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.
