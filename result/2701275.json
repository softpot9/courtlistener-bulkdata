Bickerstaff appeals the August 10, 2009 decision of the\nJefferson County Court of Common Pleas, which sentenced him to thirty-six years to life\nin prison, subsequent to a jury finding of guilty for aggravated murder, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(A), and murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), with accompanying firearm\nspecifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145, and gang specifications pursuant to R.C.\n2941.142.\n       {\u00b62}    On appeal, Bickerstaff argues that he should have been given a jury\ninstruction on the inferior offense of voluntary manslaughter, and that the trial court\nerroneously admitted prejudicial hearsay evidence at trial. Bickerstaff further argues that\nthe verdicts for his gang specifications were not supported by sufficient evidence and\nwere against the manifest weight of the evidence, and finally, that his murder and\naggravated murder convictions should have been merged at sentencing.\n       {\u00b63}    Bickerstaff did not meet his burden of proving a serious provocation by the\nvictim in order to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction, and elicited the hearsay\ntestimony he now attacks, inviting the alleged error. The gang specification conviction is\nsupported by sufficient evidence, and is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nFinally, Bickerstaff committed aggravated murder and murder through the single act of\nshooting the victim, and thus the convictions should have merged at sentencing.\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the\ncase is remanded for resentencing.\n                             Facts and Procedural History\n       {\u00b64}    On March 19, 2009, Bickerstaff was indicted for aggravated murder, in\nviolation of R.C. 2903.01(A), and murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), with firearm and\ngang specifications, pursuant to R.C. 2941.145(A) and R.C. 2941.142, respectively. The\nindictment stemmed from the March 7, 2009 shooting of Darrell Longmire, in the\npresence of multiple witnesses. Bickerstaff entered a plea of not guilty, and his case\nproceeded to a jury trial on July 30, 2009.\n\f                                                                                           -3-\n\n\n       {\u00b65}   The undisputed testimony of various witnesses established that Bickerstaff\nand Longmire engaged in a brief altercation inside the convenience store at a gas station,\nduring the early evening of March 7, 2009. Among the witnesses to the altercation were\nWillette Fordham and Danielle Thompson, friends of Longmire, as well as Michelle\nMcGee, Bickerstaff's girlfriend. Witness testimony varied regarding the extent to which\nthe two men attempted to harm one another. As the two men fought, witnesses testified\nthat McGee began to yell, among other things, the phrase \"Su-Woo,\" which is commonly\nused by members of the Bloods to indicate their presence. After a store employee told all\nof the parties to leave, Longmire departed with Fordham and Thompson in Fordham's\nvan, and Bickerstaff departed with McGee in a white truck.\n       {\u00b66}   Upon leaving the gas station, Fordham drove to her house. Longmire then\nwalked to his nearby house to drop off some items, and shortly returned to Fordham's\nhouse. Longmire and a number of other people then stood around the front of Fordham's\nhouse together to socialize. A few minutes later, Bickerstaff and another man drove up to\nFordham's house in a black Lincoln and got out of the vehicle. Bickerstaff pulled out a\nfirearm and shot Longmire in the chest at close range, causing his death.\n       {\u00b67}   Steubenville Police Department Patrolman Nathan Cline testified that he\nwas dispatched to the scene shortly after the shooting occurred. Cline testified that all\neye-witnesses identified Bickerstaff as the shooter, and one witness stated repeatedly\nthat the shooting was a \"flag thing.\" Cline explained that the term \"flag\" related to the\ndifferent colors of bandannas that gang members wore or displayed in order to show their\naffiliation with a particular gang. Multiple witnesses testified that Bickerstaff was affiliated\nwith the Bloods, and that Longmire was affiliated with a rival gang, the Crips.\n       {\u00b68}   After the police apprehended and detained Bickerstaff, Detective John\nLelless took photographs of the many tattoos on Bickerstaff's body. Lelless testified that\nmany of the tattoos involved gang-related statements, and that images such as a dog and\na five-pointed star are associated with the Bloods Lelless testified that the significance of\nBickerstaff's \"740\" tattoo is that members of the Bloods \"use their area code for a specific\narea where they hail from.\" Lelless testified that Bickerstaff admitted that the various\n\f                                                                                        -4-\n\n\ntattoos on his body were gang tattoos, but claimed that he was no longer an active\nmember of the gang.\n       {\u00b69}   After the State's case in chief, Bickerstaff submitted a Crim.R. 29 motion\nregarding Bickerstaff's gang specification, arguing that the State had failed to introduce\nevidence that Bickerstaff continued to be a gang member at the time of the shooting, or\nthat the shooting was related to any gang activity. The trial court overruled Bickerstaff's\nmotion. Following Bickerstaff's case in chief, Bickerstaff requested a jury instruction for\ninvoluntary and voluntary manslaughter.           Bickerstaff argued that a voluntary\nmanslaughter instruction was warranted because \"the provocation in this matter comes\nfrom the State's allegation that this is a gang-related crime.\" The trial court denied\nBickerstaff's request.\n       {\u00b610} The jury returned verdicts of guilty for Bickerstaff's charges of murder,\naggravated murder, the specification that Bickerstaff possessed a gun during the\ncommission of his offenses, and the specification that Bickerstaff committed the offenses\nwhile participating in a criminal gang.      The trial court immediately proceeded to\nsentencing. The trial court imposed the mandatory sentence of 30 years to life for\naggravated murder, 15 years to life for murder, the mandatory sentence of three years for\nthe gun specifications, and a sentence of three years for the gang specifications. The\ntrial court determined that Bickerstaff's sentences should be run concurrently, for a total\nsentence of 36 years to life.\n                     Jury Instructions \u2013 Voluntary Manslaughter\n       {\u00b611} In his first of four assignments of error, which we will address slightly out of\norder, Bickerstaff asserts:\n       {\u00b612} \"The Trial Court Erred in Denying Mr. Bickerstaff's Request for a Jury\nInstruction as to Voluntary Manslaughter.\"\n       {\u00b613} Bickerstaff argues that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to\ninclude an instruction for voluntary manslaughter in addition to the instructions for murder\nand aggravated murder. Bickerstaff argues that he established sufficient provocation\nfrom the victim to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction.\n\f                                                                                            -5-\n\n\n       {\u00b614} An appellate court reviews a trial court's decision to give or not to give a\nparticular jury instruction under an abuse-of-discretion standard. State v. Kaufman, 187\nOhio App.3d 50, 2010-Ohio-1536, 931 N.E.2d 143, at \u00b6103. An abuse of discretion\nconnotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies an attitude on the part of the\ncourt that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Adams (1980), 62 Ohio\nSt.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.\n       {\u00b615} A jury may consider an offense that is an inferior degree of the indicted\noffense. State v. Deem (1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294, paragraph one of the\nsyllabus. \"An offense is an 'inferior degree' of the indicted offense where its elements are\nidentical to or contained within the indicted offense, except for one or more additional\nmitigating elements.\" Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Under this test, voluntary\nmanslaughter is an inferior degree of murder. State v. Shane (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 630,\n632, 590 N.E.2d 272. In order to include an instruction for the inferior degree offense of\nvoluntary manslaughter, the evidence presented at trial must \"reasonably support both an\nacquittal on the charged crime of murder and a conviction for voluntary manslaughter.\"\nId. The trial court is required to consider the facts of the case and evaluate the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the defendant. State v. Wilkins (1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 382,\n388, 415 N.E.2d 303.        Thus, a reviewing court must determine whether sufficient\nevidence was presented at trial relative to the voluntary manslaughter offense in order to\nwarrant its inclusion in the instructions to the jury. In order to be entitled to an instruction,\na defendant must show that there is more than \"some evidence\" meriting such an\ninstruction. Shane at 632.\n       {\u00b616} Aggravated murder is defined as purposely causing the death of another\nwith prior calculation and design. R.C. 2903.01(A). Felony murder is defined as causing\nthe death of another as a proximate result of the defendant's commission of a first or\nsecond degree felony of violence. R.C. 2903.02(B). In contrast, voluntary manslaughter\nis defined as knowingly causing the death of another \"while under the influence of sudden\npassion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation\noccasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly\n\f                                                                                       -6-\n\n\nforce.\" R.C. 2903.03(A).\n       {\u00b617} In order to warrant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, the defendant\nmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a provocation by the\nvictim, that the provocation was severe enough to inflame even an ordinary person into\nusing deadly force, and that the defendant was so inflamed. State v. Mack (1998), 82\nOhio St.3d 198, 201, 694 N.E.2d 1328; Shane at 634. The defendant's burden contains\nboth an objective and a subjective element.         Objectively, \"[f]or provocation to be\nreasonably sufficient, it must be sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary person\nbeyond the power of his or her control.\" Id. at 635. And to subjectively determine\nwhether the provocation by a victim was sufficient to provoke the use of deadly force in a\nparticular case, \"the court must consider the emotional and mental state of the defendant\nand the conditions and circumstances that surrounded him at the time.\" Deem, 40 Ohio\nSt.3d at 211, quoting State v. Mabry (1982), 5 Ohio App.3d 13, 5 OBR 14, 449 N.E.2d 16,\nparagraph five of the syllabus. Past incidents do not satisfy the test for reasonably\nsufficient provocation when there is sufficient time for cooling off. Mack; Shane.\n       {\u00b618} The provocation in this case is purported to be the altercation between\nBickerstaff and the victim inside the store at a gas station. According to witness\ntestimony, Bickerstaff and the victim engaged in a short argument inside the store, which\nended when a store employee told them to leave. Fordham testified that the victim\npointed his finger at Bickerstaff's face and pushed him up on a beverage machine, but no\npunches were thrown by either party. According to Danielle Thompson, the victim choked\nBickerstaff during the altercation. The surveillance camera video reflected that both\nparties had their hands on each other during the altercation. According to the trial court's\nobservations, Bickerstaff was the only party to throw a punch. However, upon viewing the\nvideo provided on appeal, it is not possible to discern whether any punches were thrown,\nthough it is clear there was a physical scuffle between Bickerstaff and the victim.\n       {\u00b619} Although there was conflicting testimony as to who made physical contact\nwith whom, all witnesses testified that the altercation was minor and short-lived. The\naltercation between the parties does not constitute serious provocation. This incident\n\f                                                                                        -7-\n\n\nwould not be sufficient to incite an ordinary person to use deadly force. See Shane at\n635. In other words, this incident could not have reasonably provoked a sudden rage or\npassion in Bickerstaff, leading him to shoot the victim.\n       {\u00b620} Moreover, there is no evidence that Bickerstaff was subjectively provoked.\nAlthough Bickerstaff did not testify at trial to explain his perception of the events leading\nup to the shooting, the testimony of other witnesses indicated that Bickerstaff remained\nrelatively calm at the time of the altercation. Fordham testified that although Bickerstaff's\ngirlfriend was extremely agitated, Bickerstaff himself was much calmer, and attempted to\ncalm his girlfriend down at the time of the altercation.\n       {\u00b621} Finally, the timing of the events in this case belies the claim that Bickerstaff\nwas subject to a \"sudden fit\" of passion or rage. After the two parties had argued at the\nconvenience store, they separated ways. Over the course of approximately 10 to 15\nminutes, Bickerstaff then procured a shotgun, changed vehicles, and located the victim.\nThere is nothing in the record to indicate that Bickerstaff was acting under provocation\nwhen he shot the victim, and it appears that Bickerstaff had enough time to \"cool down\"\nover the span of 15 minutes. Thus, the evidence fails to demonstrate the requisite\nobjective or subjective provocation to satisfy the elements of voluntary manslaughter.\n       {\u00b622} The facts of this case do not reasonably support both an acquittal on the\ncharged crimes of murder and aggravated murder, and a conviction for voluntary\nmanslaughter. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to instruct\nthe jury on the offense of voluntary manslaughter. Bickerstaff's first assignment of error is\nmeritless.\n                                             Hearsay\n       {\u00b623} In his third assignment of error, Bickerstaff asserts:\n       {\u00b624} \"The Trial Court Abused its Discretion in Admitting Hearsay as to\nParticularly Prejudicial Aspect of the State's Case.\" [sic]\n       {\u00b625} Bickerstaff argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error by allowing\nDetective Lelless to provide hearsay testimony in order to prove that the time marked on\nthe surveillance recording of the altercation at the convenience store was thirteen minutes\n\f                                                                                      -8-\n\n\nfast. Although Bickerstaff does not articulate why the timing discrepancy in the video\nprejudiced his case, he is arguing that the additional thirteen minutes undermined his\nclaim that he shot Longmire while he was under the influence of a sudden fit of rage,\nwithout sufficient time for cooling off.\n       {\u00b626} A statement other than one made by the declarant, offered to prove the\nmatter asserted, is generally inadmissible as hearsay. Evid.R. 801(C); Evid.R. 802. As\nwith other evidentiary rulings, the determination of the admissibility of potential hearsay\nstatements rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed\nabsent an abuse of that discretion and prejudice to the defendant. State v. Hand, 107\nOhio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, at \u00b692; State v. Hymore (1967), 9 Ohio\nSt.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 224 N.E.2d 126. An abuse of discretion is more than an\nerror in judgment or a mistake of law; it connotes that the court's attitude is arbitrary,\nunreasonable or unconscionable. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d at 157.\n       {\u00b627} Detective Lelless testified that he found out that the time keeper on the\ncamera system for the convenience store was 13 minutes faster than the computer\nautomated dispatch system used by the Steubenville Police Department. Bickerstaff did\nnot object to this testimony, which does not contain any hearsay statements. When the\nState moved to admit the recording of the altercation between Bickerstaff and Longmire,\nBickerstaff objected, arguing that the time lag had not been verified by any other witness,\nand that Lelless's testimony regarding the 13-minute difference was hearsay because he\nwas not an employee at the convenience store. The judge noted that one only had to\ncompare the times reflected on each system in order to determine the time difference.\nOn cross-examination, Lelless explained that he went to the convenience store\napproximately four months after the shooting, and verified that there was a time\ndifference of 13 minutes between the time reflected on the convenience store's\nsurveillance tape, and the time reflected on the Steubenville Police Department's dispatch\nsystem. On further cross-examination:\n       {\u00b628} \"Q: So there's no way of saying if the time stamp on this tape for that day\nwas correct or whether it wasn't; is there?\n\f                                                                                      -9-\n\n\n       {\u00b629} \"A: I don't quite follow you, sir.\n       {\u00b630} \"Q: Well, a week ago - - you are able to tell this Jury that a week ago those\ntimes weren't the same; correct?\n       {\u00b631} \"A: Based on my conversation with the assistant manager at Speedway I\nverified the time difference, if any, and there was 13 minutes with our dispatch. I asked\nhim has any technician or anybody fooled with the time one way or another or any\nmaintenance since March 7th of 2009 and his reply was no one has bothered our\nsurveillance cameras.\"\n       {\u00b632} Bickerstaff's only objection regarding this issue occurred when the State\nmoved to admit the recording. Because Bickerstaff did not make any objections during\nLelless's testimony, he has waived the ability to attack the admissibility of his testimony\non appeal. Moreover, Bickerstaff was the only party to elicit the hearsay testimony from\nLelless, thus inviting the error. \"A party who invites an error may not demand from the\nappellate court comfort from its consequences.\" State v. Jones (1996), 114 Ohio App.3d\n306, 322, 683 N.E.2d 87. Finally, Bickerstaff has not demonstrated any prejudice\nresulting from the hearsay statement of the convenience store employee regarding\nauthenticity issues with the surveillance tape.      Lelless testified that he personally\nobserved the 13-minute time difference, and the observations of other witnesses verified\nthat over ten minutes elapsed between Longmire's return home from the convenience\nstore and the shooting.\n       {\u00b633} Bickerstaff has failed to demonstrate any prejudicial error resulting from the\nclaimed hearsay testimony, and has otherwise waived the issue for appeal. Accordingly,\nhis third assignment of error is meritless.\n               Gang Specification \u2013 Sufficiency and Manifest Weight\n       {\u00b634} In his second assignment of error, Bickerstaff asserts:\n       {\u00b635} \"The Evidence was Insufficient to Support the Verdict as to the Gang\nSpecifications, and the Verdicts were Against the Manifest Weight of the Evidence.\"\n       {\u00b636} The issues of sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence involve\nseparate inquiries, and will be addressed in turn.\n\f                                                                                       - 10 -\n\n\n       {\u00b637} \"Sufficiency of the evidence is the standard applied to determine whether\nthe case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient as a matter of law\nto support the jury verdict.\" State v. Smith (1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 113, 684 N.E.2d\n668. Thus, sufficiency is a test of adequacy. State v. Thompkins (1997), 78 Ohio St.3d\n380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict\nis a question of law. Id. In reviewing the record for sufficiency, the relevant inquiry is\nwhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Smith at 113.\n       {\u00b638} Bickerstaff was found guilty of a gang specification, under R.C. 2941.142.\nThe gang specification statute allows a trial court to impose a mandatory prison term of\none to three years upon a defendant who commits \"a felony that is an offense of violence\nwhile participating in a criminal gang.\" R.C. 2941.142(A). The definition of a criminal\ngang is provided by R.C. 2923.41:\n       {\u00b639} \"(A) 'Criminal gang' means an ongoing formal or informal organization,\nassociation, or group of three or more persons to which all of the following apply:\n       {\u00b640} \"(1) It has as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of\nthe offenses listed in division (B) of this section.\n       {\u00b641} \"(2) It has a common name or one or more common, identifying signs,\nsymbols, or colors.\n       {\u00b642} \"(3) The persons in the organization, association, or group individually or\ncollectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\n       {\u00b643} \"(B)(1) \"Pattern of criminal gang activity\" means, subject to division (B)(2) of\nthis section, that persons in the criminal gang have committed, attempted to commit,\nconspired to commit, been complicitors in the commission of, or solicited, coerced, or\nintimidated another to commit, attempt to commit, conspire to commit, or be in complicity\nin the commission of two or more of any of the following offenses:\n       {\u00b644} \"(a) A felony or an act committed by a juvenile that would be a felony if\ncommitted by an adult;\n\f                                                                                         - 11 -\n\n\n        {\u00b645} \"(b) An offense of violence or an act committed by a juvenile that would be\nan offense of violence if committed by an adult;\n        {\u00b646} \"(c) A violation of section 2907.04, 2909.06, 2911.211 [2911.21.1], 2917.04,\n2919.23, or 2919.24 of the Revised Code, section 2921.04 or 2923.16 of the Revised\nCode, section 2925.03 of the Revised Code if the offense is trafficking in marihuana, or\nsection 2927.12 of the Revised Code.\n        {\u00b647} \"(2) There is a \"pattern of criminal gang activity\" if all of the following apply\nwith respect to the offenses that are listed in division (B)(1)(a), (b), or (c) of this section\nand that persons in the criminal gang committed, attempted to commit, conspired to\ncommit, were in complicity in committing, or solicited, coerced, or intimidated another to\ncommit, attempt to commit, conspire to commit, or be in complicity in committing:\n        {\u00b648} \"(a) At least one of the two or more offenses is a felony.\n        {\u00b649} \"(b) At least one of those two or more offenses occurs on or after January 1,\n1999.\n        {\u00b650} \"(c) The last of those two or more offenses occurs within five years after at\nleast one of those offenses.\n        {\u00b651} \"(d) The two or more offenses are committed on separate occasions or by\ntwo or more persons.\"\n        {\u00b652} Bickerstaff argues that the State did not prove all elements of the criminal\ngang specification, because the State did not present evidence that Bickerstaff continued\nto be a member of the Bloods at the time of the shooting, or that the shooting was related\nto gang activity instead of a personal vendetta. Bickerstaff also argues that the State\nestablished that a gang called the Bloods existed, but failed to prove that there was a\nspecific gang identified as the Bloods in the Steubenville area. Finally, Bickerstaff argues\nthat witness testimony did not describe the \"pattern of criminal gang activity\" committed\nby the Bloods with adequate specificity to satisfy R.C. 2923.41(B).\n        {\u00b653} As for Bickerstaff's affiliation with the Bloods, Bickerstaff admitted that he\nwas a member of the Bloods at some point in his life, but had ceased to be an active\nmember at some point prior to the shooting. Detective Lelless testified that Bickerstaff\n\f                                                                                      - 12 -\n\n\nadmitted that the various tattoos on his body were gang tattoos, but claimed that he was\nno longer an active member of the gang. The State presented evidence that immediately\nafter the shooting, a witness at the scene told the police that the shooting was \"a flag\nthing.\" Multiple witnesses explained that the term \"flag\" related to the different colors of\nbandannas that gang members wore or displayed in order to show their affiliation with a\nparticular gang. Multiple witnesses testified that Bickerstaff's girlfriend began to make\ngang-related exclamations when Bickerstaff and Longmire began to fight at the\nconvenience store.     But there was no testimony that Bickerstaff made any such\nstatements.\n       {\u00b654} Willette Fordham testified that she herself had been a member of the\nBloods in Steubenville for approximately 18 years. Fordham also testified that she had\nknown Bickerstaff since he was young, and that she knew Bickerstaff to be a member of\nthe Bloods. Maleah Fletcher testified that she knew Bickerstaff to be a member of a\ncriminal gang. Kenneth Salters testified that Bickerstaff had confided in him during his\nincarceration, and told Salters that he was a Blood, that Longmire was a Crip, and that\ntheir altercation arose out of something gang-related. Given the foregoing testimony, the\nState presented evidence that Bickerstaff continued to be a member of the Bloods at the\ntime of the offense, and that the offense was motivated by or related to Bickerstaff's\nparticipation in the Bloods.\n       {\u00b655} As for the existence of the Bloods in the local Steubenville area, one of\nBickerstaff's witnesses, Boycan, testified that there were approximately 20 to 25 people\naffiliated with the Bloods in the local Steubenville area. Fordham testified that she and\nBickerstaff lived in Steubenville, that she had been a member of the Bloods in\nSteubenville, and that Bickerstaff was a member as well. Detective Lelless testified that\nthe Bloods are active locally in the Steubenville area.\n       {\u00b656} As a final issue, Bickerstaff argues that the State failed to provide evidence\nthat the Bloods engaged in a \"pattern of criminal gang activity,\" in satisfaction of the\nelements in R.C. 2923.41(B)(2). Bickerstaff contends that the facts of his case are similar\nto those of In re R.G., 8th Dist. No. 90389, 2008-Ohio-6469, wherein the Eighth District\n\f                                                                                        - 13 -\n\n\nreversed a juvenile's gang specification because the State had failed to demonstrate that\nthe alleged gang in question \"engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\" Id. at \u00b676.\nThe Eighth District noted that the State had only established R.G.'s participation in a gang\ncalled the Harvard Boys, and that one of the gang's primary activity was the sale of\nmarijuana, but did not provide any evidence that members of the gang \"committed two or\nmore of the offenses listed in R.C. 2923.41(B)(1) or that any such crimes met the\nadditional criteria set forth in R.C. 2923.41(B)(2).\" Id. The Eighth District relied on State\nv. Johnson, 10th Dist. No. 07AP-538, 2008-Ohio-590, which held that the State failed to\nprove that the defendant's gang had \"engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity\" when\nit only presented expert testimony that gangs generally commit various crimes, but no\ntestimony indicating that members of the defendant's gang had committed any specific\ncrimes. Johnson at \u00b639.\n       {\u00b657} Here, although the State did not present specific evidence about the history\nand dates of activities of the Bloods in the Steubenville area, the State's evidence was\nmore substantial than the evidence presented in In re R.G. and Johnson.\n       {\u00b658} The State relied primarily on the testimony of Detective Lelless to establish\nthe status of the Bloods as a criminal gang. Detective Lelless testified that he had been a\npolice officer for nineteen years, that he had been a law enforcement corrections\ninstructor for sixteen years, and that he trains police officers on gang recognition. Lelless\ntestified that the Bloods operate in Steubenville, and that their primary purpose is to profit\nfrom illegal activities, namely the manufacture and distribution of drugs. Lelless testified\nthat the Bloods are also known for committing crimes of violence. Lelless stated that\nvarious members of the Bloods have committed crimes such as \"[m]urders, felonious\nassaults, extortion, robbery, [and] retail theft.\" Although Lelless did not specify the dates\nupon which these various crimes occurred, his discussion of the crimes indicates that\nthey had been ongoing.\n       {\u00b659} Multiple witnesses who were self-identified members of the Bloods testified\nthat they committed a variety of crimes while they were active members of the Bloods.\nBoycan testified that he was imprisoned in Missouri in 1995 for the sale, possession and\n\f                                                                                      - 14 -\n\n\ntrafficking of narcotics, and was imprisoned again in Ohio in 2002 for committing felonious\nassault. Fordham testified that she had been released from prison in June of 2008, after\nhaving served seven years in prison for aggravated arson, which therefore would have\nbeen committed around 2001. Fordham did not say whether her offense was related to\nher affiliation with the Bloods, and Boycan denied that his crimes were gang-related.\n       {\u00b660} The foregoing testimony establishes that the Bloods had multiple members\nwho committed multiple felony offenses and offenses enumerated in R.C.\n2923.41(B)(1)(c).   Although specific dates and timelines were not established, the\ntestimony of the witnesses provides circumstantial evidence from which the trier of fact\ncould infer that at least one of the member's offenses occurred on or after January 1,\n1999, and that the most recent two offenses were within five years of one another. Thus,\nthe State provided sufficient evidence to establish the \"pattern of criminal gang activity\"\nelement.\n       {\u00b661} Bickerstaff's gang specifications were supported by legally sufficient\nevidence. Accordingly, this first portion of Bickerstaff's second assignment of error is\nmeritless.\n       {\u00b662} In the second portion of this assignment of error, Bickerstaff asserts that his\ngang specification verdicts were against the manifest weight of the evidence. In contrast\nto the sufficiency inquiry, when reviewing a judgment under a criminal manifest weight\nstandard of review, \"[t]he court reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all\nreasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a\nmanifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial\nordered.\" State v. Thompkins (1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting\nState v. Martin (1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.\n       {\u00b663} This court's discretionary power to reverse on manifest weight grounds and\ngrant a new trial is exercised only in the exceptional case where the evidence weighs\nheavily against conviction. Thompkins at 387. This standard is a high one because the\ntrier of fact was in a better position to determine credibility issues, by having personally\n\f                                                                                       - 15 -\n\n\nviewed the demeanor, voice inflections and gestures of the witnesses. State v. Ali, 154\nOhio App.3d 493, 2003-Ohio-5150, 797 N.E.2d 1019, at \u00b636; State v. DeHass (1967), 10\nOhio St.2d 230, 231, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212. A reviewing court therefore should\nnot interfere with the witness credibility and factual determinations of the jury, unless the\nrecord demonstrates that a reasonable juror simply could not have found the witness to\nbe credible. State v. Mock, 187 Ohio App. 3d 599, 2010-Ohio-2747, 933 N.E.2d 270, at\n\u00b640.\n       {\u00b664} Bickerstaff's main argument regarding the weight of the evidence is that the\nevidence supporting the gang specification was \"scant.\" Specifically, Bickerstaff argues\nthat the manifest weight of the evidence indicated that the violence between Bickerstaff\nand Longmire was purely motivated by personal differences, not gang activity. However,\nwe conclude that the jury could have reasonably found from the evidence, as discussed\nabove, that Bickerstaff was guilty of committing a felony offense of violence while\nparticipating in a criminal gang. Bickerstaff offers no reason as to why any of the\ndamaging witness testimony lacked credibility.\n       {\u00b665} Reasonable minds could differ as to whether Bickerstaff's offense was\nmotivated by gang activity or mere personal differences. Officer Cline testified that either\nMaleah Fletcher or Danielle Thompson stated repeatedly right after the shooting that it\nwas gang-related. Maleah Fletcher testified that she knew from her conversations with\nLongmire that he and Bickerstaff were involved in gang activity, and that there was a\nhistory of problems between the two men, but not \"big problems.\" Danielle Thompson\ntestified that at the time of the altercation between Bickerstaff and Longmire at the\nconvenience store, Bickerstaff's girlfriend yelled things about \"gangs, Bloods, Crips.\"\nHowever, Thompson stated that she was not aware of any gang-related problems\nbetween the two men. Willette Fordham testified that Longmire approached Bickerstaff at\nthe convenience store to address some sort of problem between the two of them, but\nFordham did not know what that problem was. Fordham also testified about Bickerstaff's\ngirlfriend's gang-related statements at the time of the altercation.\n       {\u00b666} Considering this testimony, the gang specification is not against the\n\f                                                                                        - 16 -\n\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Although some of the testimony indicated the incident\nwas borne out of personal animosity, there was other testimony that it was gang-related.\nWhen faced with conflicting testimony, neither of which is unbelievable, it is not our\nprovince to substitute our judgment for that of the jury. See State v. Dyke, 7th Dist. No.\n99 CA 149, 2002-Ohio-1152, at \u00b613, citing State v. Gore (1999), 131 Ohio App.3d 197,\n201, 722 N.E.2d 125. In convicting Bickerstaff of the gang specification, the jury did not\nclearly lose its way so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the\nsecond part of Bickerstaff's second assignment of error is also meritless.\n                                          Merger\n       {\u00b667} In his fourth and final assignment of error, Bickerstaff asserts:\n       {\u00b668} \"The Trial Court Plainly Erred in Failing to Merge the Aggravated Murder\nand Murder Convictions and by Imposing Concurrent Sentences for those Convictions.\"\n       {\u00b669} Bickerstaff argues that the trial court committed plain error in failing to\nmerge Bickerstaff's murder and aggravated murder convictions, because Bickerstaff\ncommitted one act of firing a single shot, killing one victim. The State concedes that the\ntrial court committed plain error, and that the case should be remanded for Bickerstaff to\nbe resentenced subsequent to a merger of the two convictions.\n       {\u00b670} Bickerstaff was convicted on one count of aggravated murder, in violation of\nR.C. 2903.01(A), which provides that \"[n]o person shall purposely, and with prior\ncalculation and design, cause the death of another or the unlawful termination of\nanother's pregnancy.\" Bickerstaff was convicted on one count of murder, in violation of\nR.C. 2903.02(B), which provides, \"[n]o person shall cause the death of another as a\nproximate result of the offender's committing or attempting to commit an offense of\nviolence that is a felony of the first or second degree and that is not a violation of section\n2903.03 or 2903.04 of the Revised Code.\"\n       {\u00b671} The question of whether the two convictions should merge is governed by\nR.C. 2941.25, which provides:\n       {\u00b672} \"(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute\ntwo or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain\n\f                                                                                          - 17 -\n\n\ncounts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\n       {\u00b673} \"(B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more offenses of\ndissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or\nsimilar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or\ninformation may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be\nconvicted of all of them.\"\n       {\u00b674} The Ohio Supreme Court has recently revisited the issue of merger in State\nv. Johnson, --- Ohio St.3d ---, 2010-Ohio-6314, --- N.E.2d ---, wherein the Court reversed\nthe court of appeals' decision that the crimes of felony murder and child endangering did\nnot merge. The Court was unanimous in its judgment and the syllabus language: \"When\ndetermining whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar import subject to merger\nunder R.C. 2941.25, the conduct of the accused must be considered. (State v. Rance\n(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699, overruled.)\".\n       {\u00b675} Unfortunately, with respect to the analysis to apply, there were two plurality\nopinions (Brown, Pfeifer, Stratton) and (O'Connor, Lanzinger, Cupp), as well as a third\nminority opinion (O'Donnell, Stratton). Thus, there is no controlling case law to guide the\ncourts of appeals in the application of the syllabus law. See Kraly v. Vannewkirk (1994),\n69 Ohio St.3d 627, 633, 635 N.E.2d 323 (characterizing prior case as \"of questionable\nprecedential value inasmuch as it was a plurality opinion which failed to receive the\nrequisite support of four justices of this court in order to constitute controlling law\"). Thus,\nwe are left with the statutory language, along with the Supreme Court's mandate that the\naccused's conduct must be considered and that courts should no longer compare the\nelements of offenses solely in the abstract.         Johnson at \u00b644; \u00b668 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment); \u00b672-73 (O'Donnell, J., separately concurring).\n       {\u00b676} The record reflects that Bickerstaff committed the offenses of aggravated\nmurder and murder through the single act of shooting Longmire, and with the single state\nof mind. The trial court therefore committed plain error by failing to merge Bickerstaff's\nconvictions for murder and aggravated murder. The State \"retains the right to elect which\nallied offense to pursue on sentencing on a remand to the trial court after an appeal.\"\n\f                                                                                    - 18 -\n\n\nState v. Whitfield, 124 Ohio St.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-2, 922 N.E.2d 182, at \u00b621. This court\nmust therefore remand the issue to the trial court for a de novo sentencing hearing during\nwhich the State may elect to pursue either Bickerstaff's murder or aggravated murder\nconviction, along with their corresponding firearm and gang specifications, for sentencing\npurposes. Accordingly, Bickerstaff's fourth assignment of error is meritorious.\n       {\u00b677} In conclusion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to\nprovide a voluntary manslaughter instruction to the jury, Bickerstaff has not demonstrated\nany prejudice regarding the alleged hearsay statement, and has otherwise waived the\nissue on appeal. Bickerstaff's gang specification conviction is supported by legally\nsufficient evidence, and is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Finally,\nBickerstaff's aggravated murder and murder convictions should have been merged at\nsentencing. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part, reversed in\npart, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for resentencing.\nDonofrio, J., concurs.\nVukovich, J., concurs.\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">[Cite as State v.

Bickerstaff appeals the August 10, 2009 decision of the\nJefferson County Court of Common Pleas, which sentenced him to thirty-six years to life\nin prison, subsequent to a jury finding of guilty for aggravated murder, in violation of R.C.\n2903.01(A), and murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), with accompanying firearm\nspecifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145, and gang specifications pursuant to R.C.\n2941.142.\n       {\u00b62}    On appeal, Bickerstaff argues that he should have been given a jury\ninstruction on the inferior offense of voluntary manslaughter, and that the trial court\nerroneously admitted prejudicial hearsay evidence at trial. Bickerstaff further argues that\nthe verdicts for his gang specifications were not supported by sufficient evidence and\nwere against the manifest weight of the evidence, and finally, that his murder and\naggravated murder convictions should have been merged at sentencing.\n       {\u00b63}    Bickerstaff did not meet his burden of proving a serious provocation by the\nvictim in order to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction, and elicited the hearsay\ntestimony he now attacks, inviting the alleged error. The gang specification conviction is\nsupported by sufficient evidence, and is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nFinally, Bickerstaff committed aggravated murder and murder through the single act of\nshooting the victim, and thus the convictions should have merged at sentencing.\nAccordingly, the decision of the trial court is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the\ncase is remanded for resentencing.\n                             Facts and Procedural History\n       {\u00b64}    On March 19, 2009, Bickerstaff was indicted for aggravated murder, in\nviolation of R.C. 2903.01(A), and murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), with firearm and\ngang specifications, pursuant to R.C. 2941.145(A) and R.C. 2941.142, respectively. The\nindictment stemmed from the March 7, 2009 shooting of Darrell Longmire, in the\npresence of multiple witnesses. Bickerstaff entered a plea of not guilty, and his case\nproceeded to a jury trial on July 30, 2009.\n\f                                                                                           -3-\n\n\n       {\u00b65}   The undisputed testimony of various witnesses established that Bickerstaff\nand Longmire engaged in a brief altercation inside the convenience store at a gas station,\nduring the early evening of March 7, 2009. Among the witnesses to the altercation were\nWillette Fordham and Danielle Thompson, friends of Longmire, as well as Michelle\nMcGee, Bickerstaff's girlfriend. Witness testimony varied regarding the extent to which\nthe two men attempted to harm one another. As the two men fought, witnesses testified\nthat McGee began to yell, among other things, the phrase \"Su-Woo,\" which is commonly\nused by members of the Bloods to indicate their presence. After a store employee told all\nof the parties to leave, Longmire departed with Fordham and Thompson in Fordham's\nvan, and Bickerstaff departed with McGee in a white truck.\n       {\u00b66}   Upon leaving the gas station, Fordham drove to her house. Longmire then\nwalked to his nearby house to drop off some items, and shortly returned to Fordham's\nhouse. Longmire and a number of other people then stood around the front of Fordham's\nhouse together to socialize. A few minutes later, Bickerstaff and another man drove up to\nFordham's house in a black Lincoln and got out of the vehicle. Bickerstaff pulled out a\nfirearm and shot Longmire in the chest at close range, causing his death.\n       {\u00b67}   Steubenville Police Department Patrolman Nathan Cline testified that he\nwas dispatched to the scene shortly after the shooting occurred. Cline testified that all\neye-witnesses identified Bickerstaff as the shooter, and one witness stated repeatedly\nthat the shooting was a \"flag thing.\" Cline explained that the term \"flag\" related to the\ndifferent colors of bandannas that gang members wore or displayed in order to show their\naffiliation with a particular gang. Multiple witnesses testified that Bickerstaff was affiliated\nwith the Bloods, and that Longmire was affiliated with a rival gang, the Crips.\n       {\u00b68}   After the police apprehended and detained Bickerstaff, Detective John\nLelless took photographs of the many tattoos on Bickerstaff's body. Lelless testified that\nmany of the tattoos involved gang-related statements, and that images such as a dog and\na five-pointed star are associated with the Bloods Lelless testified that the significance of\nBickerstaff's \"740\" tattoo is that members of the Bloods \"use their area code for a specific\narea where they hail from.\" Lelless testified that Bickerstaff admitted that the various\n\f                                                                                        -4-\n\n\ntattoos on his body were gang tattoos, but claimed that he was no longer an active\nmember of the gang.\n       {\u00b69}   After the State's case in chief, Bickerstaff submitted a Crim.R. 29 motion\nregarding Bickerstaff's gang specification, arguing that the State had failed to introduce\nevidence that Bickerstaff continued to be a gang member at the time of the shooting, or\nthat the shooting was related to any gang activity. The trial court overruled Bickerstaff's\nmotion. Following Bickerstaff's case in chief, Bickerstaff requested a jury instruction for\ninvoluntary and voluntary manslaughter.           Bickerstaff argued that a voluntary\nmanslaughter instruction was warranted because \"the provocation in this matter comes\nfrom the State's allegation that this is a gang-related crime.\" The trial court denied\nBickerstaff's request.\n       {\u00b610} The jury returned verdicts of guilty for Bickerstaff's charges of murder,\naggravated murder, the specification that Bickerstaff possessed a gun during the\ncommission of his offenses, and the specification that Bickerstaff committed the offenses\nwhile participating in a criminal gang.      The trial court immediately proceeded to\nsentencing. The trial court imposed the mandatory sentence of 30 years to life for\naggravated murder, 15 years to life for murder, the mandatory sentence of three years for\nthe gun specifications, and a sentence of three years for the gang specifications. The\ntrial court determined that Bickerstaff's sentences should be run concurrently, for a total\nsentence of 36 years to life.\n                     Jury Instructions \u2013 Voluntary Manslaughter\n       {\u00b611} In his first of four assignments of error, which we will address slightly out of\norder, Bickerstaff asserts:\n       {\u00b612} \"The Trial Court Erred in Denying Mr. Bickerstaff's Request for a Jury\nInstruction as to Voluntary Manslaughter.\"\n       {\u00b613} Bickerstaff argues that the trial court abused its discretion in declining to\ninclude an instruction for voluntary manslaughter in addition to the instructions for murder\nand aggravated murder. Bickerstaff argues that he established sufficient provocation\nfrom the victim to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction.\n\f                                                                                            -5-\n\n\n       {\u00b614} An appellate court reviews a trial court's decision to give or not to give a\nparticular jury instruction under an abuse-of-discretion standard.

Thus, a reviewing court must determine whether sufficient\nevidence was presented at trial relative to the voluntary manslaughter offense in order to\nwarrant its inclusion in the instructions to the jury. In order to be entitled to an instruction,\na defendant must show that there is more than \"some evidence\" meriting such an\ninstruction.

Past incidents do not satisfy the test for reasonably\nsufficient provocation when there is sufficient time for cooling off. Mack; Shane.\n       {\u00b618} The provocation in this case is purported to be the altercation between\nBickerstaff and the victim inside the store at a gas station. According to witness\ntestimony, Bickerstaff and the victim engaged in a short argument inside the store, which\nended when a store employee told them to leave. Fordham testified that the victim\npointed his finger at Bickerstaff's face and pushed him up on a beverage machine, but no\npunches were thrown by either party. According to Danielle Thompson, the victim choked\nBickerstaff during the altercation. The surveillance camera video reflected that both\nparties had their hands on each other during the altercation. According to the trial court's\nobservations, Bickerstaff was the only party to throw a punch. However, upon viewing the\nvideo provided on appeal, it is not possible to discern whether any punches were thrown,\nthough it is clear there was a physical scuffle between Bickerstaff and the victim.\n       {\u00b619} Although there was conflicting testimony as to who made physical contact\nwith whom, all witnesses testified that the altercation was minor and short-lived. The\naltercation between the parties does not constitute serious provocation. This incident\n\f                                                                                        -7-\n\n\nwould not be sufficient to incite an ordinary person to use deadly force.

In other words, this incident could not have reasonably provoked a sudden rage or\npassion in Bickerstaff, leading him to shoot the victim.\n       {\u00b620} Moreover, there is no evidence that Bickerstaff was subjectively provoked.\nAlthough Bickerstaff did not testify at trial to explain his perception of the events leading\nup to the shooting, the testimony of other witnesses indicated that Bickerstaff remained\nrelatively calm at the time of the altercation. Fordham testified that although Bickerstaff's\ngirlfriend was extremely agitated, Bickerstaff himself was much calmer, and attempted to\ncalm his girlfriend down at the time of the altercation.\n       {\u00b621} Finally, the timing of the events in this case belies the claim that Bickerstaff\nwas subject to a \"sudden fit\" of passion or rage. After the two parties had argued at the\nconvenience store, they separated ways. Over the course of approximately 10 to 15\nminutes, Bickerstaff then procured a shotgun, changed vehicles, and located the victim.\nThere is nothing in the record to indicate that Bickerstaff was acting under provocation\nwhen he shot the victim, and it appears that Bickerstaff had enough time to \"cool down\"\nover the span of 15 minutes. Thus, the evidence fails to demonstrate the requisite\nobjective or subjective provocation to satisfy the elements of voluntary manslaughter.\n       {\u00b622} The facts of this case do not reasonably support both an acquittal on the\ncharged crimes of murder and aggravated murder, and a conviction for voluntary\nmanslaughter. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to instruct\nthe jury on the offense of voluntary manslaughter. Bickerstaff's first assignment of error is\nmeritless.\n                                             Hearsay\n       {\u00b623} In his third assignment of error, Bickerstaff asserts:\n       {\u00b624} \"The Trial Court Abused its Discretion in Admitting Hearsay as to\nParticularly Prejudicial Aspect of the State's Case.\" [sic]\n       {\u00b625} Bickerstaff argues that the trial court committed prejudicial error by allowing\nDetective Lelless to provide hearsay testimony in order to prove that the time marked on\nthe surveillance recording of the altercation at the convenience store was thirteen minutes\n\f                                                                                      -8-\n\n\nfast. Although Bickerstaff does not articulate why the timing discrepancy in the video\nprejudiced his case, he is arguing that the additional thirteen minutes undermined his\nclaim that he shot Longmire while he was under the influence of a sudden fit of rage,\nwithout sufficient time for cooling off.\n       {\u00b626} A statement other than one made by the declarant, offered to prove the\nmatter asserted, is generally inadmissible as hearsay. Evid.R. 801(C); Evid.R. 802. As\nwith other evidentiary rulings, the determination of the admissibility of potential hearsay\nstatements rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed\nabsent an abuse of that discretion and prejudice to the defendant.

An abuse of discretion is more than an\nerror in judgment or a mistake of law; it connotes that the court's attitude is arbitrary,\nunreasonable or unconscionable. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d at 157.\n       {\u00b627} Detective Lelless testified that he found out that the time keeper on the\ncamera system for the convenience store was 13 minutes faster than the computer\nautomated dispatch system used by the Steubenville Police Department. Bickerstaff did\nnot object to this testimony, which does not contain any hearsay statements. When the\nState moved to admit the recording of the altercation between Bickerstaff and Longmire,\nBickerstaff objected, arguing that the time lag had not been verified by any other witness,\nand that Lelless's testimony regarding the 13-minute difference was hearsay because he\nwas not an employee at the convenience store. The judge noted that one only had to\ncompare the times reflected on each system in order to determine the time difference.\nOn cross-examination, Lelless explained that he went to the convenience store\napproximately four months after the shooting, and verified that there was a time\ndifference of 13 minutes between the time reflected on the convenience store's\nsurveillance tape, and the time reflected on the Steubenville Police Department's dispatch\nsystem. On further cross-examination:\n       {\u00b628} \"Q: So there's no way of saying if the time stamp on this tape for that day\nwas correct or whether it wasn't; is there?\n\f                                                                                      -9-\n\n\n       {\u00b629} \"A: I don't quite follow you, sir.\n       {\u00b630} \"Q: Well, a week ago - - you are able to tell this Jury that a week ago those\ntimes weren't the same; correct?\n       {\u00b631} \"A: Based on my conversation with the assistant manager at Speedway I\nverified the time difference, if any, and there was 13 minutes with our dispatch.

Because Bickerstaff did not make any objections during\nLelless's testimony, he has waived the ability to attack the admissibility of his testimony\non appeal. Moreover, Bickerstaff was the only party to elicit the hearsay testimony from\nLelless, thus inviting the error. \"A party who invites an error may not demand from the\nappellate court comfort from its consequences.\" State v.

Finally, Bickerstaff has not demonstrated any prejudice\nresulting from the hearsay statement of the convenience store employee regarding\nauthenticity issues with the surveillance tape.      Lelless testified that he personally\nobserved the 13-minute time difference, and the observations of other witnesses verified\nthat over ten minutes elapsed between Longmire's return home from the convenience\nstore and the shooting.\n       {\u00b633} Bickerstaff has failed to demonstrate any prejudicial error resulting from the\nclaimed hearsay testimony, and has otherwise waived the issue for appeal. Accordingly,\nhis third assignment of error is meritless.\n               Gang Specification \u2013 Sufficiency and Manifest Weight\n       {\u00b634} In his second assignment of error, Bickerstaff asserts:\n       {\u00b635} \"The Evidence was Insufficient to Support the Verdict as to the Gang\nSpecifications, and the Verdicts were Against the Manifest Weight of the Evidence.\"\n       {\u00b636} The issues of sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence involve\nseparate inquiries, and will be addressed in turn.\n\f                                                                                       - 10 -\n\n\n       {\u00b637} \"Sufficiency of the evidence is the standard applied to determine whether\nthe case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient as a matter of law\nto support the jury verdict.\" State v.

Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict\nis a question of law. Id. In reviewing the record for sufficiency, the relevant inquiry is\nwhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any\nrational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Smith at 113.\n       {\u00b638} Bickerstaff was found guilty of a gang specification, under R.C. 2941.142.\nThe gang specification statute allows a trial court to impose a mandatory prison term of\none to three years upon a defendant who commits \"a felony that is an offense of violence\nwhile participating in a criminal gang.\" R.C. 2941.142(A). The definition of a criminal\ngang is provided by R.C. 2923.41:\n       {\u00b639} \"(A) 'Criminal gang' means an ongoing formal or informal organization,\nassociation, or group of three or more persons to which all of the following apply:\n       {\u00b640} \"(1) It has as one of its primary activities the commission of one or more of\nthe offenses listed in division (B) of this section.\n       {\u00b641} \"(2) It has a common name or one or more common, identifying signs,\nsymbols, or colors.\n       {\u00b642} \"(3) The persons in the organization, association, or group individually or\ncollectively engage in or have engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\n       {\u00b643} \"(B)(1) \"Pattern of criminal gang activity\" means, subject to division (B)(2) of\nthis section, that persons in the criminal gang have committed, attempted to commit,\nconspired to commit, been complicitors in the commission of, or solicited, coerced, or\nintimidated another to commit, attempt to commit, conspire to commit, or be in complicity\nin the commission of two or more of any of the following offenses:\n       {\u00b644} \"(a) A felony or an act committed by a juvenile that would be a felony if\ncommitted by an adult;\n\f                                                                                         - 11 -\n\n\n        {\u00b645} \"(b) An offense of violence or an act committed by a juvenile that would be\nan offense of violence if committed by an adult;\n        {\u00b646} \"(c) A violation of section 2907.04, 2909.06, 2911.211 [2911.21.1], 2917.04,\n2919.23, or 2919.24 of the Revised Code, section 2921.04 or 2923.16 of the Revised\nCode, section 2925.03 of the Revised Code if the offense is trafficking in marihuana, or\nsection 2927.12 of the Revised Code.\n        {\u00b647} \"(2) There is a \"pattern of criminal gang activity\" if all of the following apply\nwith respect to the offenses that are listed in division (B)(1)(a), (b), or (c) of this section\nand that persons in the criminal gang committed, attempted to commit, conspired to\ncommit, were in complicity in committing, or solicited, coerced, or intimidated another to\ncommit, attempt to commit, conspire to commit, or be in complicity in committing:\n        {\u00b648} \"(a) At least one of the two or more offenses is a felony.\n        {\u00b649} \"(b) At least one of those two or more offenses occurs on or after January 1,\n1999.\n        {\u00b650} \"(c) The last of those two or more offenses occurs within five years after at\nleast one of those offenses.\n        {\u00b651} \"(d) The two or more offenses are committed on separate occasions or by\ntwo or more persons.\"\n        {\u00b652} Bickerstaff argues that the State did not prove all elements of the criminal\ngang specification, because the State did not present evidence that Bickerstaff continued\nto be a member of the Bloods at the time of the shooting, or that the shooting was related\nto gang activity instead of a personal vendetta. Bickerstaff also argues that the State\nestablished that a gang called the Bloods existed, but failed to prove that there was a\nspecific gang identified as the Bloods in the Steubenville area. Finally, Bickerstaff argues\nthat witness testimony did not describe the \"pattern of criminal gang activity\" committed\nby the Bloods with adequate specificity to satisfy R.C. 2923.41(B).\n        {\u00b653} As for Bickerstaff's affiliation with the Bloods, Bickerstaff admitted that he\nwas a member of the Bloods at some point in his life, but had ceased to be an active\nmember at some point prior to the shooting. Detective Lelless testified that Bickerstaff\n\f                                                                                      - 12 -\n\n\nadmitted that the various tattoos on his body were gang tattoos, but claimed that he was\nno longer an active member of the gang. The State presented evidence that immediately\nafter the shooting, a witness at the scene told the police that the shooting was \"a flag\nthing.\" Multiple witnesses explained that the term \"flag\" related to the different colors of\nbandannas that gang members wore or displayed in order to show their affiliation with a\nparticular gang. Multiple witnesses testified that Bickerstaff's girlfriend began to make\ngang-related exclamations when Bickerstaff and Longmire began to fight at the\nconvenience store.     But there was no testimony that Bickerstaff made any such\nstatements.\n       {\u00b654} Willette Fordham testified that she herself had been a member of the\nBloods in Steubenville for approximately 18 years. Fordham also testified that she had\nknown Bickerstaff since he was young, and that she knew Bickerstaff to be a member of\nthe Bloods. Maleah Fletcher testified that she knew Bickerstaff to be a member of a\ncriminal gang. Kenneth Salters testified that Bickerstaff had confided in him during his\nincarceration, and told Salters that he was a Blood, that Longmire was a Crip, and that\ntheir altercation arose out of something gang-related. Given the foregoing testimony, the\nState presented evidence that Bickerstaff continued to be a member of the Bloods at the\ntime of the offense, and that the offense was motivated by or related to Bickerstaff's\nparticipation in the Bloods.\n       {\u00b655} As for the existence of the Bloods in the local Steubenville area, one of\nBickerstaff's witnesses, Boycan, testified that there were approximately 20 to 25 people\naffiliated with the Bloods in the local Steubenville area. Fordham testified that she and\nBickerstaff lived in Steubenville, that she had been a member of the Bloods in\nSteubenville, and that Bickerstaff was a member as well. Detective Lelless testified that\nthe Bloods are active locally in the Steubenville area.\n       {\u00b656} As a final issue, Bickerstaff argues that the State failed to provide evidence\nthat the Bloods engaged in a \"pattern of criminal gang activity,\" in satisfaction of the\nelements in R.C. 2923.41(B)(2). Bickerstaff contends that the facts of his case are similar\nto those of In re R.G., 8th Dist. No. 90389, 2008-Ohio-6469, wherein the Eighth District\n\f                                                                                        - 13 -\n\n\nreversed a juvenile's gang specification because the State had failed to demonstrate that\nthe alleged gang in question \"engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity.\" Id. at \u00b676.\nThe Eighth District noted that the State had only established R.G.'s participation in a gang\ncalled the Harvard Boys, and that one of the gang's primary activity was the sale of\nmarijuana, but did not provide any evidence that members of the gang \"committed two or\nmore of the offenses listed in R.C. 2923.41(B)(1) or that any such crimes met the\nadditional criteria set forth in R.C. 2923.41(B)(2).\" Id. The Eighth District relied on State\nv. Johnson, 10th Dist. No. 07AP-538, 2008-Ohio-590, which held that the State failed to\nprove that the defendant's gang had \"engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity\" when\nit only presented expert testimony that gangs generally commit various crimes, but no\ntestimony indicating that members of the defendant's gang had committed any specific\ncrimes. Johnson at \u00b639.\n       {\u00b657} Here, although the State did not present specific evidence about the history\nand dates of activities of the Bloods in the Steubenville area, the State's evidence was\nmore substantial than the evidence presented in In re R.G. and Johnson.\n       {\u00b658} The State relied primarily on the testimony of Detective Lelless to establish\nthe status of the Bloods as a criminal gang. Detective Lelless testified that he had been a\npolice officer for nineteen years, that he had been a law enforcement corrections\ninstructor for sixteen years, and that he trains police officers on gang recognition. Lelless\ntestified that the Bloods operate in Steubenville, and that their primary purpose is to profit\nfrom illegal activities, namely the manufacture and distribution of drugs. Lelless testified\nthat the Bloods are also known for committing crimes of violence. Lelless stated that\nvarious members of the Bloods have committed crimes such as \"[m]urders, felonious\nassaults, extortion, robbery, [and] retail theft.\" Although Lelless did not specify the dates\nupon which these various crimes occurred, his discussion of the crimes indicates that\nthey had been ongoing.\n       {\u00b659} Multiple witnesses who were self-identified members of the Bloods testified\nthat they committed a variety of crimes while they were active members of the Bloods.\nBoycan testified that he was imprisoned in Missouri in 1995 for the sale, possession and\n\f                                                                                      - 14 -\n\n\ntrafficking of narcotics, and was imprisoned again in Ohio in 2002 for committing felonious\nassault. Fordham testified that she had been released from prison in June of 2008, after\nhaving served seven years in prison for aggravated arson, which therefore would have\nbeen committed around 2001. Fordham did not say whether her offense was related to\nher affiliation with the Bloods, and Boycan denied that his crimes were gang-related.\n       {\u00b660} The foregoing testimony establishes that the Bloods had multiple members\nwho committed multiple felony offenses and offenses enumerated in R.C.\n2923.41(B)(1)(c).   Although specific dates and timelines were not established, the\ntestimony of the witnesses provides circumstantial evidence from which the trier of fact\ncould infer that at least one of the member's offenses occurred on or after January 1,\n1999, and that the most recent two offenses were within five years of one another. Thus,\nthe State provided sufficient evidence to establish the \"pattern of criminal gang activity\"\nelement.\n       {\u00b661} Bickerstaff's gang specifications were supported by legally sufficient\nevidence. Accordingly, this first portion of Bickerstaff's second assignment of error is\nmeritless.\n       {\u00b662} In the second portion of this assignment of error, Bickerstaff asserts that his\ngang specification verdicts were against the manifest weight of the evidence. In contrast\nto the sufficiency inquiry, when reviewing a judgment under a criminal manifest weight\nstandard of review, \"[t]he court reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all\nreasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in\nresolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a\nmanifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial\nordered.\" State v.

However,\nwe conclude that the jury could have reasonably found from the evidence, as discussed\nabove, that Bickerstaff was guilty of committing a felony offense of violence while\nparticipating in a criminal gang. Bickerstaff offers no reason as to why any of the\ndamaging witness testimony lacked credibility.\n       {\u00b665} Reasonable minds could differ as to whether Bickerstaff's offense was\nmotivated by gang activity or mere personal differences. Officer Cline testified that either\nMaleah Fletcher or Danielle Thompson stated repeatedly right after the shooting that it\nwas gang-related. Maleah Fletcher testified that she knew from her conversations with\nLongmire that he and Bickerstaff were involved in gang activity, and that there was a\nhistory of problems between the two men, but not \"big problems.\" Danielle Thompson\ntestified that at the time of the altercation between Bickerstaff and Longmire at the\nconvenience store, Bickerstaff's girlfriend yelled things about \"gangs, Bloods, Crips.\"\nHowever, Thompson stated that she was not aware of any gang-related problems\nbetween the two men. Willette Fordham testified that Longmire approached Bickerstaff at\nthe convenience store to address some sort of problem between the two of them, but\nFordham did not know what that problem was. Fordham also testified about Bickerstaff's\ngirlfriend's gang-related statements at the time of the altercation.\n       {\u00b666} Considering this testimony, the gang specification is not against the\n\f                                                                                        - 16 -\n\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Although some of the testimony indicated the incident\nwas borne out of personal animosity, there was other testimony that it was gang-related.\nWhen faced with conflicting testimony, neither of which is unbelievable, it is not our\nprovince to substitute our judgment for that of the jury.

In convicting Bickerstaff of the gang specification, the jury did not\nclearly lose its way so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, the\nsecond part of Bickerstaff's second assignment of error is also meritless.\n                                          Merger\n       {\u00b667} In his fourth and final assignment of error, Bickerstaff asserts:\n       {\u00b668} \"The Trial Court Plainly Erred in Failing to Merge the Aggravated Murder\nand Murder Convictions and by Imposing Concurrent Sentences for those Convictions.\"\n       {\u00b669} Bickerstaff argues that the trial court committed plain error in failing to\nmerge Bickerstaff's murder and aggravated murder convictions, because Bickerstaff\ncommitted one act of firing a single shot, killing one victim. The State concedes that the\ntrial court committed plain error, and that the case should be remanded for Bickerstaff to\nbe resentenced subsequent to a merger of the two convictions.\n       {\u00b670} Bickerstaff was convicted on one count of aggravated murder, in violation of\nR.C. 2903.01(A), which provides that \"[n]o person shall purposely, and with prior\ncalculation and design, cause the death of another or the unlawful termination of\nanother's pregnancy.\" Bickerstaff was convicted on one count of murder, in violation of\nR.C. 2903.02(B), which provides, \"[n]o person shall cause the death of another as a\nproximate result of the offender's committing or attempting to commit an offense of\nviolence that is a felony of the first or second degree and that is not a violation of section\n2903.03 or 2903.04 of the Revised Code.\"\n       {\u00b671} The question of whether the two convictions should merge is governed by\nR.C. 2941.25, which provides:\n       {\u00b672} \"(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute\ntwo or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain\n\f                                                                                          - 17 -\n\n\ncounts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\n       {\u00b673} \"(B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more offenses of\ndissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or\nsimilar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or\ninformation may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be\nconvicted of all of them.\"\n       {\u00b674} The Ohio Supreme Court has recently revisited the issue of merger in State\nv. Johnson, --- Ohio St.3d ---, 2010-Ohio-6314, --- N.E.2d ---, wherein the Court reversed\nthe court of appeals' decision that the crimes of felony murder and child endangering did\nnot merge. The Court was unanimous in its judgment and the syllabus language: \"When\ndetermining whether two offenses are allied offenses of similar import subject to merger\nunder R.C. 2941.25, the conduct of the accused must be considered.

Rance\n(1999), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, overruled.)\".\n       {\u00b675} Unfortunately, with respect to the analysis to apply, there were two plurality\nopinions (Brown, Pfeifer, Stratton) and (O'Connor, Lanzinger, Cupp), as well as a third\nminority opinion (O'Donnell, Stratton). Thus, there is no controlling case law to guide the\ncourts of appeals in the application of the syllabus law. See Kraly v. Vannewkirk (1994),\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 633, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">635</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (characterizing prior case as \"of questionable\nprecedential value inasmuch as it was a plurality opinion which failed to receive the\nrequisite support of four justices of this court in order to constitute controlling law\"). Thus,\nwe are left with the statutory language, along with the Supreme Court's mandate that the\naccused's conduct must be considered and that courts should no longer compare the\nelements of offenses solely in the abstract.         Johnson at \u00b644; \u00b668 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment); \u00b672-73 (O'Donnell, J., separately concurring).\n       {\u00b676} The record reflects that Bickerstaff committed the offenses of aggravated\nmurder and murder through the single act of shooting Longmire, and with the single state\nof mind. The trial court therefore committed plain error by failing to merge Bickerstaff's\nconvictions for murder and aggravated murder. The State \"retains the right to elect which\nallied offense to pursue on sentencing on a remand to the trial court after an appeal.\"\n\f                                                                                    - 18 -\n\n\nState v.

This court\nmust therefore remand the issue to the trial court for a de novo sentencing hearing during\nwhich the State may elect to pursue either Bickerstaff's murder or aggravated murder\nconviction, along with their corresponding firearm and gang specifications, for sentencing\npurposes. Accordingly, Bickerstaff's fourth assignment of error is meritorious.\n       {\u00b677} In conclusion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to\nprovide a voluntary manslaughter instruction to the jury, Bickerstaff has not demonstrated\nany prejudice regarding the alleged hearsay statement, and has otherwise waived the\nissue on appeal. Bickerstaff's gang specification conviction is supported by legally\nsufficient evidence, and is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Finally,\nBickerstaff's aggravated murder and murder convictions should have been merged at\nsentencing. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed in part, reversed in\npart, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for resentencing.\nDonofrio, J., concurs.\nVukovich, J., concurs.\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
