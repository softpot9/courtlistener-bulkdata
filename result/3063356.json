INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). Both the Board of Immigration Appeals and\n\nimmigration judge denied the application based on a finding that Diaz-Cardenas\n\nwas not credible. We deny the petition.\n\n         Diaz-Cardenas presents two arguments, but we lack jurisdiction to consider\n\none of those arguments. Diaz-Cardenas argues that he was denied a fair hearing\n\nbecause the asylum office failed timely to transfer his supporting documents for his\n\nremoval hearing and he was denied an opportunity to explain discrepancies\n\nbetween some of those documents and his testimony. Diaz-Cardenas did not\n\npresent that argument to the Board, and \u201cabsent a cognizable excuse or exception,\n\n\u2018we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the\n\n[Board].\u2019\u201d Amaya-Artunduaga v.

See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fF.3d 1262, 1283\u201384 (11th Cir. 2001).

There were numerous inconsistencies\n\nbetween Diaz-Cardenas\u2019s application, his testimony at the removal hearing, and his\n\nsupporting documents. Diaz-Cardenas initially stated in his application that he\n\norganized youth sports events for Major Ricardo Gomez Marin beginning in 1998,\n\nbut Diaz-Cardenas later testified that he worked for Gomez in 1996 and again in\n\n1998. Diaz-Cardenas initially stated in his application that in July 2001 he was\n\nthreatened by several members of the National Liberation Party, but he later\n\ntestified he was threatened by only one individual. Diaz-Cardenas testified that he\n\nwas the intended target of a shooting on December 7, 2001, but a letter submitted\n\nby Gomez stated that the shooting occurred on July 7, 2001. Diaz-Cardenas also\n\ntestified incredibly that a letter from Major Jose Antonio Pereira Sanchez dated\n\nNovember 3, 2001, was written after the shooting and backdated at Diaz-\n\nCardenas\u2019s request. Although Diaz-Cardenas blamed the National Liberation Party\n\nfor his persecution, Gomez and other officials who submitted letters on behalf of\n\nDiaz-Cardenas attributed the persecution to \u201coutlaw groups.\u201d Diaz-Cardenas\n\noffers no explanation for his inconsistencies that would \u201c\u2018compel\u2019 a reasonable fact\n\nfinder\u201d to reverse the adverse credibility finding and conclude that he established\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\feligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.
