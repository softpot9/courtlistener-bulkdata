Theodosia Johnson, Assistant Appellate Defender\n16 Santa Fe, NM\n\n17 for Appellant\n\n18                                 MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n19 VARGAS, Judge.\n\f 1   {1}   A jury convicted Defendant John Mayes of second degree murder, aggravated\n\n 2 burglary, tampering with evidence, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, fraudulent use\n\n 3 of a credit card, and attempted residential burglary in connection with the beating\n\n 4 death of Dr. James Nordstrom. On appeal, Defendant contends that all or parts of his\n\n 5 conviction must be overturned for three separate reasons. First, Defendant contends\n\n 6 that the jury deliberations were tainted and the verdict was in error because the district\n\n 7 court coerced the jury to return a guilty verdict on the second degree murder charge\n\n 8 and refused to acquit Defendant of murder when it received a completed not-guilty\n\n 9 verdict form for voluntary manslaughter, before deliberations were completed on the\n\n10 murder charge. Defendant also argues that his confession should have been suppressed\n\n11 because he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his constitutional\n\n12 rights. Finally, Defendant claims that the district court erroneously sentenced him as\n\n13 an adult for both delinquency and youthful offender offenses, requiring that the\n\n14 delinquency charges be vacated. Unpersuaded by Defendant\u2019s arguments, we affirm\n\n15 his conviction in its entirety.\n\n16 BACKGROUND\n\n17   {2}   On Friday morning, following seven days of trial, the case was submitted to the\n\n18 jury for deliberations. When the jury had not notified the district court of a verdict, by\n\n19 3:30 that afternoon, seven hours into deliberations, the district court called counsel\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f 1 into court and proposed to inquire whether the jury was deadlocked or whether it felt\n\n 2 additional deliberations would be beneficial. Both the State and Defendant objected\n\n 3 to the inquiry, reasoning that the length of deliberations was not surprising given the\n\n 4 gravity of the charges. Noting that the jury had not asked for assistance regarding a\n\n 5 deadlock, the parties argued it was unnecessary for the court to \u201cinterfer[e] with the\n\n 6 process.\u201d The court stated that it felt this had been \u201cquite a long deliberation,\u201d and that\n\n 7 it expected \u201ccounts three and beyond were dealt with in the first hour.\u201d Nonetheless,\n\n 8 the court agreed to allow deliberations to continue for another hour before making an\n\n 9 inquiry into the jury\u2019s progress.\n\n10   {3}   At 4:30 p.m., the district court called the jury back into the court room, and the\n\n11 following exchange took place between the court and foreperson:\n\n12         Court:       Has the jury reached a verdict as to any of the counts?\n\n13         Foreperson: To some counts, yes.\n\n14         Court:      Okay, which counts\u2014without telling me the verdict\u2014tell\n15                     me which counts please there are verdicts for.\n16         Foreperson: Count 2 and on.\n\n17         Court:       Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6?\n\n18         Foreperson: Yes.\n\n19         Court:       There is not a verdict as to Count 1?\n\n20         Foreperson: Correct.\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f 1         Court:       Is there . . . do you and the jury collectively feel that\n 2                      additional deliberations might be fruitful in resolving or\n 3                      arriving at a unanimous verdict as to Count 1?\n\n 4         Foreperson: I can\u2019t say.\n\n 5         Court:       Do you believe that there is a reasonable probability that\n 6                      the jury would be able to agree on a unanimous verdict as\n 7                      to Count 1?\n\n 8         Foreperson: I believe there could, but that\u2019s my intuition.\n\n 9         Court:       . . . Here\u2019s the situation ladies and gentlemen . . . we have\n10                      a little bit of time left today. . . . If you believe that further\n11                      deliberations could be beneficial\u2014not would be, but could\n12                      be and I agree that\u2019s speculation\u2014we\u2019re looking at coming\n13                      back Monday morning. Will you all be able to come back\n14                      Monday morning? Anyone who couldn\u2019t? Alright then.\n15                      Then let me inquire at this point\u2014it\u2019s 4:30 now\u2014would\n16                      you rather work a little while longer or call it, come back\n17                      Monday morning, have a weekend to not think about it, and\n18                      take another whack at it, say about 8:30 Monday morning?\n\n19 The foreperson requested that they be given until 5:00 p.m. to deliberate, and the court\n\n20 agreed. The court then stated, \u201cthe other thing that we need to do, . . . for the counts\n\n21 that you have arrived at unanimous verdicts, I need to have you complete the forms\n\n22 of verdict, and we\u2019ll need to take those verdicts at five o\u2019clock, whether or not we still\n\n23 have more to do on those other counts.\u201d\n\n24   {4}   When the jury returned at 5:00 p.m., the court asked the foreperson, \u201cDo you\n\n25 have the forms of verdict for the ones that you were able to reach a unanimous verdict\n\n26 on?\u201d The foreperson provided the completed forms, and after reviewing those verdict\n\n\n                                                4\n\f 1 forms, the district court called the parties up to the bench. During a bench conference,\n\n 2 the judge revealed the jury had submitted a verdict form finding Defendant not guilty\n\n 3 of manslaughter. Defense counsel argued that, by acquitting Defendant of the\n\n 4 voluntary manslaughter charge, the jury had thereby acquitted Defendant of the first\n\n 5 and second degree murder charges. The court responded that was not necessarily true\n\n 6 because the jury had not yet signed the verdict forms for the first and second degree\n\n 7 murder charges. After the bench conference, the district court read the verdict forms\n\n 8 verbatim in open court; the jury found Defendant guilty of both burglary counts,\n\n 9 tampering with evidence, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, and fraudulent use of\n\n10 a credit card. The district court polled the jury, asking each juror for a yes or no\n\n11 answer as to whether the verdict accurately reflected his or her decision. All jurors\n\n12 answered in the affirmative.\n\n13   {5}   The court then sought clarification regarding the murder charge:\n\n14         I have a count one verdict form that says that you find . . . Defendant not\n15         guilty of voluntary manslaughter. I see no verdict forms for second\n16         degree murder or first degree murder, and I\u2019m going to inquire so that\n17         we\u2019ll have that information on the record. Does that mean that in finding\n18         . . . Defendant not guilty of voluntary manslaughter, you\u2019ve also found\n19         him not guilty of second degree and first degree murder?\n\n20 The foreperson responded, \u201c[t]hat is not correct. We\u2019re still deliberating.\u201d The court\n\n21 stated, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll leave it at that. At this juncture, I\u2019m going to ask that you return\n\n22 Monday morning at 8:30.\u201d Outside the presence of the jury, the district court declined\n\n\n                                                5\n\f 1 to rule on whether jury confusion resulting in an acquittal for a lesser included offense\n\n 2 results in an automatic acquittal on the greater offenses but asked the parties to be\n\n 3 prepared to address the issue on the following Monday.\n\n 4   {6}   On Monday morning, Defendant filed a demand for entry of judgment of\n\n 5 acquittal on the murder count, based on the jury\u2019s not guilty verdict on voluntary\n\n 6 manslaughter during the Friday evening proceedings. The court explained its position\n\n 7 to the parties as follows:\n\n 8         I fully intend to let the situation play out with the jury as to whether they\n 9         reach a verdict or indicate that they cannot and that will happen today,\n10         one way or the other. . . . If it were just that verdict form in and of itself,\n11         I might be a little more inclined to take a quicker action on it. But the\n12         fact is, those folks stood up there and told me that they had not reached\n13         a verdict on first or second degree murder. What they\u2019ve done effectively\n14         by convicting on count two they\u2019ve indicated self defense didn\u2019t work.\n15         By finding not guilty as to the voluntary manslaughter, what they\u2019re\n16         effect[ively] telling us, in reality, is they don\u2019t buy sufficient\n17         provocation, coupled with the fact that they\u2019re still debating first or\n18         second degree murder. Regardless, before I make a call on this issue, and\n19         I\u2019m not going to do it today, and I am not going to terminate the jury\n20         proceedings. I want this court\u2014and of course the appellate courts\u2014to\n21         have as . . . complete a picture as possible as to just how messed up this\n22         jury was in its deliberations . . . I\u2019m going to wait until they either hang\n23         or come up with a verdict.\n\n24 Defense counsel requested that there be \u201cno more inquiries or exchanges with the jury\n\n25 . . . and the court during the course of their deliberations.\u201d The court responded,\n\n26 \u201cNope; if I need to bring them in here and inquire as to whether they\u2019re hung up or\n\n27 not, I by golly will, and after and if I determine that they are hung, I will certainly poll\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f 1 them as to what their vote is[.]\u201d The court had no further interaction with the jury,\n\n 2 however, until it returned after roughly two hours of deliberation on Monday. The jury\n\n 3 found Defendant not guilty of first degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, but\n\n 4 guilty of second degree murder. The district court polled each member of the jury,\n\n 5 each of whom confirmed that verdict accurately reflected his or her decision.\n\n 6 DISCUSSION\n\n 7 Coercion and Acquittal\n\n 8   {7}   Defendant argues that the district court\u2019s unnecessary inquiry into the jury\u2019s\n\n 9 deliberations improperly coerced the jury to return a guilty verdict for the second\n\n10 degree murder charge. Defendant contends that \u201cthe mere fact that the judge\n\n11 questioned the jury\u2019s verdict coerced the jury\u201d both by forcing a decision prematurely\n\n12 and by suggesting the answer the court wanted\u2014that acquittal on the lesser included\n\n13 charge was not an acquittal on the greater charges.\n\n14   {8}   Whether a defendant\u2019s right to procedural due process in jury deliberations has\n\n15 been violated is a legal question that we review de novo. State v. Brothers, 2002-\n\n16 NMCA-110, \u00b6 25, 133 N.M. 36, 59 P.3d 1268; see State v. McCarter, 1980-NMSC-\n\n17 003, \u00b6 7, 93 N.M. 708, 604 P.2d 1242 (holding that the judge\u2019s coercive actions in\n\n18 handling the jury violated the due process guarantee of a fair and impartial trial). A\n\n19 judge instructing a jury once deliberations have begun should give careful\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f 1 consideration to the gravity of crime charged, the nature of the defense, the\n\n 2 complexity of the facts, and the amount of time the jurors have been deliberating. See\n\n 3 State v. Horton, 1953-NMSC-044, \u00b6 15, 57 N.M. 257, 258 P.2d 371. Generally, a\n\n 4 judge\u2019s communication with a deliberating jury is proper \u201cso long as it leaves with the\n\n 5 jury the discretion whether or not it should deliberate further.\u201d State v. Laney, 2003-\n\n 6 NMCA-144, \u00b6 52, 134 N.M. 648, 81 P.3d 591 (internal quotation marks and citation\n\n 7 omitted). In determining whether the jury was coerced to arrive at a verdict, we\n\n 8 consider the actions as well as the circumstances under which the actions arose. Id. \u00b6\n\n 9 56.\n\n10   {9}   In this case, we are asked to measure the impact the judge\u2019s interaction with the\n\n11 jury had on the jury\u2019s verdict. Notwithstanding the objection of both parties, the\n\n12 district court felt it was appropriate to interrupt jury deliberations before the end of the\n\n13 work day to check on the jury\u2019s progress despite the fact that the crimes charged were\n\n14 grave in nature, there was a significant amount of evidence presented, and the jury had\n\n15 not expressed any difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While it may have been\n\n16 nothing more than an attempt to manage its docket on a Friday afternoon, the\n\n17 interruption was unusual. Nonetheless, the parties have failed to provide us with\n\n18 citations to case law with similar facts addressing the propriety of a district court\u2019s\n\n19 interruption of jury deliberation without prompting from the parties, juror confusion,\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f 1 or juror disagreement. Absent such authority, we focus our analysis on the court\u2019s\n\n 2 interactions with, and demeanor in front of, the jury. Laney, 2003-NMCA-144, \u00b6 56\n\n 3 (stating that in assessing coercion, we look to the court\u2019s actions, as well as the\n\n 4 circumstances under which the court\u2019s actions arose).\n\n 5   {10}   Our Supreme Court long ago resolved that it is within the judge\u2019s purview to\n\n 6 inquire of the jury about the need for further jury deliberations. State v. Rickerson,\n\n 7 1981-NMSC-036, \u00b6 7, 95 N.M. 666, 625 P.2d 1183 (acknowledging that inquiries are\n\n 8 part of \u201cthe court\u2019s duty to assure that a verdict is reached\u201d). While such inquiries are\n\n 9 generally the result of a jury deadlock, the parties provide no case law limiting the\n\n10 district court\u2019s authority to inquire to circumstances in which the jury is having\n\n11 difficulty reaching a verdict. Unless the judge\u2019s actions somehow deprived the jury\n\n12 of its discretion, the judge\u2019s statements do not constitute error. While the judge\u2019s\n\n13 actions in this case were admittedly unusual, nothing in his statements was suggestive\n\n14 or coercive. The judge\u2019s questioning was limited to asking whether further\n\n15 deliberations would be beneficial. At no point did the district court require the jury to\n\n16 keep deliberating or inquire how many jurors were voting guilty or not guilty on the\n\n17 murder charge. See Rickerson, 1981-NMSC-036, \u00b6 3 (acknowledging that inquiry into\n\n18 the numerical division of the jury may be reversible error when it is shown to have a\n\n19 coercive effect on the jury); State v. Juan, 2010-NMSC-041, \u00b6 19, 148 N.M. 747, 242\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\f 1 P.3d 314 (concluding that the court\u2019s failure to answer a jury question \u201cleft the jury\n\n 2 with the impermissible impression that it must continue its deliberations indefinitely\u201d\n\n 3 and amounted to reversible error) . The jury\u2019s discretion remained intact throughout\n\n 4 the proceedings.\n\n 5   {11}   Defendant\u2019s coercion argument centers on the district court\u2019s actions regarding\n\n 6 the murder charge, namely, the district court\u2019s efforts to clarify the jury\u2019s progress\n\n 7 regarding its not-yet-final verdict. Our Supreme Court has recognized that the district\n\n 8 court\u2019s ability to conduct inquiries into the jury\u2019s verdict is implicit in the court\u2019s duty\n\n 9 to assure that a verdict is reached. Rickerson, 1981-NMSC-036, \u00b6 7. Clearly the\n\n10 district court\u2019s decision to take verdict forms for the remaining counts, read them into\n\n11 the record, and poll the jury on those counts before the jury had reached a unanimous\n\n12 decision on all counts created confusion in this case. Given the foreperson\u2019s\n\n13 clarification that the jury was still deliberating on the first and second degree murder\n\n14 charges and the additional two-and-half hours of deliberation that followed the district\n\n15 court\u2019s inquiry, however, we see no indication that the jury felt coerced by the judge\u2019s\n\n16 actions and find no due process violation. See Laney, 2003-NMCA-144, \u00b6\u00b6 55-57\n\n17 (reasoning that the absence of a shotgun instruction, the jury\u2019s willingness to continue\n\n18 deliberating, and an additional two hours of deliberation demonstrated that the jury\n\n19 was not coerced).\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f 1 Acquittal\n\n 2   {12}   Defendant also argues that the verdict form finding Defendant not guilty of\n\n 3 voluntary manslaughter should have resulted in an acquittal on the entirety of the\n\n 4 murder charge. The jury was instructed to individually consider each greater offense\n\n 5 before considering a lesser offense:\n\n 6          [T]he jurors first must determine whether they unanimously agree that\n 7          the defendant is guilty of first-degree murder. If they agree that the\n 8          defendant is guilty, the jury enters a guilty verdict for first-degree murder\n 9          and does not need to consider second-degree murder or voluntary\n10          manslaughter. If not, after reasonable deliberation, the jurors must then\n11          consider second-degree murder. The jurors follow the same procedure\n12          with respect to second-degree murder and only consider voluntary\n13          manslaughter if they cannot unanimously agree that the defendant was\n14          guilty of second-degree murder.\n\n15 State v. Phillips, 2017-NMSC-019, \u00b6 4, 396 P.3d 153 (citations omitted); See UJI\n\n16 14-250 NMRA. Defendant argues that because the jury found Defendant not guilty\n\n17 of voluntary manslaughter and the instruction requires consideration of voluntary\n\n18 manslaughter only upon finding the defendant not guilty of first and second degree\n\n19 murder, he should have been acquitted of the murder count in its entirety. We\n\n20 disagree.\n\n21   {13}   Our Supreme Court made clear, in Phillips, that \u201c[i]n the face of juror\n\n22 confusion, the district court possesse[s] significant discretion to undertake proper\n\n23 remedial measures to clarify the jurors\u2019 ambiguous responses.\u201d 2017-NMSC-019, \u00b6 15\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f 1 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While Phillips is factually\n\n 2 distinguishable because it dealt with a jury that could not reach a unanimous verdict,\n\n 3 the Court\u2019s discussion of larger concepts, including a judge\u2019s obligation to clarify\n\n 4 ambiguities in a jury\u2019s verdict and the finality of a verdict, is helpful to our analysis\n\n 5 here. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 14-15, 18. The district court\u2019s poll of the Phillips jury created\n\n 6 ambiguities as to whether the jury was deadlocked on the entire count or only first\n\n 7 degree murder. Because the district court\u2019s actions in that case failed to clarify which\n\n 8 crimes caused a deadlock, the Court remanded for retrial on voluntary manslaughter\n\n 9 only, the lowest offense in the count, because it was unclear as to which crime the jury\n\n10 could not agree. Id. \u00b6 2. In doing so, the Court acknowledged an \u201cinteresting\n\n11 wrinkle\u201d\u2014the jury had sent a note to the judge on the second day of a three-day\n\n12 deliberation, indicating it was hung on second degree murder. Id. \u00b6 18. First, declining\n\n13 to consider the jury\u2019s note as evidence that it was hung on second degree murder, the\n\n14 Court reasoned that the note was \u201cmerely . . . a snapshot of the jury\u2019s thinking partway\n\n15 through deliberations.\u201d Id. A verdict must be rendered in open court and accepted by\n\n16 the court to become final. Id. The court pointed out that the results of a jury poll are\n\n17 \u201cthe ultimate expression of the jury\u2019s verdict at the time of its discharge[,]\u201d and the\n\n18 results of a poll may even supercede any contrary verdict rendered in the jury room.\n\n19 Id.\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f 1   {14}   This case contains a similar wrinkle. Instead of a note sent to the court, the jury\n\n 2 gave the district court a completed voluntary manslaughter verdict prior to the end of\n\n 3 deliberations. The resulting ambiguity was of the district court\u2019s own making. Had the\n\n 4 district court not insisted that the jury provide the verdict forms for the offenses it had\n\n 5 decided, and instead collected all of the verdict forms at the completion of all\n\n 6 deliberations, there would likely be no argument regarding acquittal based on the\n\n 7 voluntary manslaughter verdict.1 However, the district court, after unnecessarily\n\n 8 creating ambiguity regarding the jury\u2019s intentions on the murder count, clarified by\n\n 9 inquiring of the foreperson, \u201c[d]oes that mean that in finding . . . Defendant not guilty\n\n10 of voluntary manslaughter, you\u2019ve also found him not guilty of second degree and\n\n11 first degree murder?\u201d The foreman\u2019s response was succinct and unequivocal: \u201c[t]hat\n\n12 is not correct. We\u2019re still deliberating.\u201d The foreperson not only clarified that the jury\n\n13 had not yet reached a verdict on the murder count, but also clarified that it had not\n\n14 intended to acquit Defendant on that count when it submitted the completed voluntary\n\n15 manslaughter verdict form. At the end of the district court\u2019s inquiry Friday evening,\n\n16 no ambiguity remained. The district court had neither accepted a verdict on the murder\n\n17 count in open court, nor conducted a jury poll. As such, the jury had given no final\n\n\n\n          1\n18          We note that Defendant does not assert the district court erred by accepting the\n19 jury\u2019s verdict as to Counts 2 through 6 prior to completion of deliberations on all\n20 counts.\n\n                                                13\n\f 1 verdict and Defendant was not entitled to acquittal. When polled the following\n\n 2 Monday, after deliberations were concluded, the jury confirmed that it had found\n\n 3 Defendant guilty of second degree murder.\n\n 4   {15}   The unique facts of this case lead us to conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict was free\n\n 5 from coercion. Further, nothing in the record suggests that the verdict form on the\n\n 6 murder count submitted Friday evening represented an \u201cultimate expression of the\n\n 7 jury\u2019s verdict at the time of its discharge.\u201d See id. As a result, we affirm the jury\u2019s\n\n 8 final verdict convicting Defendant of second degree murder.\n\n 9 Confession\n\n10   {16}   Defendant next argues that because he qualifies as a youthful offender, he is\n\n11 entitled to the protections afforded by NMSA 1978, Section 32A-2-14(D) (2009),\n\n12 which requires the State to prove that Defendant\u2019s statements were \u201celicited only after\n\n13 a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver\u201d of his constitutional rights. Defendant\n\n14 asserts that the State did not meet its burden in this regard. We review de novo the\n\n15 district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts in denying a motion to suppress\n\n16 inculpatory statements. State v. Gutierrez, 2011-NMSC-024, \u00b6 7, 150 N.M. 232, 258\n\n17 P.3d 1024. In making that assessment, we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings\n\n18 unless they are clearly erroneous, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\n19 the district court\u2019s ruling. Id.\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\f 1   {17}   The Children\u2019s Code provides that no child suspected of being a delinquent\n\n 2 child shall be interrogated or questioned without first being advised of his or her\n\n 3 constitutional rights and giving a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of those\n\n 4 rights. See \u00a7 32A-2-14(C). Before a child\u2019s statement or confession may be introduced\n\n 5 at a trial or hearing, \u201cthe state shall prove that the statement or confession offered in\n\n 6 evidence was elicited only after a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of the\n\n 7 child\u2019s constitutional rights was obtained.\u201d Section 32A-2-14(D). For persons older\n\n 8 than fifteen years of age, the State\u2019s burden in this regard is by a preponderance of the\n\n 9 evidence. See State v. DeAngelo M., 2015-NMCA-019, \u00b6 15, 344 P.3d 1019 (citing\n\n10 Gutierrez, 2011-NMSC-024, \u00b6 7). Section 32A-2-14(E) requires that, in determining\n\n11 whether a waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, a court must consider the\n\n12 following factors:\n\n13                (1)   the age and education of the respondent;\n\n14                (2)   whether the respondent is in custody;\n\n15                (3) the manner in which the respondent was advised of the\n16          respondent\u2019s rights;\n\n17                 (4) the length of questioning and circumstances under which\n18          the respondent was questioned;\n\n19                (5) the condition of the quarters where the respondent was\n20          being kept at the time of being questioned;\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f 1                (6) the time of day and the treatment of the respondent at the\n 2          time of being questioned;\n\n 3                (7) the mental and physical condition of the respondent at the\n 4          time of being questioned; and\n\n 5                (8) whether the respondent had the counsel of an attorney,\n 6          friends or relatives at the time of being questioned.\n\n 7 The district court examines the totality of circumstances, \u201cgiving particular emphasis\n\n 8 to the factors listed in the statute.\u201d State v. Lasner, 2000-NMSC-038, \u00b6 7, 129 N.M.\n\n 9 806, 14 P.3d 1282 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see id.\n\n10 (acknowledging that the list of factors contained in Section 32A-2-14(E) is \u201ca\n\n11 codification of the totality-of-the-circumstances test\u201d); State v. Wyatt B., 2015-\n\n12 NMCA-110, \u00b6 19, 339 P.3d 165 (stating that \u201cthe applicable test for reviewing\n\n13 whether a child waived his or her statutory right is the same as that of an adult\u201d).\n\n14   {18}   Defendant was interviewed twice: first on June 10, 2011, and then again the\n\n15 next day on June 11, 2011. Defendant\u2019s interview on the first day occurred in\n\n16 segments, in an interview room that was approximately 10' x 10', and contained a\n\n17 bench, two chairs, and a one-way observation window. Two officers were present\n\n18 throughout Defendant\u2019s interview. The first segment began at 4:21 p.m. and lasted\n\n19 fifty-nine minutes. The officers then took a twenty-minute break, and initiated a\n\n20 second interview that lasted approximately thirty minutes. After another twenty-\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f 1 minute break, a third interview took place, which lasted approximately six to seven\n\n 2 minutes.\n\n 3   {19}   At the time of the interview, Defendant was three months shy of his eighteenth\n\n 4 birthday and had completed eleventh grade. When the interviewing officers arrived,\n\n 5 Defendant was handcuffed and in custody, but was released from the handcuffs before\n\n 6 the interview began. The officers provided Defendant with a standard form advising\n\n 7 him of his rights, and he initialed the form to acknowledge that he understood. The\n\n 8 form stated:\n\n 9          You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be\n10          used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer,\n11          family member or friend for advice before we ask you any questions, and\n12          to have him/her present during any questioning. If you cannot afford a\n13          lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you free of charge by the court\n14          before any questioning. If you wish to answer questions now without a\n15          lawyer, family member or friend present, you have the right to stop\n16          answering questions at any time. You also have a right to stop answering\n17          questions at any time until you have talked to a lawyer, family member\n18          or friend.\n\n19 There was a blank space after each sentence, in which Defendant signed his initials.\n\n20 Defendant also initialed to acknowledge each of the following waivers:\n\n21          I have read the statement of my rights shown above. I have also had my\n22          rights read and explained to me. I understand what my rights are. I am\n23          willing to answer questions and make a statement. I do not want a lawyer\n24          present. I do not want a family member or friend present. I understand\n25          and know what I am doing. No promises or threats of any kind have been\n26          made to me and no pressure of any kind has been used against me.\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\f 1   {20}   During the interview, Defendant appeared clean, rested, coherent, and alert.\n\n 2 Defendant acted in a calm and polite manner toward the interviewing officers,\n\n 3 articulating and communicating clearly. Defendant gave no indication that he was\n\n 4 uneducated or confused by the questions being posed to him. Though Defendant\u2019s\n\n 5 parents were present in the building at the time of the interview, Defendant was not\n\n 6 informed of their presence; and, while his parents were not with Defendant during the\n\n 7 interview, he was advised that he could have them present if he wanted.\n\n 8   {21}   The next day, June 11, 2011, the officers interviewed Defendant, again doing\n\n 9 so in the afternoon. That interview took place in a room containing a table with chairs\n\n10 on both sides. The officers began the interview by asking Defendant whether an\n\n11 attorney had been assigned to him, to which Defendant answered no. Though\n\n12 Defendant did not fill out an additional waiver form, the officer went over the rights\n\n13 from the waiver the day before and asked whether Defendant remembered that he had\n\n14 those rights; Defendant responded that he remembered, and he agreed to speak with\n\n15 the officers. Defendant was not in handcuffs for this interview. Defendant\u2019s demeanor\n\n16 was similar to the day before, and he was composed, cooperative, and polite. Again,\n\n17 the officer did not observe anything unusual in Defendant\u2019s behavior or demeanor.\n\n18   {22}   Prior to trial, Defendant filed a motion to suppress inculpatory statements that\n\n19 he gave to the police during these interviews. The State\u2019s response clarified that it was\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\f 1 only seeking to introduce statements Defendant made after he was adequately advised\n\n 2 of his rights, and it included digital recordings of Defendant\u2019s interviews. The district\n\n 3 court held a hearing on the motion, during which the State offered the testimony of the\n\n 4 officer involved in Defendant\u2019s interviews. The State also offered evidence that\n\n 5 Defendant previously had his rights explained to him in an unrelated matter seven\n\n 6 months earlier. In that instance, Defendant had a similar form read and explained to\n\n 7 him, and he signed and initialed that form, waiving his rights. There was no indication\n\n 8 or assertion that Defendant did not understand his rights or the implications of his\n\n 9 waiver on that occasion either.\n\n10   {23}   Defense counsel then called Maxann Shwartz, a licensed clinical psychologist,\n\n11 to testify regarding the voluntariness of Defendant\u2019s waiver. Shwartz testified that\n\n12 Defendant was slower to develop than his peers because he had been neglected when\n\n13 he was younger. She also noted that English was not Defendant\u2019s first language, and\n\n14 that any language difficulties Defendant had would be made worse when he was under\n\n15 stress. Shwartz characterized Defendant as suffering from reactive attachment\n\n16 disorder, which led Defendant to develop personality styles to please others; she\n\n17 explained that in order to avoid difficulties, Defendant would avoid asking for things\n\n18 and making his needs known. The best way for Defendant to have his rights explained\n\n19 to him, according to Shwartz, would be through a slow, piece-by-piece explanation.\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f 1 Shwartz concluded that Defendant was unable to assert his rights during the June\n\n 2 interviews. Shwartz explained that Defendant was likely unable to comprehend the\n\n 3 significance of his decision to waive his rights because he was functioning \u201clike a\n\n 4 child\u2014a seven-year-old.\u201d Shwartz also testified, however, that Defendant was \u201cpretty\n\n 5 bright\u201d intellectually and that he did well in school. She agreed with the State on cross\n\n 6 examination that, after reviewing the recordings of Defendant\u2019s statements to police,\n\n 7 nothing in Defendant\u2019s behavior was unusual or would have indicated to the officers\n\n 8 that he had any sort of impairment; according to Shwartz, \u201cthey would have no idea.\u201d\n\n 9   {24}   The district court, after considering the parties\u2019 arguments and listening to the\n\n10 recordings of the interviews, issued an order denying Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress\n\n11 his inculpatory statements. The district court found that at the time of the interview,\n\n12 Defendant was seventeen years old, had completed the eleventh grade, and made good\n\n13 grades in school. It acknowledged that Defendant was in custody during both\n\n14 interviews and found the officer\u2019s testimony regarding the location, conditions, and\n\n15 length of the interviews to be credible. Regarding the waiver of Defendant\u2019s rights,\n\n16 the district court found that Defendant \u201cwas properly advised of his rights\n\n17 immediately prior to the first interview and initialed and signed a written rights\n\n18 waiver.\u201d It also took note of the fact that Defendant had undergone questioning on an\n\n19 unrelated matter approximately six months earlier, had his rights explained to him,\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\f 1 and waived his rights in that interview as well. The district court pointed out that,\n\n 2 though Defendant may have been suffering from a lack of sleep, there was \u201cnothing\n\n 3 unusual about the mental or physical condition of [D]efendant at the time of the\n\n 4 questioning[, . . . and] he appeared clean, rested, calm, polite and articulate.\u201d The\n\n 5 district court also found that while Defendant did not have the counsel of an attorney,\n\n 6 friend, or relative at the time of questioning, he had spoken with his parents between\n\n 7 the first and second interview.\n\n 8   {25}   Having considered and made findings regarding each of the factors listed in\n\n 9 Section 32A-2-14(E), the district court turned to case law and the testimony of\n\n10 Shwartz. Noting the broad implications of Defendant\u2019s argument, the district court\n\n11 declined to apply a rule requiring officers to \u201cquiz the suspect to confirm an in-depth\n\n12 understanding of the waiver[,]\u201d and characterized such a rule as \u201cburdensome and\n\n13 onerous[.]\u201d The district court also specifically declined to adopt Shwartz\u2019s testimony\n\n14 because it believed that following Shwartz\u2019s opinions would lead to the result that \u201cno\n\n15 juvenile could ever validly waive Miranda rights.\u201d As a result, the district court\n\n16 concluded that the State proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant\u2019s\n\n17 waiver was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given.\n\n18   {26}   On appeal, rather than explicitly challenging the district court\u2019s findings,\n\n19 Defendant asserts that the district court should have considered Shwartz\u2019s testimony\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\f 1 regarding frontal lobe development in children and its impact on a child\u2019s ability to\n\n 2 make a knowing and intelligent waiver in its assessment of the totality of\n\n 3 circumstances. Defendant also does not explicitly challenge the district court\u2019s ruling\n\n 4 on the basis that it did not consider all eight factors enumerated in Section 32A-2-\n\n 5 14(E), instead, arguing that the district court erred in refusing to consider Shwartz\u2019s\n\n 6 testimony that Defendant was unable to assert or comprehend his rights at the time of\n\n 7 questioning.\n\n 8   {27}   The district court was free to weigh the testimony and determine Shwartz\u2019s\n\n 9 credibility in making its factual findings. See State v. Gonzales, 1997-NMSC-050,\n\n10 \u00b6 18, 124 N.M. 171, 947 P.2d 128 (\u201cDetermining credibility and weighing evidence\n\n11 are tasks entrusted to [a district] court sitting as fact-finder.\u201d); see also State v. Maes,\n\n12 1983-NMCA-073, \u00b6 16, 100 N.M. 78, 665 P.2d 1169 (recognizing that the district\n\n13 court acts as the fact-finder in motions to suppress), abrogated on other grounds as\n\n14 recognized by State v. Armijo, 2005-NMCA-010, \u00b6 28, 136 N.M. 723, 104 P.3d 1114.\n\n15 In weighing the evidence, the district court is free to reject even uncontroverted expert\n\n16 opinion. See State v. Alberico, 1993-NMSC-047, \u00b6 36, 116 N.M. 156, 861 P.2d 192\n\n17 (\u201c[A]n expert\u2019s opinion is not conclusive of a fact in issue even though the opinion\n\n18 may be uncontroverted.\u201d); State v. Mireles, 2004-NMCA-100, \u00b6 35, 136 N.M. 337,\n\n19 98 P.3d 727 (acknowledging that it is \u201cthe fact-finder\u2019s prerogative\u201d to reject expert\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f 1 testimony). The district court \u201cspecifically decline[d] to adopt\u201d Shwartz\u2019s testimony\n\n 2 in this case, explaining that it felt Shwartz had an insufficient foundation on which to\n\n 3 base her conclusions, having only spoken with Defendant three times and having run\n\n 4 no tests on Defendant. Furthermore, the district court found Shwartz\u2019s conclusions\n\n 5 unpersuasive in light of evidence regarding Defendant\u2019s behavior during two\n\n 6 interviews and his performance during a preliminary hearing. The district court\u2019s\n\n 7 findings in this case were supported by the evidence, and it did not err in rejecting\n\n 8 Shwartz\u2019s testimony.\n\n 9   {28}   Defendant also acknowledges that the district court considered each of the eight\n\n10 factors listed in Section 32A-2-14(E), but complains that its consideration of those\n\n11 factors was nominal. We are unpersuaded. Of the eight factors, only the last\n\n12 one\u2014whether Defendant had counsel of an attorney, friends or relatives at the time\n\n13 of questioning\u2013weighs in Defendant\u2019s favor. That single factor is not sufficient to\n\n14 overcome all of the other circumstances supporting the knowing, intelligent, and\n\n15 voluntary waiver of his rights, including that Defendant was almost eighteen, was\n\n16 intelligent, was not handcuffed during the interviews, and was questioned during the\n\n17 afternoon for short periods of time with breaks in between in an appropriate\n\n18 environment while he was clean and rested, and in a coherent and alert state of mind.\n\n19 Furthermore, the district court also considered in its analysis of the totality of\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f 1 circumstances, Defendant\u2019s demeanor during pretrial hearings and the fact that the\n\n 2 same rights had been explained to him a few months earlier without any challenge to\n\n 3 the validity of waiver. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that, based on\n\n 4 the evidence presented during the suppression hearing and the totality of\n\n 5 circumstances, Defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\n\n 6 Sentence\n\n 7   {29}   Because Defendant was a minor when the incident occurred, the district court\n\n 8 held an amenability hearing following his conviction and prior to sentencing in\n\n 9 accordance with NMSA 1978, \u00a7 32A-2-20(A) (2009). The district court found by\n\n10 clear and convincing evidence that Defendant was not amenable to treatment and not\n\n11 eligible for commitment to an institution for children. The district court subsequently\n\n12 sentenced Defendant, as an adult, to thirty-three years of incarceration, followed by\n\n13 two years of parole.\n\n14   {30}   Defendant argues that he cannot be sentenced as an adult for the delinquency\n\n15 offenses; and, because he was adjudicated guilty of both delinquency offenses and\n\n16 youthful offender offenses, he asks that we vacate his convictions for the delinquency\n\n17 offenses. As support for this argument, Defendant relies on Section 32A-2-20(E), and\n\n18 our Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in State v. Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, 148 N.M. 1, 229\n\n19 P.3d 474, and State v. Muniz, 2003-NMSC-021, 134 N.M. 152, 74 P.3d 86,\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f 1 superceded by statute on other grounds as recognized by Jones, 2010-NMSC-012,\n\n 2 \u00b6 19. Defendant neither challenges the district court\u2019s decision to sentence him as an\n\n 3 adult based on his status as a youthful offender, nor asserts the district court erred in\n\n 4 finding that he was not amenable to treatment and not eligible for commitment to an\n\n 5 institution. \u201cWe review the [district] court\u2019s sentencing for an abuse of discretion.\u201d\n\n 6 State v. Montoya, 2015-NMSC-010, \u00b6 63, 345 P.3d 1056 (internal quotation marks\n\n 7 and citation omitted).\n\n 8   {31}   A delinquent child is one who has committed a delinquent act, such as the\n\n 9 unlawful taking of a motor vehicle or an offense punishable as a felony. NMSA 1978,\n\n10 \u00a7 32A-2-3(A), (B) (2009). A child is characterized as a youthful offender if he is a\n\n11 delinquent child who is fourteen to eighteen years of age when he commits at least one\n\n12 of thirteen offenses enumerated in the Act, including second degree murder and\n\n13 aggravated burglary. Section 32A-2-3(J)(1).\n\n14   {32}   The district court sentenced Defendant to fifteen years incarceration for second\n\n15 degree murder\u2014a lesser included offense to first degree murder charged in Count 1\n\n16 of Defendant\u2019s indictment\u2014and nine years for aggravated burglary. The remaining\n\n17 four felony convictions earned Defendant an additional nine years. An adjudication\n\n18 for second degree murder and aggravated burglary elevates a delinquent child to a\n\n19 youthful offender under the definitions set forth in Section 32A-2-3(J), while the\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\f 1 remaining offenses are delinquent acts under the statute. Section 32A-2-3(A). Under\n\n 2 Section 32A-2-20(A), the district court has the discretion to sentence a youthful\n\n 3 offender as either an adult or juvenile. \u201cIf the court invokes an adult sentence, the\n\n 4 court may sentence the child to less than, but shall not exceed, the mandatory adult\n\n 5 sentence.\u201d Section 32A-2-20(E).\n\n 6   {33}   In State v. Montano, 1995-NMCA-065, \u00b6 7, 120 N.M. 218, 900 P.2d 967, we\n\n 7 recognized that a conviction for a delinquent act may result in an adult sentence where\n\n 8 the defendant is also convicted and sentenced as an adult for a youthful offender\n\n 9 offense. There, the defendant was convicted of two crimes: one that the statute\n\n10 enumerated as a delinquent offense, and one that the statute enumerated as a youthful\n\n11 offender offense. Id. \u00b6 4. After being sentenced as an adult for both offenses, the\n\n12 defendant appealed, arguing that the court lacked authority to sentence him as an adult\n\n13 for the delinquent offense. Id. \u00b6 5. Looking to case law, we noted that\n\n14 jurisdiction\u2014both personal and subject matter\u2014transfers from children\u2019s court to\n\n15 district court where a juvenile is to be prosecuted as an adult. Id. \u00b6 7; see also \u00a7 32A-\n\n16 2-20(E) (noting that invoking an adult sentence \u201cterminates the jurisdiction of the\n\n17 court over the child with respect to the delinquent acts alleged in the petition\u201d).\n\n18 Montano emphasized that an anomaly existed in allowing both the district court and\n\n19 the children\u2019s court to have jurisdiction over a youthful offender so that a defendant\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\f 1 \u201cwould be subject to rehabilitation as a juvenile, while at the same time he could be\n\n 2 sentenced to prison as an adult offender.\u201d 1995-NMCA-065, \u00b6 5 (internal quotation\n\n 3 marks and citation omitted). Though acknowledging the \u201ctheoretical possibilities\u201d of\n\n 4 a dual sentencing scheme where a court could sentence someone both as an adult and\n\n 5 as a juvenile, Montano ultimately rejected such a scheme, reasoning that it \u201cfail[s] to\n\n 6 address the anomaly of sentencing a defendant to be rehabilitated as a juvenile when\n\n 7 there has been a determination that the defendant cannot be rehabilitated in available\n\n 8 juvenile facilities.\u201d Id. \u00b6 6. We then looked to the statute, noting our obligation to\n\n 9 avoid unreasonable interpretations and applications of its language. Seeing no\n\n10 ambiguity in the statute\u2019s language that would warrant an in-depth analysis of that\n\n11 language, we concluded that, \u201c[b]ased on the statutory scheme and caselaw\n\n12 concerning the transfer of juveniles to district court,\u201d the Legislature intended any\n\n13 juvenile adjudicated for a youthful offender offense \u201cto be subject to adult sanctions\n\n14 under Section 32A-2-20 for any offense in the same case.\u201d Montano, 1995-NMCA-\n\n15 065, \u00b6 7 (emphasis in original). As a result, we affirmed the defendant\u2019s adult sentence\n\n16 for an offense enumerated as a delinquent act under the statute.\n\n17   {34}   Montano guides our analysis in this instance. Though Montano dealt with a\n\n18 previous version of this statute, the relevant language remains the same. Defendant\u2019s\n\n19 convictions for second degree murder and aggravated burglary are clearly youthful\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\f 1 offender offenses under the statute. See \u00a7 32A-2-3. The statute provides the district\n\n 2 court with discretion to sentence Defendant as an adult. See \u00a7 32A-2-20(A). Indeed,\n\n 3 Defendant neither argues that he was improperly sentenced as an adult for the second\n\n 4 degree murder and aggravated burglary charges, nor asserts that he was improperly\n\n 5 characterized as a youthful offender. According to Montano, if the district court\n\n 6 properly sentenced Defendant as an adult for the youthful offender offenses, then it\n\n 7 could properly sentence Defendant as an adult for the remaining offenses. By\n\n 8 acknowledging the propriety of his sentence for the youthful offender counts,\n\n 9 Defendant has failed to demonstrate the district court erred in sentencing him as an\n\n10 adult for the remaining delinquency counts.\n\n11   {35}   To the extent that Defendant cites to Muniz and Jones, as support for his\n\n12 position, we are unpersuaded. Muniz and Jones are distinguishable, as they dealt with\n\n13 the district court\u2019s authority to impose an adult sentence based on a serious youthful\n\n14 offender charge that had been dropped\u2014either as a result of plea negotiations or the\n\n15 prosecutor\u2019s discretion. See \u00a7 32A-2-3(H) (defining \u201cserious youthful offender\u201d as \u201can\n\n16 individual fifteen to eighteen years of age who is charged with and indicted . . . for\n\n17 first degree murder\u201d). In addition, the Legislature \u201clargely abrogated\u201d Muniz by\n\n18 amending Section 32A-2-20 in 2005, while Jones focused on whether an amenability\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f1 hearing was required under Section 32A-2-20(B). See Jones, 2010-NMSC-012, \u00b6\u00b6 19,\n\n2 23-48.\n\n3 CONCLUSION\n\n4   {36}   Defendant has failed to demonstrate error in the proceedings below. We\n\n5 therefore affirm Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.\n\n6   {37}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n7\n8                                       JULIE J.

On appeal, Defendant contends that all or parts of his\n\n 5 conviction must be overturned for three separate reasons. First, Defendant contends\n\n 6 that the jury deliberations were tainted and the verdict was in error because the district\n\n 7 court coerced the jury to return a guilty verdict on the second degree murder charge\n\n 8 and refused to acquit Defendant of murder when it received a completed not-guilty\n\n 9 verdict form for voluntary manslaughter, before deliberations were completed on the\n\n10 murder charge. Defendant also argues that his confession should have been suppressed\n\n11 because he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his constitutional\n\n12 rights. Finally, Defendant claims that the district court erroneously sentenced him as\n\n13 an adult for both delinquency and youthful offender offenses, requiring that the\n\n14 delinquency charges be vacated. Unpersuaded by Defendant\u2019s arguments, we affirm\n\n15 his conviction in its entirety.\n\n16 BACKGROUND\n\n17   {2}   On Friday morning, following seven days of trial, the case was submitted to the\n\n18 jury for deliberations. When the jury had not notified the district court of a verdict, by\n\n19 3:30 that afternoon, seven hours into deliberations, the district court called counsel\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f 1 into court and proposed to inquire whether the jury was deadlocked or whether it felt\n\n 2 additional deliberations would be beneficial. Both the State and Defendant objected\n\n 3 to the inquiry, reasoning that the length of deliberations was not surprising given the\n\n 4 gravity of the charges. Noting that the jury had not asked for assistance regarding a\n\n 5 deadlock, the parties argued it was unnecessary for the court to \u201cinterfer[e] with the\n\n 6 process.\u201d The court stated that it felt this had been \u201cquite a long deliberation,\u201d and that\n\n 7 it expected \u201ccounts three and beyond were dealt with in the first hour.\u201d Nonetheless,\n\n 8 the court agreed to allow deliberations to continue for another hour before making an\n\n 9 inquiry into the jury\u2019s progress.\n\n10   {3}   At 4:30 p.m., the district court called the jury back into the court room, and the\n\n11 following exchange took place between the court and foreperson:\n\n12         Court:       Has the jury reached a verdict as to any of the counts?\n\n13         Foreperson: To some counts, yes.\n\n14         Court:      Okay, which counts\u2014without telling me the verdict\u2014tell\n15                     me which counts please there are verdicts for.\n16         Foreperson: Count 2 and on.\n\n17         Court:       Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6?\n\n18         Foreperson: Yes.\n\n19         Court:       There is not a verdict as to Count 1?\n\n20         Foreperson: Correct.\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f 1         Court:       Is there . . . do you and the jury collectively feel that\n 2                      additional deliberations might be fruitful in resolving or\n 3                      arriving at a unanimous verdict as to Count 1?\n\n 4         Foreperson: I can\u2019t say.\n\n 5         Court:       Do you believe that there is a reasonable probability that\n 6                      the jury would be able to agree on a unanimous verdict as\n 7                      to Count 1?\n\n 8         Foreperson: I believe there could, but that\u2019s my intuition.\n\n 9         Court:       . . . Here\u2019s the situation ladies and gentlemen . . . we have\n10                      a little bit of time left today. . . . If you believe that further\n11                      deliberations could be beneficial\u2014not would be, but could\n12                      be and I agree that\u2019s speculation\u2014we\u2019re looking at coming\n13                      back Monday morning. Will you all be able to come back\n14                      Monday morning? Anyone who couldn\u2019t? Alright then.\n15                      Then let me inquire at this point\u2014it\u2019s 4:30 now\u2014would\n16                      you rather work a little while longer or call it, come back\n17                      Monday morning, have a weekend to not think about it, and\n18                      take another whack at it, say about 8:30 Monday morning?\n\n19 The foreperson requested that they be given until 5:00 p.m. to deliberate, and the court\n\n20 agreed. The court then stated, \u201cthe other thing that we need to do, . . . for the counts\n\n21 that you have arrived at unanimous verdicts, I need to have you complete the forms\n\n22 of verdict, and we\u2019ll need to take those verdicts at five o\u2019clock, whether or not we still\n\n23 have more to do on those other counts.\u201d\n\n24   {4}   When the jury returned at 5:00 p.m., the court asked the foreperson, \u201cDo you\n\n25 have the forms of verdict for the ones that you were able to reach a unanimous verdict\n\n26 on?\u201d The foreperson provided the completed forms, and after reviewing those verdict\n\n\n                                                4\n\f 1 forms, the district court called the parties up to the bench. During a bench conference,\n\n 2 the judge revealed the jury had submitted a verdict form finding Defendant not guilty\n\n 3 of manslaughter. Defense counsel argued that, by acquitting Defendant of the\n\n 4 voluntary manslaughter charge, the jury had thereby acquitted Defendant of the first\n\n 5 and second degree murder charges. The court responded that was not necessarily true\n\n 6 because the jury had not yet signed the verdict forms for the first and second degree\n\n 7 murder charges. After the bench conference, the district court read the verdict forms\n\n 8 verbatim in open court; the jury found Defendant guilty of both burglary counts,\n\n 9 tampering with evidence, unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, and fraudulent use of\n\n10 a credit card. The district court polled the jury, asking each juror for a yes or no\n\n11 answer as to whether the verdict accurately reflected his or her decision. All jurors\n\n12 answered in the affirmative.\n\n13   {5}   The court then sought clarification regarding the murder charge:\n\n14         I have a count one verdict form that says that you find . . . Defendant not\n15         guilty of voluntary manslaughter. I see no verdict forms for second\n16         degree murder or first degree murder, and I\u2019m going to inquire so that\n17         we\u2019ll have that information on the record. Does that mean that in finding\n18         . . . Defendant not guilty of voluntary manslaughter, you\u2019ve also found\n19         him not guilty of second degree and first degree murder?\n\n20 The foreperson responded, \u201c[t]hat is not correct. We\u2019re still deliberating.\u201d The court\n\n21 stated, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll leave it at that. At this juncture, I\u2019m going to ask that you return\n\n22 Monday morning at 8:30.\u201d Outside the presence of the jury, the district court declined\n\n\n                                                5\n\f 1 to rule on whether jury confusion resulting in an acquittal for a lesser included offense\n\n 2 results in an automatic acquittal on the greater offenses but asked the parties to be\n\n 3 prepared to address the issue on the following Monday.\n\n 4   {6}   On Monday morning, Defendant filed a demand for entry of judgment of\n\n 5 acquittal on the murder count, based on the jury\u2019s not guilty verdict on voluntary\n\n 6 manslaughter during the Friday evening proceedings. The court explained its position\n\n 7 to the parties as follows:\n\n 8         I fully intend to let the situation play out with the jury as to whether they\n 9         reach a verdict or indicate that they cannot and that will happen today,\n10         one way or the other. . . . If it were just that verdict form in and of itself,\n11         I might be a little more inclined to take a quicker action on it. But the\n12         fact is, those folks stood up there and told me that they had not reached\n13         a verdict on first or second degree murder. What they\u2019ve done effectively\n14         by convicting on count two they\u2019ve indicated self defense didn\u2019t work.\n15         By finding not guilty as to the voluntary manslaughter, what they\u2019re\n16         effect[ively] telling us, in reality, is they don\u2019t buy sufficient\n17         provocation, coupled with the fact that they\u2019re still debating first or\n18         second degree murder. Regardless, before I make a call on this issue, and\n19         I\u2019m not going to do it today, and I am not going to terminate the jury\n20         proceedings.

The jury\n\n 3 found Defendant not guilty of first degree murder and voluntary manslaughter, but\n\n 4 guilty of second degree murder. The district court polled each member of the jury,\n\n 5 each of whom confirmed that verdict accurately reflected his or her decision.\n\n 6 DISCUSSION\n\n 7 Coercion and Acquittal\n\n 8   {7}   Defendant argues that the district court\u2019s unnecessary inquiry into the jury\u2019s\n\n 9 deliberations improperly coerced the jury to return a guilty verdict for the second\n\n10 degree murder charge. Defendant contends that \u201cthe mere fact that the judge\n\n11 questioned the jury\u2019s verdict coerced the jury\u201d both by forcing a decision prematurely\n\n12 and by suggesting the answer the court wanted\u2014that acquittal on the lesser included\n\n13 charge was not an acquittal on the greater charges.\n\n14   {8}   Whether a defendant\u2019s right to procedural due process in jury deliberations has\n\n15 been violated is a legal question that we review de novo.

Notwithstanding the objection of both parties, the\n\n12 district court felt it was appropriate to interrupt jury deliberations before the end of the\n\n13 work day to check on the jury\u2019s progress despite the fact that the crimes charged were\n\n14 grave in nature, there was a significant amount of evidence presented, and the jury had\n\n15 not expressed any difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While it may have been\n\n16 nothing more than an attempt to manage its docket on a Friday afternoon, the\n\n17 interruption was unusual.

The jury\u2019s discretion remained intact throughout\n\n 4 the proceedings.\n\n 5   {11}   Defendant\u2019s coercion argument centers on the district court\u2019s actions regarding\n\n 6 the murder charge, namely, the district court\u2019s efforts to clarify the jury\u2019s progress\n\n 7 regarding its not-yet-final verdict. Our Supreme Court has recognized that the district\n\n 8 court\u2019s ability to conduct inquiries into the jury\u2019s verdict is implicit in the court\u2019s duty\n\n 9 to assure that a verdict is reached. Rickerson, 1981-NMSC-036, \u00b6 7. Clearly the\n\n10 district court\u2019s decision to take verdict forms for the remaining counts, read them into\n\n11 the record, and poll the jury on those counts before the jury had reached a unanimous\n\n12 decision on all counts created confusion in this case. Given the foreperson\u2019s\n\n13 clarification that the jury was still deliberating on the first and second degree murder\n\n14 charges and the additional two-and-half hours of deliberation that followed the district\n\n15 court\u2019s inquiry, however, we see no indication that the jury felt coerced by the judge\u2019s\n\n16 actions and find no due process violation. See Laney, 2003-NMCA-144, \u00b6\u00b6 55-57\n\n17 (reasoning that the absence of a shotgun instruction, the jury\u2019s willingness to continue\n\n18 deliberating, and an additional two hours of deliberation demonstrated that the jury\n\n19 was not coerced).\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f 1 Acquittal\n\n 2   {12}   Defendant also argues that the verdict form finding Defendant not guilty of\n\n 3 voluntary manslaughter should have resulted in an acquittal on the entirety of the\n\n 4 murder charge. The jury was instructed to individually consider each greater offense\n\n 5 before considering a lesser offense:\n\n 6          [T]he jurors first must determine whether they unanimously agree that\n 7          the defendant is guilty of first-degree murder. If they agree that the\n 8          defendant is guilty, the jury enters a guilty verdict for first-degree murder\n 9          and does not need to consider second-degree murder or voluntary\n10          manslaughter. If not, after reasonable deliberation, the jurors must then\n11          consider second-degree murder. The jurors follow the same procedure\n12          with respect to second-degree murder and only consider voluntary\n13          manslaughter if they cannot unanimously agree that the defendant was\n14          guilty of second-degree murder.\n\n15 State v.

Defendant argues that because the jury found Defendant not guilty\n\n17 of voluntary manslaughter and the instruction requires consideration of voluntary\n\n18 manslaughter only upon finding the defendant not guilty of first and second degree\n\n19 murder, he should have been acquitted of the murder count in its entirety. We\n\n20 disagree.\n\n21   {13}   Our Supreme Court made clear, in Phillips, that \u201c[i]n the face of juror\n\n22 confusion, the district court possesse[s] significant discretion to undertake proper\n\n23 remedial measures to clarify the jurors\u2019 ambiguous responses.\u201d 2017-NMSC-019, \u00b6 15\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\f 1 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While Phillips is factually\n\n 2 distinguishable because it dealt with a jury that could not reach a unanimous verdict,\n\n 3 the Court\u2019s discussion of larger concepts, including a judge\u2019s obligation to clarify\n\n 4 ambiguities in a jury\u2019s verdict and the finality of a verdict, is helpful to our analysis\n\n 5 here. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 14-15, 18. The district court\u2019s poll of the Phillips jury created\n\n 6 ambiguities as to whether the jury was deadlocked on the entire count or only first\n\n 7 degree murder. Because the district court\u2019s actions in that case failed to clarify which\n\n 8 crimes caused a deadlock, the Court remanded for retrial on voluntary manslaughter\n\n 9 only, the lowest offense in the count, because it was unclear as to which crime the jury\n\n10 could not agree. Id. \u00b6 2. In doing so, the Court acknowledged an \u201cinteresting\n\n11 wrinkle\u201d\u2014the jury had sent a note to the judge on the second day of a three-day\n\n12 deliberation, indicating it was hung on second degree murder. Id. \u00b6 18. First, declining\n\n13 to consider the jury\u2019s note as evidence that it was hung on second degree murder, the\n\n14 Court reasoned that the note was \u201cmerely . . . a snapshot of the jury\u2019s thinking partway\n\n15 through deliberations.\u201d Id. A verdict must be rendered in open court and accepted by\n\n16 the court to become final. Id. The court pointed out that the results of a jury poll are\n\n17 \u201cthe ultimate expression of the jury\u2019s verdict at the time of its discharge[,]\u201d and the\n\n18 results of a poll may even supercede any contrary verdict rendered in the jury room.\n\n19 Id.\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f 1   {14}   This case contains a similar wrinkle. Instead of a note sent to the court, the jury\n\n 2 gave the district court a completed voluntary manslaughter verdict prior to the end of\n\n 3 deliberations. The resulting ambiguity was of the district court\u2019s own making. Had the\n\n 4 district court not insisted that the jury provide the verdict forms for the offenses it had\n\n 5 decided, and instead collected all of the verdict forms at the completion of all\n\n 6 deliberations, there would likely be no argument regarding acquittal based on the\n\n 7 voluntary manslaughter verdict.1 However, the district court, after unnecessarily\n\n 8 creating ambiguity regarding the jury\u2019s intentions on the murder count, clarified by\n\n 9 inquiring of the foreperson, \u201c[d]oes that mean that in finding . . . Defendant not guilty\n\n10 of voluntary manslaughter, you\u2019ve also found him not guilty of second degree and\n\n11 first degree murder?\u201d The foreman\u2019s response was succinct and unequivocal: \u201c[t]hat\n\n12 is not correct. We\u2019re still deliberating.\u201d The foreperson not only clarified that the jury\n\n13 had not yet reached a verdict on the murder count, but also clarified that it had not\n\n14 intended to acquit Defendant on that count when it submitted the completed voluntary\n\n15 manslaughter verdict form. At the end of the district court\u2019s inquiry Friday evening,\n\n16 no ambiguity remained. The district court had neither accepted a verdict on the murder\n\n17 count in open court, nor conducted a jury poll. As such, the jury had given no final\n\n\n\n          1\n18          We note that Defendant does not assert the district court erred by accepting the\n19 jury\u2019s verdict as to Counts 2 through 6 prior to completion of deliberations on all\n20 counts.\n\n                                                13\n\f 1 verdict and Defendant was not entitled to acquittal. When polled the following\n\n 2 Monday, after deliberations were concluded, the jury confirmed that it had found\n\n 3 Defendant guilty of second degree murder.\n\n 4   {15}   The unique facts of this case lead us to conclude that the jury\u2019s verdict was free\n\n 5 from coercion. Further, nothing in the record suggests that the verdict form on the\n\n 6 murder count submitted Friday evening represented an \u201cultimate expression of the\n\n 7 jury\u2019s verdict at the time of its discharge.\u201d See id. As a result, we affirm the jury\u2019s\n\n 8 final verdict convicting Defendant of second degree murder.\n\n 9 Confession\n\n10   {16}   Defendant next argues that because he qualifies as a youthful offender, he is\n\n11 entitled to the protections afforded by NMSA 1978, Section 32A-2-14(D) (2009),\n\n12 which requires the State to prove that Defendant\u2019s statements were \u201celicited only after\n\n13 a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver\u201d of his constitutional rights. Defendant\n\n14 asserts that the State did not meet its burden in this regard. We review de novo the\n\n15 district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts in denying a motion to suppress\n\n16 inculpatory statements. State v.

You also have a right to stop answering\n17          questions at any time until you have talked to a lawyer, family member\n18          or friend.\n\n19 There was a blank space after each sentence, in which Defendant signed his initials.\n\n20 Defendant also initialed to acknowledge each of the following waivers:\n\n21          I have read the statement of my rights shown above. I have also had my\n22          rights read and explained to me. I understand what my rights are. I am\n23          willing to answer questions and make a statement. I do not want a lawyer\n24          present. I do not want a family member or friend present. I understand\n25          and know what I am doing. No promises or threats of any kind have been\n26          made to me and no pressure of any kind has been used against me.\n\n\n\n                                                17\n\f 1   {20}   During the interview, Defendant appeared clean, rested, coherent, and alert.\n\n 2 Defendant acted in a calm and polite manner toward the interviewing officers,\n\n 3 articulating and communicating clearly. Defendant gave no indication that he was\n\n 4 uneducated or confused by the questions being posed to him. Though Defendant\u2019s\n\n 5 parents were present in the building at the time of the interview, Defendant was not\n\n 6 informed of their presence; and, while his parents were not with Defendant during the\n\n 7 interview, he was advised that he could have them present if he wanted.\n\n 8   {21}   The next day, June 11, 2011, the officers interviewed Defendant, again doing\n\n 9 so in the afternoon. That interview took place in a room containing a table with chairs\n\n10 on both sides. The officers began the interview by asking Defendant whether an\n\n11 attorney had been assigned to him, to which Defendant answered no. Though\n\n12 Defendant did not fill out an additional waiver form, the officer went over the rights\n\n13 from the waiver the day before and asked whether Defendant remembered that he had\n\n14 those rights; Defendant responded that he remembered, and he agreed to speak with\n\n15 the officers. Defendant was not in handcuffs for this interview. Defendant\u2019s demeanor\n\n16 was similar to the day before, and he was composed, cooperative, and polite. Again,\n\n17 the officer did not observe anything unusual in Defendant\u2019s behavior or demeanor.\n\n18   {22}   Prior to trial, Defendant filed a motion to suppress inculpatory statements that\n\n19 he gave to the police during these interviews. The State\u2019s response clarified that it was\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\f 1 only seeking to introduce statements Defendant made after he was adequately advised\n\n 2 of his rights, and it included digital recordings of Defendant\u2019s interviews. The district\n\n 3 court held a hearing on the motion, during which the State offered the testimony of the\n\n 4 officer involved in Defendant\u2019s interviews. The State also offered evidence that\n\n 5 Defendant previously had his rights explained to him in an unrelated matter seven\n\n 6 months earlier. In that instance, Defendant had a similar form read and explained to\n\n 7 him, and he signed and initialed that form, waiving his rights. There was no indication\n\n 8 or assertion that Defendant did not understand his rights or the implications of his\n\n 9 waiver on that occasion either.\n\n10   {23}   Defense counsel then called Maxann Shwartz, a licensed clinical psychologist,\n\n11 to testify regarding the voluntariness of Defendant\u2019s waiver. Shwartz testified that\n\n12 Defendant was slower to develop than his peers because he had been neglected when\n\n13 he was younger. She also noted that English was not Defendant\u2019s first language, and\n\n14 that any language difficulties Defendant had would be made worse when he was under\n\n15 stress. Shwartz characterized Defendant as suffering from reactive attachment\n\n16 disorder, which led Defendant to develop personality styles to please others; she\n\n17 explained that in order to avoid difficulties, Defendant would avoid asking for things\n\n18 and making his needs known. The best way for Defendant to have his rights explained\n\n19 to him, according to Shwartz, would be through a slow, piece-by-piece explanation.\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f 1 Shwartz concluded that Defendant was unable to assert his rights during the June\n\n 2 interviews. Shwartz explained that Defendant was likely unable to comprehend the\n\n 3 significance of his decision to waive his rights because he was functioning \u201clike a\n\n 4 child\u2014a seven-year-old.\u201d Shwartz also testified, however, that Defendant was \u201cpretty\n\n 5 bright\u201d intellectually and that he did well in school. She agreed with the State on cross\n\n 6 examination that, after reviewing the recordings of Defendant\u2019s statements to police,\n\n 7 nothing in Defendant\u2019s behavior was unusual or would have indicated to the officers\n\n 8 that he had any sort of impairment; according to Shwartz, \u201cthey would have no idea.\u201d\n\n 9   {24}   The district court, after considering the parties\u2019 arguments and listening to the\n\n10 recordings of the interviews, issued an order denying Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress\n\n11 his inculpatory statements. The district court found that at the time of the interview,\n\n12 Defendant was seventeen years old, had completed the eleventh grade, and made good\n\n13 grades in school. It acknowledged that Defendant was in custody during both\n\n14 interviews and found the officer\u2019s testimony regarding the location, conditions, and\n\n15 length of the interviews to be credible. Regarding the waiver of Defendant\u2019s rights,\n\n16 the district court found that Defendant \u201cwas properly advised of his rights\n\n17 immediately prior to the first interview and initialed and signed a written rights\n\n18 waiver.\u201d It also took note of the fact that Defendant had undergone questioning on an\n\n19 unrelated matter approximately six months earlier, had his rights explained to him,\n\n\n\n                                               20\n\f 1 and waived his rights in that interview as well. The district court pointed out that,\n\n 2 though Defendant may have been suffering from a lack of sleep, there was \u201cnothing\n\n 3 unusual about the mental or physical condition of [D]efendant at the time of the\n\n 4 questioning[, . . . and] he appeared clean, rested, calm, polite and articulate.\u201d The\n\n 5 district court also found that while Defendant did not have the counsel of an attorney,\n\n 6 friend, or relative at the time of questioning, he had spoken with his parents between\n\n 7 the first and second interview.\n\n 8   {25}   Having considered and made findings regarding each of the factors listed in\n\n 9 Section 32A-2-14(E), the district court turned to case law and the testimony of\n\n10 Shwartz. Noting the broad implications of Defendant\u2019s argument, the district court\n\n11 declined to apply a rule requiring officers to \u201cquiz the suspect to confirm an in-depth\n\n12 understanding of the waiver[,]\u201d and characterized such a rule as \u201cburdensome and\n\n13 onerous[.]\u201d The district court also specifically declined to adopt Shwartz\u2019s testimony\n\n14 because it believed that following Shwartz\u2019s opinions would lead to the result that \u201cno\n\n15 juvenile could ever validly waive Miranda rights.\u201d As a result, the district court\n\n16 concluded that the State proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant\u2019s\n\n17 waiver was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily given.\n\n18   {26}   On appeal, rather than explicitly challenging the district court\u2019s findings,\n\n19 Defendant asserts that the district court should have considered Shwartz\u2019s testimony\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\f 1 regarding frontal lobe development in children and its impact on a child\u2019s ability to\n\n 2 make a knowing and intelligent waiver in its assessment of the totality of\n\n 3 circumstances. Defendant also does not explicitly challenge the district court\u2019s ruling\n\n 4 on the basis that it did not consider all eight factors enumerated in Section 32A-2-\n\n 5 14(E), instead, arguing that the district court erred in refusing to consider Shwartz\u2019s\n\n 6 testimony that Defendant was unable to assert or comprehend his rights at the time of\n\n 7 questioning.\n\n 8   {27}   The district court was free to weigh the testimony and determine Shwartz\u2019s\n\n 9 credibility in making its factual findings.

Furthermore, the district court found Shwartz\u2019s conclusions\n\n 5 unpersuasive in light of evidence regarding Defendant\u2019s behavior during two\n\n 6 interviews and his performance during a preliminary hearing. The district court\u2019s\n\n 7 findings in this case were supported by the evidence, and it did not err in rejecting\n\n 8 Shwartz\u2019s testimony.\n\n 9   {28}   Defendant also acknowledges that the district court considered each of the eight\n\n10 factors listed in Section 32A-2-14(E), but complains that its consideration of those\n\n11 factors was nominal. We are unpersuaded. Of the eight factors, only the last\n\n12 one\u2014whether Defendant had counsel of an attorney, friends or relatives at the time\n\n13 of questioning\u2013weighs in Defendant\u2019s favor. That single factor is not sufficient to\n\n14 overcome all of the other circumstances supporting the knowing, intelligent, and\n\n15 voluntary waiver of his rights, including that Defendant was almost eighteen, was\n\n16 intelligent, was not handcuffed during the interviews, and was questioned during the\n\n17 afternoon for short periods of time with breaks in between in an appropriate\n\n18 environment while he was clean and rested, and in a coherent and alert state of mind.\n\n19 Furthermore, the district court also considered in its analysis of the totality of\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\f 1 circumstances, Defendant\u2019s demeanor during pretrial hearings and the fact that the\n\n 2 same rights had been explained to him a few months earlier without any challenge to\n\n 3 the validity of waiver. We agree with the district court\u2019s determination that, based on\n\n 4 the evidence presented during the suppression hearing and the totality of\n\n 5 circumstances, Defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\n\n 6 Sentence\n\n 7   {29}   Because Defendant was a minor when the incident occurred, the district court\n\n 8 held an amenability hearing following his conviction and prior to sentencing in\n\n 9 accordance with NMSA 1978, \u00a7 32A-2-20(A) (2009). The district court found by\n\n10 clear and convincing evidence that Defendant was not amenable to treatment and not\n\n11 eligible for commitment to an institution for children. The district court subsequently\n\n12 sentenced Defendant, as an adult, to thirty-three years of incarceration, followed by\n\n13 two years of parole.\n\n14   {30}   Defendant argues that he cannot be sentenced as an adult for the delinquency\n\n15 offenses; and, because he was adjudicated guilty of both delinquency offenses and\n\n16 youthful offender offenses, he asks that we vacate his convictions for the delinquency\n\n17 offenses.

NMSA 1978,\n\n10 \u00a7 32A-2-3(A), (B) (2009). A child is characterized as a youthful offender if he is a\n\n11 delinquent child who is fourteen to eighteen years of age when he commits at least one\n\n12 of thirteen offenses enumerated in the Act, including second degree murder and\n\n13 aggravated burglary. Section 32A-2-3(J)(1).\n\n14   {32}   The district court sentenced Defendant to fifteen years incarceration for second\n\n15 degree murder\u2014a lesser included offense to first degree murder charged in Count 1\n\n16 of Defendant\u2019s indictment\u2014and nine years for aggravated burglary. The remaining\n\n17 four felony convictions earned Defendant an additional nine years. An adjudication\n\n18 for second degree murder and aggravated burglary elevates a delinquent child to a\n\n19 youthful offender under the definitions set forth in Section 32A-2-3(J), while the\n\n\n\n                                               25\n\f 1 remaining offenses are delinquent acts under the statute. Section 32A-2-3(A). Under\n\n 2 Section 32A-2-20(A), the district court has the discretion to sentence a youthful\n\n 3 offender as either an adult or juvenile. \u201cIf the court invokes an adult sentence, the\n\n 4 court may sentence the child to less than, but shall not exceed, the mandatory adult\n\n 5 sentence.\u201d Section 32A-2-20(E).\n\n 6   {33}   In State v. Montano, 1995-NMCA-065, \u00b6 7, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158414\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158414/state-v-montano/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158414\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158414/state-v-montano/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we\n\n 7 recognized that a conviction for a delinquent act may result in an adult sentence where\n\n 8 the defendant is also convicted and sentenced as an adult for a youthful offender\n\n 9 offense. There, the defendant was convicted of two crimes: one that the statute\n\n10 enumerated as a delinquent offense, and one that the statute enumerated as a youthful\n\n11 offender offense. Id. \u00b6 4. After being sentenced as an adult for both offenses, the\n\n12 defendant appealed, arguing that the court lacked authority to sentence him as an adult\n\n13 for the delinquent offense. Id. \u00b6 5. Looking to case law, we noted that\n\n14 jurisdiction\u2014both personal and subject matter\u2014transfers from children\u2019s court to\n\n15 district court where a juvenile is to be prosecuted as an adult. Id. \u00b6 7; see also \u00a7 32A-\n\n16 2-20(E) (noting that invoking an adult sentence \u201cterminates the jurisdiction of the\n\n17 court over the child with respect to the delinquent acts alleged in the petition\u201d).\n\n18 Montano emphasized that an anomaly existed in allowing both the district court and\n\n19 the children\u2019s court to have jurisdiction over a youthful offender so that a defendant\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\f 1 \u201cwould be subject to rehabilitation as a juvenile, while at the same time he could be\n\n 2 sentenced to prison as an adult offender.\u201d 1995-NMCA-065, \u00b6 5 (internal quotation\n\n 3 marks and citation omitted). Though acknowledging the \u201ctheoretical possibilities\u201d of\n\n 4 a dual sentencing scheme where a court could sentence someone both as an adult and\n\n 5 as a juvenile, Montano ultimately rejected such a scheme, reasoning that it \u201cfail[s] to\n\n 6 address the anomaly of sentencing a defendant to be rehabilitated as a juvenile when\n\n 7 there has been a determination that the defendant cannot be rehabilitated in available\n\n 8 juvenile facilities.\u201d Id. \u00b6 6. We then looked to the statute, noting our obligation to\n\n 9 avoid unreasonable interpretations and applications of its language. Seeing no\n\n10 ambiguity in the statute\u2019s language that would warrant an in-depth analysis of that\n\n11 language, we concluded that, \u201c[b]ased on the statutory scheme and caselaw\n\n12 concerning the transfer of juveniles to district court,\u201d the Legislature intended any\n\n13 juvenile adjudicated for a youthful offender offense \u201cto be subject to adult sanctions\n\n14 under Section 32A-2-20 for any offense in the same case.\u201d Montano, 1995-NMCA-\n\n15 065, \u00b6 7 (emphasis in original). As a result, we affirmed the defendant\u2019s adult sentence\n\n16 for an offense enumerated as a delinquent act under the statute.\n\n17   {34}   Montano guides our analysis in this instance. Though Montano dealt with a\n\n18 previous version of this statute, the relevant language remains the same. Defendant\u2019s\n\n19 convictions for second degree murder and aggravated burglary are clearly youthful\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\f 1 offender offenses under the statute. See \u00a7 32A-2-3. The statute provides the district\n\n 2 court with discretion to sentence Defendant as an adult. See \u00a7 32A-2-20(A). Indeed,\n\n 3 Defendant neither argues that he was improperly sentenced as an adult for the second\n\n 4 degree murder and aggravated burglary charges, nor asserts that he was improperly\n\n 5 characterized as a youthful offender. According to Montano, if the district court\n\n 6 properly sentenced Defendant as an adult for the youthful offender offenses, then it\n\n 7 could properly sentence Defendant as an adult for the remaining offenses. By\n\n 8 acknowledging the propriety of his sentence for the youthful offender counts,\n\n 9 Defendant has failed to demonstrate the district court erred in sentencing him as an\n\n10 adult for the remaining delinquency counts.\n\n11   {35}   To the extent that Defendant cites to Muniz and Jones, as support for his\n\n12 position, we are unpersuaded. Muniz and Jones are distinguishable, as they dealt with\n\n13 the district court\u2019s authority to impose an adult sentence based on a serious youthful\n\n14 offender charge that had been dropped\u2014either as a result of plea negotiations or the\n\n15 prosecutor\u2019s discretion. See \u00a7 32A-2-3(H) (defining \u201cserious youthful offender\u201d as \u201can\n\n16 individual fifteen to eighteen years of age who is charged with and indicted . . . for\n\n17 first degree murder\u201d). In addition, the Legislature \u201clargely abrogated\u201d Muniz by\n\n18 amending Section 32A-2-20 in 2005, while Jones focused on whether an amenability\n\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\f1 hearing was required under Section 32A-2-20(B).
