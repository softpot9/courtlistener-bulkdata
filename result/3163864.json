According to an\n 3   increasing number of courts, including some courts of appeal, the\n 4   answer is: when the tax return, otherwise wholly compliant with\n 5   applicable tax laws, is filed a second (or more) late.    According\n 6   to these courts, by way of the 2005 Bankruptcy Code amendments,\n 7   Congress intended to make a substantial and exceptionally harsh\n 8   change to nondischargeability law by adding a hanging paragraph\n 9   at the end of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)1 defining the term \u201creturn\u201d to\n10   exclude any taxpayer filing that does not wholly and strictly\n11   comply with all applicable return filing requirements, even if\n12   the taxing authority itself could and would forgive that\n13   noncompliance.   Indeed, the United States rejects this statutory\n14   interpretation in this appeal.\n15        The courts adopting a literal construction of the \u201creturn\u201d\n16   definition more or less admit that their unforgiving view of\n17   congressional intent cannot be squared within the context of\n18   \u00a7 523(a), or even within the narrower context of the hanging\n19   paragraph itself, without running into some significant\n20   conundrums.   The second sentence of the hanging paragraph\n21   expressly includes within the definition of \u201creturn\u201d some types\n22   of returns that the taxing authority prepares on behalf of the\n23   taxpayer, when the taxpayer never gets around to it.   Why\n24   Congress would want to treat a taxpayer who files a tax return a\n25\n          1\n26         Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section\n     references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-1532, and\n27   all \"Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n     Procedure, Rules 1001-9037. All \u201cCivil Rule\u201d references are to\n28   the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n                                      2\n\f 1   month or a week or even a day late \u2013 possibly for reasons beyond\n 2   his or her control \u2013 so much more harshly than a taxpayer who\n 3   never files a tax return on his or her own behalf is a mystery\n 4   that literal construction adherents never adequately explain.\n 5   Nor have they adequately explained why, later on in the second\n 6   sentence of the hanging paragraph, Congress felt a need to\n 7   explicitly exclude from the \u201creturn\u201d definition another type of\n 8   return filed by taxing authorities on behalf of taxpayers when\n 9   that exclusion is superfluous if one accepts a literal\n10   construction of the first sentence of the hanging paragraph.\n11        When one looks beyond the hanging paragraph, at the context\n12   of the nondischargeability statute as a whole and Congress\u2019\n13   scheme for nondischargeable debts, one encounters additional,\n14   even-more-serious problems with the literal construction of the\n15   \u201creturn\u201d definition.   Section 523(a)(1)(B)(ii), which pre-existed\n16   the 2005 amendments, already contains a specific and carefully-\n17   balanced treatment of tax debts associated with untimely-filed\n18   tax returns.   Literal construction of the \u201creturn\u201d definition\n19   renders \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) all but meaningless - reducing the\n20   potential application of that provision to a minuscule scope.\n21   And, according to the literal construction adherents, Congress\n22   intended the \u201creturn\u201d definition to accomplish this dramatic re-\n23   balancing of the dischargeability of tax debt without a single\n24   legislative comment to that effect.\n25        In light of these concerns arising from a contextual reading\n26   of the hanging paragraph, we reject the literal construction of\n27   the \u201creturn\u201d definition.   We further conclude that there is\n28   binding Ninth Circuit authority predating the 2005 amendments\n\n                                      3\n\f 1   instructing us how to determine when a taxpayer filing should be\n 2   treated as a return for nondischargeability purposes and that\n 3   authority was not abrogated by the 2005 amendments.\n 4        The bankruptcy court erred because it declined to apply the\n 5   existing Ninth Circuit test as to what constitutes a \u201creturn,\u201d so\n 6   we VACATE the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling declaring the Martins\u2019\n 7   tax debt dischargeable, and we REMAND so that the bankruptcy\n 8   court can apply the Ninth Circuit test.\n 9                                    FACTS\n10        The facts are undisputed.    The Martins did not file their\n11   tax returns for 2004, 2005 and 2006 at the time they were due.\n12   Consequently, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) conducted an\n13   audit examination beginning in June 2008 to fix the amount of the\n14   Martins\u2019 tax liability for those three years.       Without the\n15   benefit of the Martins\u2019 self-reported income tax data in the form\n16   of tax returns, the IRS duly followed the deficiency and\n17   assessment procedures set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.\n18   See 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 6201, et seq.    In August 2008, following the\n19   completion of the audit examination, the IRS issued a notice of\n20   deficiency for each of the three tax years.\n21        The Martins did not respond to the notices of deficiency,\n22   but the notices did spur the Martins to hire a new accountant to\n23   prepare the missing tax returns.       In December 2008, the\n24   accountant signed and completed the Martins\u2019 tax returns for\n25   2004, 2005 and 2006, but the Martins did not get around to\n26   signing and filing the tax returns until six months later in June\n27   2009.   There is no evidence explaining the reason for the\n28   Martins\u2019 several-year delay in preparing their 2004, 2005 and\n\n                                        4\n\f 1   2006 tax returns, nor is there any evidence explaining the\n 2   Martins\u2019 delay in signing and filing the completed returns.2\n 3\n          2\n 4         While it does not constitute evidence in the strict sense,\n     at the summary judgment oral argument, the Martins attempted to\n 5   explain the delays. With respect to their initial failure to\n     timely prepare their 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax returns, Ms. Martin\n 6   stated:\n 7        [W]e had problems with our previous accountant. Her\n 8        husband died and she had to let us go and -- and so she\n          -- basically we were trying to -- she had her assistant\n 9        try to finish us up. And she got sick and held on to\n          our taxes for over a year. And we repeatedly tried to\n10        get them back from her, and she kept saying she was\n          going to finish them.\n11\n12        And then by the time we realized -- finally we\n          demanded them back, and we had to find a new accountant\n13        who had to start fresh. And that was Andrea, and\n          that's when she started reassessing and doing all our\n14        taxes to help get us caught up.\n15\n     Hr\u2019g Tr. (Aug. 29, 2013) at 6:4-15. With respect to the six-\n16   month delay in signing and filing the completed returns, the\n     bankruptcy court and Ms. Martin engaged in the following\n17   colloquy:\n18        THE COURT: Why didn't the tax returns get filed [six]\n19        months earlier, when the accountant signed them?\n\n20        SUSAN MARTIN: Because she actually finished them on\n          12-18-08. And I believe we were waiting for two other\n21        years that were behind, '07 and '08, to be completed\n          before we put them all in together.\n22\n23        THE COURT: Why?   Why.   Why didn't -- why didn't --\n\n24        SUSAN MARTIN: I don't know. I -- I just feel like we\n          were trying to get it all in at once. I -- I guess\n25        that's why we waited. I was wondering the same thing,\n26        why we didn't get them in right away. But we had so\n          many back taxes that we were just trying to get them\n27        all done. And that's why they sat for a little while.\n\n28                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                       5\n\f 1        Meanwhile, having not heard from the Martins, the IRS made\n 2   assessments against the Martins for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax\n 3   years in March 2009.     Thereafter, the IRS twice sent the Martins\n 4   notices of the unpaid taxes and demands for payment \u2013 once in\n 5   March 2009 and another time in April 2009.       The IRS then gave the\n 6   Martins notice of its intent to collect the assessed taxes by\n 7   levy.\n 8        Only after the IRS threatened to collect the unpaid taxes\n 9   did the Martins finally file their 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax\n10   returns.     The IRS accepted the untimely returns and adjusted the\n11   Martins\u2019 tax liability based on the information set forth in the\n12   returns.     The IRS adjusted their 2004 tax liability downward by\n13   roughly $1,000 (from $18,432 to $17,358), their 2005 tax\n14   liability upward by roughly $5,000 (from $9,928 to $14,852), and\n15   their 2006 tax liability downward by roughly $5,000 (from $32,133\n16   to $27,010).\n17        The Martins commenced their chapter 7 bankruptcy case in\n18   November 2011 and commenced pro se the adversary proceeding from\n19   which this appeal arises in July 2012.       By way of their\n20   complaint, they sought a determination that their 2004, 2005 and\n21   2006 tax debt was dischargeable.       The IRS responded to the\n22   complaint by alleging that the subject tax debt was\n23   nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i), as a tax debt for\n24   which a tax return was required but never filed.3\n25\n          2\n26         (...continued)\n     Hr\u2019g Tr. (Aug. 29, 2013) at 5:7-19.\n27\n          3\n              Ultimately, the IRS conceded the dischargeability of the\n28                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                        6\n\f 1        The IRS filed a summary judgment motion based on the\n 2   undisputed facts.   The bankruptcy court denied the IRS\u2019s summary\n 3   judgment motion and instead, on the undisputed facts, granted\n 4   judgment in favor of the Martins.    In a thoughtful, thorough and\n 5   detailed memorandum of decision, the bankruptcy court rejected\n 6   the IRS\u2019s legal theories attempting to explain why a tax return\n 7   filed post-assessment is the functional equivalent of no tax\n 8   return at all for both tax purposes and nondischargeability\n 9   purposes.\n10        The bankruptcy court also grappled with the meaning of the\n11   word \u201creturn\u201d for purposes of the nondischargeability statute,\n12   both before and after the 2005 Bankruptcy Code amendments.\n13   Ultimately, the bankruptcy court held that the correct standard\n14   for determining whether a taxpayer filing qualified as a return\n15   for purposes of the nondischargeability statute had not changed\n16   as a result of the 2005 amendments.   According to the bankruptcy\n17   court, the test established in the tax court decision of Beard v.\n18   Commissioner, 82 T.C. 766, 774\u201379 (1984), aff'd 793 F.2d 139 (6th\n19   Cir. 1986), should be used to determine whether the debtor\n20   taxpayer had filed a return.   The Beard test as articulated in\n21   Ninth Circuit authority requires courts to consider the following\n22   factors:\n23        (1) it must purport to be a return; (2) it must be\n          executed under penalty of perjury; (3) it must contain\n24        sufficient data to allow calculation of tax; and (4) it\n          must represent an honest and reasonable attempt to\n25\n26        3\n           (...continued)\n27   additional amount assessed for 2005 based on the Martins\u2019 2005\n     tax return. Nor did it contest the dischargeability of the\n28   penalties it assessed and the interest accrued on the penalties.\n\n                                      7\n\f 1        satisfy the requirements of the tax law.\n 2   United States v. Hatton (In re Hatton), 220 F.3d 1057, 1060\u201361\n 3   (9th Cir. 2000) (\u201cHatton II\u201d) (citing United States v. Hindenlang\n 4   (In re Hindenlang), 164 F.3d 1029, 1033 (6th Cir. 1999)).\n 5        Instead of utilizing the version of the Beard test as\n 6   applied in Hatton II and In re Hindenlang, the bankruptcy court\n 7   utilized a slightly different version of the Beard test.    Whereas\n 8   the honest-and reasonable inquiry in the Hatton/Hindenlang\n 9   version is broad in scope and at least partially subjective in\n10   focus, the honest-and-reasonable inquiry in the version of the\n11   Beard test utilized by the bankruptcy court was narrow in scope\n12   and exclusively objective in focus.   The bankruptcy court only\n13   considered the face of the Martins\u2019 tax filings and looked at the\n14   form and content of those filings in order to determine, from an\n15   objective standpoint, that the Martins\u2019 filings for the 2004,\n16   2005 and 2006 tax years constituted \u201can honest and reasonable\n17   attempt to satisfy the requirements of the tax law.\u201d\n18        The bankruptcy court concluded that the Martins\u2019 2004, 2005\n19   and 2006 tax filings qualified as returns for nondischargeability\n20   purposes and granted judgment in their favor on that basis.   The\n21   IRS timely filed its notice of appeal on April 14, 2014.\n22                             JURISDICTION\n23        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n24   \u00a7\u00a7 1334 and 157(b)(2)(I), and we have jurisdiction under\n25   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158.\n26                                 ISSUE\n27        Did the bankruptcy court apply the correct legal standard\n28   for determining whether the Martins\u2019 tax filings qualified as tax\n\n                                     8\n\f 1   returns for purposes of the nondischargeability statute?\n 2                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n 3        This appeal presents a question of statutory construction,\n 4   which is a question of law we review de novo.    Samson v. W.\n 5   Capital Partners, LLC (In re Blixseth), 684 F.3d 865, 869 (9th\n 6   Cir. 2012) (per curiam).\n 7                                 DISCUSSION\n 8   A.   The Parties\u2019 Positions\n 9        In this appeal, the IRS has advocated two distinct\n10   positions: an official, preferred position and an unofficial,\n11   fall-back position.    Officially, the IRS contends that the\n12   dischargeability of income tax debt associated with a late-filed\n13   tax return should hinge on whether the taxpayer filed the return\n14   before or after the IRS made any assessment.    This position is\n15   not new for the IRS.    See, e.g., Mallo v. I.R.S. (In re Mallo),\n16   774 F.3d 1313, 1325-27 (10th Cir. 2014); Wogoman v. I.R.S.\n17   (In re Wogoman), 475 B.R. 239, 250 (10th Cir. BAP 2012); see also\n18   IRS Chief Counsel Notice CC\u20132010\u2013016, available at 2010 WL\n19   3617597.\n20        Alternately and unofficially, the IRS contends that the\n21   Ninth Circuit\u2019s version of the Beard test is sufficient to\n22   accomplish its litigation goal in this appeal.    According to the\n23   IRS, if the bankruptcy court here had applied the Ninth Circuit\n24   version of the Beard test, it should have and would have\n25   concluded that the Martins\u2019 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax returns do\n26   not qualify as returns for nondischargeability purposes.\n27        The Martins similarly contend that the Beard test applies,\n28   but they insist that the bankruptcy court correctly determined\n\n                                       9\n\f 1   under the Beard test that their 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax returns\n 2   qualify as returns for nondischargeability purposes.\n 3         Notably, neither side here advocates in favor of the literal\n 4   construction of the \u201creturn\u201d definition that Congress added to\n 5   the nondischargeability statute as part of the 2005 Bankruptcy\n 6   Code amendments.    Indeed, in this case and in other cases, the\n 7   IRS expressly has rejected the literal construction and has\n 8   stated that the literal construction leads to \u201coverly harsh\u201d\n 9   results.    In re Wogoman, 475 B.R. at 250.   Instead, the IRS has\n10   advocated for its less draconian approach focusing on whether the\n11   taxpayer filing occurred before or after an IRS tax assessment.\n12   Id.\n13         Even though neither side here supports the literal\n14   construction of the \u201creturn\u201d definition, in light of the\n15   increasing number of courts that have adopted that construction,\n16   our analysis necessarily focuses on that approach first.    Before\n17   undertaking that analysis, however, we first describe the legal\n18   state of affairs in the Ninth Circuit before Congress added the\n19   \u201creturn\u201d definition to the nondischargeability statute.\n20   B.    The Ninth Circuit Legal Landscape Before BAPCPA4\n21         Section 523(a)(1)(B)(i) excepts from discharge tax debt when\n22   the debtor taxpayer was required to file a tax return but did not\n23   do so.    Cal. Franchise Tax Bd. v. Jackson (In re Jackson),\n24   184 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir. 1999).    \u201cThe policy behind this\n25   subsection is that a debtor should not be permitted to discharge\n26\n27\n           4\n           The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection\n28   Act, Pub.L. No. 109\u20138, 119 Stat. 23 (2005) (\u201cBAPCPA\u201d).\n\n                                      10\n\f 1   a tax liability based upon a required tax return that was never\n 2   filed.\u201d   Id. at 1052 (citing 3 NORTON BANKRUPTCY LAW AND PRACTICE 2d\n 3   \u00a7 47:6, 47\u201315 (1997)).    Meanwhile, \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) excepts\n 4   from discharge tax debt associated with untimely filed tax\n 5   returns filed within two years of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy filing,\n 6   and \u00a7 523(a)(1)(C) excepts from discharge tax debt associated\n 7   with tax returns that are fraudulent or evasive.       See\n 8   In re Hindenlang, 164 F.3d at 1032; see also 4 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY\n 9   \u00b6 523.07[3],[4] (Alan N. Resnick & Henry J. Sommer, eds., 16th\n10   ed. rev. 2015).\n11        In United States v. Hatton (In re Hatton) (\u201cHatton I\u201d),\n12   216 B.R. 278, 282 (9th Cir. BAP 1997), this Panel adopted for\n13   purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i) the meaning of \u201creturn\u201d set forth\n14   in Beard.   Beard held that a document qualifies as a return if:\n15        (1) it must purport to be a return; (2) it must be\n          executed under penalty of perjury; (3) it must contain\n16        sufficient data to allow calculation of tax; and (4) it\n          must represent an honest and reasonable attempt to\n17        satisfy the requirements of the tax law.\n18   In re Hindenlang, 164 F.3d at 1033.     Hatton I applied the Beard\n19   test in upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the debtor\n20   had filed a return within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i).\n21   Hatton I reasoned that the debtor taxpayer came close enough to\n22   filing a return by meeting with the IRS, by acquiescing to the\n23   substitute return the IRS filed on the debtor taxpayer\u2019s behalf,\n24   by acknowledging his liability for 1983 taxes in the amount set\n25   forth in the substitute return, and by entering into an\n26   installment payment agreement, pursuant to which debtor agreed to\n27   pay his delinquent taxes at a rate of $200 per month.\n28        The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.       Hatton II,\n\n                                       11\n\f 1   220 F.3d at 1060\u201361.   Hatton II rejected Hatton I\u2019s attempted\n 2   expansion of the Beard test to include a debtor taxpayer who had\n 3   not signed any document under penalty of perjury and who \u201cmade\n 4   every attempt to avoid paying his taxes\u201d until the IRS sent the\n 5   debtor taxpayer a letter threatening to levy on his wages and\n 6   bank accounts and to seize his property.   Id. at 1061.   But\n 7   Hatton II did not throw out the baby with the bath water.    For\n 8   purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i), Hatton II explicitly adopted\n 9   Beard\u2019s definition of return, as articulated in\n10   In re Hindenlang.5\n11        By adopting In re Hindenlang\u2019s version of the Beard test,\n12   Hatton II sub silentio overruled, at least in part, another Panel\n13   decision \u2013 United States v. Nunez (In re Nunez), 232 B.R. 778,\n14   783 (9th Cir. BAP 1999).   In re Nunez adopted a slightly\n15\n16\n          5\n           There is nothing in Hatton II suggesting that it adopted\n17   other aspects of In re Hindenlang, particularly\n     In re Hindenlang\u2019s holding that post-assessment tax returns filed\n18   by the taxpayer never qualify as returns for purposes of\n19   \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B). To the contrary, Hatton II\u2019s analysis \u2013\n     especially its reliance on the Beard test to determine whether\n20   the taxpayer filed a return \u2013 is inconsistent with\n     In re Hindenlang\u2019s pre- or post-assessment test. As stated in\n21   one persuasive bankruptcy court decision:\n22\n          Had the Hatton court adopted the Hindenlang [pre- or\n23        post-assessment] Rule, it would not have needed to\n          consider whether the Debtor had executed the\n24        submissions under penalty of perjury or the Debtor's\n          subjective intent post assessment. The court would\n25        have simply determined that the debtor's post\n26        assessment submissions, could not as a matter of law,\n          constitute returns under \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B).\n27\n     Rushing v. United States (In re Rushing), 273 B.R. 223, 227\n28   (Bankr. D. Ariz. 2001).\n\n                                     12\n\f 1   different version of the Beard test.      Following Savage v. I.R.S.\n 2   (In re Savage), 218 B.R. 126, 132 (10th Cir. BAP 1998),\n 3   In re Nunez narrowed the honesty-and-reasonableness prong of the\n 4   Beard test to examine only what appeared on the face of the\n 5   taxpayer\u2019s filing in order to ascertain whether that filing\n 6   constituted \u201can honest and genuine endeavor to satisfy the law.\u201d\n 7   In re Nunez, 232 B.R. at 783 (quoting In re Savage, 218 B.R. at\n 8   132).    In re Nunez, therefore, excluded from its honesty-and-\n 9   reasonableness analysis the length of the delay in the taxpayer\u2019s\n10   filing, the reason for the delay and the number of tax years for\n11   which timely filings were missed.      Id.   It is impossible to\n12   reconcile this aspect of In re Nunez with Hatton II\u2019s honesty-\n13   and-reasonableness analysis, which largely hinged on the delay in\n14   taxpayer compliance.    See Hatton II, 220 F.3d at 1061.\n15        In short, in the Ninth Circuit, the Hatton II/\n16   In re Hindenlang version of the Beard test indisputably governed\n17   the definition of the term \u201creturn\u201d for purposes of determining\n18   the nondischargeability of tax debts, at least until the\n19   enactment of BAPCPA.    In the next section, we attempt to discern\n20   how (if at all) BAPCPA changed the legal landscape.\n21   C.   The Impact of BAPCPA on the Nondischargeability of Tax Debts\n22           Recall that, when Congress first enacted the Bankruptcy\n23   Code in 1978, it specifically noted that \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)\n24   represented a careful balancing of the competing interests of the\n25   debtor, the taxing authority, and the debtor\u2019s other creditors.\n26   See Maryland v. Ciotti (In re Ciotti), 638 F.3d 276, 279 (4th\n27   Cir. 2011) (citing S.Rep. No. 95\u2013989, at 14 (1978), reprinted in\n28   1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5800)).    Congress further stated that\n\n                                       13\n\f 1   \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B) reflected its intent that \u201ctax claims which are\n 2   nondischargeable, despite a lack of priority, are those to whose\n 3   staleness the debtor contributed by some wrong-doing or serious\n 4   fault.\u201d   S.Rep. No. 95\u2013989, at 14 (1978), reprinted in 1978\n 5   U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5800 (emphasis added).\n 6        In contrast, when Congress enacted BAPCPA, it did not offer\n 7   any similarly specific statement of its legislative rationale for\n 8   adding a definition of \u201creturn\u201d into the Code\u2019s\n 9   nondischargeability statute.   In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1327.6\n10   But BAPCPA was accompanied by a general statement of legislative\n11   intent indicating that the 2005 amendments as a whole were\n12   motivated by four general factors:\n13        the \u201crecent escalation of consumer bankruptcy filings,\u201d\n          the \u201csignificant losses . . . associated with\n14        bankruptcy filings,\u201d the fact that the \u201cbankruptcy\n          system has loopholes and incentives that allow\n15\n16\n          6\n           Congress did explain the second sentence of the hanging\n17   paragraph, as follows:\n18        Income Tax Returns Prepared by Tax Authorities.\n19        Section 714 of the Act amends section 523(a) of the\n          Bankruptcy Code to provide that a return prepared\n20        pursuant to section 6020(a) of the Internal Revenue\n          Code, or similar State or local law, constitutes filing\n21        a return (and the debt can be discharged), but that a\n          return filed on behalf of a taxpayer pursuant to\n22\n          section 6020(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or\n23        similar State or local law, does not constitute filing\n          a return (and the debt cannot be discharged).\n24\n     H.R. REP. 109-31(I), at 103 (2005), reprinted in 2005\n25   U.S.C.C.A.N. 88, 167. It seems odd that Congress would bother to\n26   explain the relatively minuscule effect of the second sentence of\n     the hanging paragraph but not offer any legislative comment on\n27   the first sentence, which literal construction adherents claim\n     dramatically altered the nondischargeability of tax debt\n28   associated with untimely filed tax returns.\n\n                                     14\n\f 1        and\u2014sometimes\u2014even encourage opportunistic personal\n          filings and abuse,\u201d and \u201cthe fact that some bankruptcy\n 2        debtors are able to repay a significant portion of\n          their debts.\u201d\n 3\n 4   In re Ciotti, 638 F.3d at 279 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 109\u201331, at 3-5\n 5   (2005), reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 88, at 90\u201392).\n 6        In any event, BAPCPA added the \u201creturn\u201d definition into the\n 7   nondischargeability statute in a hanging paragraph tacked onto\n 8   the end of \u00a7 523(a) and often cited as \u00a7 523(a)(*).   The hanging\n 9   paragraph consists of two sentences, the first of which defines\n10   the term \u201creturn\u201d and the second of which further refines that\n11   definition by explicitly including a certain type of return\n12   prepared by the taxing authority on behalf of the taxpayer and by\n13   expressly excluding another.   The full text of the hanging\n14   paragraph provides as follows:\n15        For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201creturn\u201d\n          means a return that satisfies the requirements of\n16        applicable nonbankruptcy law (including applicable\n          filing requirements). Such term includes a return\n17        prepared pursuant to section 6020(a) of the Internal\n          Revenue Code of 1986, or similar State or local law, or\n18        a written stipulation to a judgment or a final order\n          entered by a nonbankruptcy tribunal, but does not\n19        include a return made pursuant to section 6020(b) of\n          the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or a similar State\n20        or local law.\n21   11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(*).\n22        A number of courts, including several Courts of Appeal, have\n23   addressed the issue of what the \u201creturn\u201d definition means, and\n24   many of them have held that the term \u201capplicable filing\n25   requirements\u201d is unambiguous and that the plain and ordinary\n26   meaning of the term necessarily includes time deadlines for\n27   filing returns as stated in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.\n28   \u00a7 6072(a), and/or in equivalent state statutes.   Therefore, these\n\n                                      15\n\f 1   literal construction courts have concluded that untimely returns\n 2   are not returns at all for purposes of the nondischargeability\n 3   statute.    See, e.g., Fahey v. Massachusetts Dep\u2019t of Revenue\n 4   (In re Fahey), 779 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2015); In re Mallo,\n 5   774 F.3d at 1321; McCoy v. Miss. State Tax Comm'n (In re McCoy),\n 6   666 F.3d 924, 928, 932 (5th Cir. 2012).\n 7        The literal construction adherents have not been deterred by\n 8   the perceived harshness resulting from their reading of the\n 9   statute.    They rely heavily (if not exclusively) on the plain\n10   language of the phrase \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d to\n11   conclude that Congress intended by way of the \u201creturn\u201d definition\n12   in the hanging paragraph to except from discharge the tax debts\n13   of all taxpayers whose tax returns do not strictly comply with\n14   all filing requirements \u2013 including time deadlines.    See, e.g.,\n15   In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 4-5; In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1321;\n16   In re McCoy, 666 F.3d at 932.    In doing so, they gloss over one\n17   of the most important rules of plain meaning statutory\n18   construction: that the meaning of a statutory term only is\n19   considered plain and unambiguous if the term is clearly\n20   understood in the context of the words surrounding it and in the\n21   context of the larger statutory scheme.\n22        The Supreme court reiterated the vital importance of\n23   contextual reading in Yates v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1074,\n24   1081-82 (2015).    Yates emphasized that the clarity of statutory\n25   language only can be measured in \u201cthe specific context in which\n26   that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as\n27   a whole.\u201d    Id. at 1081 (quoting Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.,\n28   519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997)).    While the Court\u2019s ruling in Yates was\n\n                                      16\n\f 1   a plurality decision, there was no controversy amongst the\n 2   Justices about the critical importance of contextual reading.    In\n 3   fact, the Yates dissent, in which four Justices joined, was even\n 4   more compelling on this point:\n 5        I agree with the plurality (really, who does not?) that\n          context matters in interpreting statutes. We do not\n 6        \u201cconstrue the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.\u201d\n          Rather, we interpret particular words \u201cin their context\n 7        and with a view to their place in the overall statutory\n          scheme.\u201d And sometimes that means, as the plurality\n 8        says, that the dictionary definition of a disputed term\n          cannot control.\n 9\n10   Id. at 1092 (Justice Kagan dissenting) (citations omitted).\n11        The more one considers the phrase \u201capplicable filing\n12   requirements\u201d in context, the more doubtful the literal\n13   construction becomes.   First, within the hanging paragraph\n14   itself, the second sentence does not square with the so-called\n15   ordinary meaning of the term \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d\n16   found in the first sentence.   The literal construction of\n17   \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d effectively excepts from\n18   discharge all taxes associated with untimely-filed returns, but\n19   the second sentence adds right back into the definition returns\n20   prepared by taxing authorities under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6020(a) or under\n21   equivalent state statutes.   That subsection provides:\n22        (a) Preparation of return by Secretary.--If any person\n          shall fail to make a return required by this title or\n23        by regulations prescribed thereunder, but shall consent\n          to disclose all information necessary for the\n24        preparation thereof, then, and in that case, the\n          Secretary may prepare such return, which, being signed\n25        by such person, may be received by the Secretary as the\n          return of such person.\n26\n27   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6020(a).    Thus, under the literal construction of the\n28   hanging paragraph, a debtor taxpayer who is one month or one day\n\n                                      17\n\f 1   or even one hour late in filing his or her return will have his\n 2   associated tax debt excepted from discharge, whereas a debtor\n 3   taxpayer who never bothers to file his or her own return can\n 4   discharge his or her associated tax debt if the IRS fortuitously\n 5   prepares a return on that person\u2019s behalf.\n 6        Why would Congress want to treat debtor taxpayers who do\n 7   nothing on their own to comply with their return filing\n 8   obligations so much better than debtor taxpayers who \u2013 perhaps\n 9   for reasons beyond their control \u2013 miss the filing deadline by as\n10   little as a day but then conscientiously complete and file their\n11   return?   The literal construction adherents have an answer to\n12   this question, but that answer is hardly persuasive.    The literal\n13   construction adherents speculate that Congress wanted to make\n14   available to the taxing authorities a \u201ccarrot\u201d they could offer\n15   to formerly uncooperative taxpayers to encourage their\n16   cooperation going forward.    In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 7;\n17   In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1324; In re McCoy, 666 F.3d at 931.\n18        This makes no sense.    The literal construction adherents\n19   admit (at least some of them do) that it is extremely rare for\n20   taxing authorities to engage in the expensive and time-consuming\n21   process of preparing tax returns on behalf of taxpayers.    See,\n22   e.g., In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 6-7.    More importantly, the\n23   literal construction of the \u201creturn\u201d definition in reality\n24   creates an incentive for impoverished taxpayers who already are\n25   late in filing one or more tax returns to further delay, with the\n26   hope that they would be some of the lucky few for whom the taxing\n27   authorities decide to prepare returns on the taxpayers\u2019 behalf\n28   (which then would enable them under the literal construction to\n\n                                      18\n\f 1   obtain a discharge of an otherwise nondischargeable tax debt).\n 2        When read with a literal construction, the disconnect\n 3   between the first and second sentences of the hanging paragraph\n 4   does not end there.    In the last part of the second sentence, the\n 5   hanging paragraph excludes from the definition of \u201creturn\u201d\n 6   returns prepared by taxing authorities under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6020(b)\n 7   or under equivalent state statutes.   That subsection provides in\n 8   relevant part:\n 9        (b) Execution of return by Secretary.--\n10             (1) Authority of Secretary to execute return.--If\n               any person fails to make any return required by\n11             any internal revenue law or regulation made\n               thereunder at the time prescribed therefor, or\n12             makes, willfully or otherwise, a false or\n               fraudulent return, the Secretary shall make such\n13             return from his own knowledge and from such\n               information as he can obtain through testimony or\n14             otherwise.\n15   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6020(b).    Thus, according to the literal construction\n16   adherents, even though the first sentence of the hanging\n17   paragraph already excludes all late-filed returns from the\n18   definition of \u201creturn,\u201d Congress felt it necessary (supposedly\n19   for the sake of clarity) to repeat one tiny aspect of this\n20   exclusion one sentence later \u2013 the exclusion with respect to \u00a7\n21   6020(b) returns, which by definition are untimely.   See, e.g., In\n22   re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 7;   In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1324.   Many\n23   literal construction adherents acknowledge that a statute should,\n24   if possible, be construed in a manner that avoids rendering any\n25   part of it redundant.   See, e.g., In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 6;\n26   In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1317.   Indeed, In re Fahey cites to\n27   TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001), which stated: \u201c[i]t\n28   is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute\n\n                                      19\n\f 1   ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be\n 2   prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous,\n 3   void, or insignificant.\u201d   Id. (citations and internal quotation\n 4   marks omitted and emphasis added).\n 5        The literal construction adherents offer little to explain\n 6   their acceptance of the redundancy created by their\n 7   interpretation of the hanging paragraph.   According to them,\n 8   Congress likely was redundant for the sake of clarity.   But this\n 9   explanation is wholly at odds with the cardinal principle of\n10   statutory construction referenced immediately above.\n11   Alternately, the literal construction adherents dismiss the\n12   redundancy as insignificant, especially in light of the plain\n13   meaning of the term \u201capplicable filing requirements.\u201d    See, e.g.,\n14   In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 7.   This reasoning not only is circular\n15   but also undermines a contextual reading of the statute.\n16        Assuming the literal construction of the term \u201capplicable\n17   filing requirements\u201d already has not collapsed under the weight\n18   of the contextual difficulties found within the hanging paragraph\n19   itself, another more-extreme level of difficulties awaits within\n20   \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii).   In that subparagraph, as originally enacted\n21   in 1978, Congress clearly excepted from discharge any and all tax\n22   debts associated with untimely filed returns that were filed\n23   within two years of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy petition filing.\n24   In re Ciotti, 638 F.3d at 279.   Before BAPCPA, there was no\n25   genuine dispute regarding the broad coverage of this\n26   subparagraph.   See id.   After BAPCPA, at least under the literal\n27   construction, the once-expansive coverage of this subparagraph\n28   has been dramatically reduced to an infinitesimal scope \u2013 a scope\n\n                                      20\n\f 1   bordering on and approaching zero.    As the literal construction\n 2   adherents would have it, this subparagraph post-BAPCPA only would\n 3   apply to \u00a7 6020(a) returns, since \u00a7 6020(a) returns are the only\n 4   type of untimely returns that fall within the definition of\n 5   \u201creturn\u201d under the literal construction.   See, e.g., In re Fahey,\n 6   779 F.3d at 6; In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1323-24.\n 7        Structurally, interpreting the definitional hanging\n 8   paragraph in a way that dramatically alters the coverage of\n 9   \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) is an excellent example of \u201cthe tail wagging\n10   the dog.\u201d   This structural concern is the least of our concerns.\n11   The literal construction also renders \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) all but\n12   meaningless.   The literal construction adherents explain away\n13   this concern by suggesting that, while \u201cmeaningless\u201d is not okay\n14   under the cardinal rule disfavoring interpretations that render\n15   part of a statute superfluous, \u201call but meaningless\u201d is fine.\n16   See, e.g., In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 6; In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at\n17   1323-24.\n18        And yet we have an even more significant concern.   The\n19   Supreme Court disfavors interpretations of ambiguous Bankruptcy\n20   Code provisions (and amendments) that impose major changes in\n21   pre-existing practice in the absence of at least some discussion\n22   in the legislative history.   See Dewsnup v. Timm, 502 U.S. 410,\n23   419 (1992).    The literal construction adherents reason that this\n24   concern is unjustified because the \u201creturn\u201d definition is\n25   unambiguous.   But our contextual reading of the statutory text\n26   convinces us otherwise.\n27        At the outermost circle of contextual reading, we must\n28   consider how the literal construction of the term \u201capplicable\n\n                                      21\n\f 1   filing requirements\u201d fits within Congress\u2019 statutory scheme for\n 2   excepting debts from discharge.    Recall that Congress\u2019 original\n 3   Bankruptcy Code enactment of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B) embodied a careful\n 4   balancing of the competing interests of the debtor, taxing\n 5   authorities and the debtor\u2019s other creditors.   See In re Ciotti,\n 6   638 F.3d at 279 (citing S.Rep. No. 95\u2013989, at 14 (1978),\n 7   reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5800)).    Nothing in the term\n 8   \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d or in the four general factors\n 9   that served as the impetus for BAPCPA manifests an intent to\n10   effect a sea-change in how Congress chose to balance the\n11   dischargeability of tax debts associated with untimely filed\n12   returns.\n13        The Supreme Court before BAPCPA recognized that \u201cexceptions\n14   to discharge should be confined to those plainly expressed,\u201d\n15   Kawaauhau v. Geiger, 523 U.S. 57, 62 (1998) (quoting Gleason v.\n16   Thaw, 236 U.S. 558, 562 (1915)), and the Supreme Court after\n17   BAPCPA continues to adhere to this same principle.   Bullock v.\n18   BankChampaign, N.A., 133 S. Ct. 1754, 1760 (2013).   Here, in\n19   light of our contextual reading of the term \u201capplicable filing\n20   requirements,\u201d we are not persuaded that the statutory text, as\n21   amended by BAPCPA, manifests a plainly expressed intent to re-\n22   balance the nondischargeability of tax debts associated with\n23   untimely filed tax returns.\n24\n     D.   Application of the Correct Definition of \u201cReturn\u201d to this\n25        Appeal\n26        Our rejection of the literal construction of the \u201creturn\u201d\n27   definition leaves us with the task of articulating what the\n28   definition of \u201creturn\u201d in the hanging paragraph is supposed to\n\n                                       22\n\f 1   mean.    The generic terms \u201capplicable bankruptcy law\u201d and\n 2   \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d necessarily reflect that the\n 3   answer will depend on which nonbankruptcy laws are applicable\n 4   (federal or state or local) and what the applicable filing\n 5   requirements say.    \u201c[N]early all courts\u201d pre-BAPCPA utilized some\n 6   version of the Beard test.    In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1318.   In\n 7   other words, for purposes of determining the dischargeability of\n 8   federal income tax debt, the \u201creturn\u201d definition added by\n 9   Congress in 2005 effectively codified the Beard test, except that\n10   Congress in the second sentence of the hanging paragraph carved\n11   out some specific rules for tax returns prepared by taxing\n12   authorities.7\n13        In this appeal, in the context of late-filed federal income\n14   tax returns prepared and filed by the taxpayers, there is no\n15   convincing or persuasive indication that BAPCPA or the hanging\n16   paragraph abrogated Hatton II\u2019s holding that we should use\n17   In re Hindenlang\u2019s version of the Beard test \u2013 a test derived\n18   from nonbankruptcy law \u2013 to determine whether the Martins\u2019\n19   untimely tax returns qualify as tax returns for\n20   nondischargeability purposes.    That version of the Beard test\n21   provides:\n22        (1) it must purport to be a return; (2) it must be\n          executed under penalty of perjury; (3) it must contain\n23        sufficient data to allow calculation of tax; and (4) it\n          must represent an honest and reasonable attempt to\n24        satisfy the requirements of the tax law.\n25\n26\n          7\n27         We express no opinion on what \u201creturn\u201d means under\n     applicable nonbankruptcy law when state tax returns are in play,\n28   as that issue is not properly before us.\n\n                                      23\n\f 1   In re Hindenlang, 164 F.3d at 1033.8\n 2        Similar to what this Panel held in In re Nunez, the\n 3   bankruptcy court here concluded that it should utilize a\n 4   different version of the Beard test.    In this alternate version,\n 5   the prong of the test focusing on the honesty and reasonableness\n 6   of the debtor\u2019s efforts to file the return is narrow in scope and\n 7   considers only the form and substance of the purported return\n 8   while ignoring the length of delay, the reason for the delay, and\n 9   the number of tax years missed.    As we stated at the outset of\n10   this discussion, this alternate version of the Beard test is\n11   inconsistent with the holding and reasoning set forth in\n12   Hatton II, so we cannot uphold the bankruptcy court\u2019s usage of\n13   this alternate test.\n14        Hatton II offered two distinct reasons why the taxpayer\n15   there did not satisfy the Beard test.    Hatton II, 220 F.3d at\n16   1061.    First, Hatton II explained the the taxpayer had not signed\n17   any document under penalty of perjury, so the second Beard test\n18   factor was not met.    Id.   In addition, Hatton II explained that\n19\n          8\n20         The IRS follows the Beard test in defining the term\n     \u201creturn\u201d under many circumstances. As the bankruptcy court noted\n21   in its Memorandum Decision:\n22\n          The IRS has referenced the Beard Test in its revenue\n23        rulings and other materials. See Rev. Rul. 2005-59,\n          2005-2 C.B. 505 (2005) (clarifying when documents\n24        constitute valid returns under Beard Test in context of\n          joint filers); I.R.S. Chief Couns. Notice CC-2004-032,\n25        2004 WL 3210764 (Sept. 9, 2004) (\"The four part test\n26        set forth in [Beard] is widely accepted as the analysis\n          for determining what constitutes a return for purposes\n27        of the Internal Revenue Code.\").\n\n28   Mem. Dec. (March 31, 2014) at 20:23-26.\n\n                                       24\n\f 1   the taxpayer indisputably took no steps to cure his delinquency\n 2   in filing his 1983 federal income tax return, and did not begin\n 3   to cooperate with the IRS\u2019s efforts, until the IRS threatened to\n 4   levy on his wages and his bank account.    Id.   According to\n 5   Hatton II, these undisputed facts established that the taxpayer\n 6   had not engaged in \u201can honest and reasonable attempt to comply\n 7   with the requirements of the tax law\u201d as required by the fourth\n 8   Beard test factor.   Id.   The bankruptcy court posited that,\n 9   because Hatton II offered two separate and independent reasons\n10   why the Beard test was not met, the second reason given \u2013\n11   regarding the honesty and reasonableness of the taxpayer\u2019s\n12   efforts \u2013 perhaps was non-binding dicta.    We disagree.   When\n13   alternate grounds are given for a holding, neither ground\n14   constitutes non-binding dicta.    Exp. Grp. v. Reef Indus., Inc.,\n15   54 F.3d 1466, 1471 (9th Cir. 1995).\n16        The bankruptcy court attempted to offer some other reasons\n17   why it might not be bound by Hatton II, but none of these other\n18   reasons, even if valid, justify a departure from Hatton II\u2019s\n19   version of the Beard test, which included a broader honesty-and-\n20   reasonableness prong than the bankruptcy court utilized.     Because\n21   the bankruptcy court did not apply the correct legal standard for\n22   assessing the honesty and reasonableness of the Martins\u2019 efforts\n23   to comply with applicable tax laws, we must VACATE AND REMAND so\n24   that the bankruptcy court can apply the proper legal standard to\n25   the relevant facts of this case, which are not limited to the\n26   form and content of the Martins\u2019 filings, but also include the\n27   number of missing returns, the length of the delay, the reasons\n28   for the delay, and any other circumstances reasonably pertaining\n\n                                      25\n\f 1   to the honesty and reasonableness of the Martins\u2019 efforts.\n 2        In sum, we need to ensure that the bankruptcy court views\n 3   all of the relevant facts through the lens of the appropriate\n 4   legal standard set forth in Hatton II, and we furthermore believe\n 5   that the determination of whether all of the relevant facts and\n 6   circumstances constitute an honest and reasonable effort to\n 7   comply with the applicable tax laws is best made, in the first\n 8   instance, by the bankruptcy court.\n 9\n     E.   IRS Argument That Tax Debts Associated With Post-Assessment\n10        Tax Returns Are Always Nondischargeable\n11        There is only one other issue that we need to address.     We\n12   must address the IRS\u2019s argument that a tax debt associated with\n13   an IRS tax assessment made without the benefit of a taxpayer-\n14   prepared tax return always should be treated as nondischargeable.\n15        The IRS\u2019s argument is twofold.   First, the IRS contends\n16   that, when as here the taxpayer does not file his or her tax\n17   return until after the IRS has assessed taxes pursuant to\n18   Internal Revenue Code deficiency procedures, the debt arising\n19   from the assessment is (and always will be) a debt for which no\n20   return has been filed, thereby bringing the debt within the scope\n21   of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i) \u2013 a tax debt for which a tax return was\n22   required but never filed.   According to the IRS, it makes no\n23   difference whether the taxpayer, after assessment, belatedly\n24   files his or her tax return because the nature of the debt (as a\n25   debt arising from the assessment rather than the return) cannot\n26   and does not change under applicable tax law even when a return\n27   is later filed.   Aplt. Opn. Br. at pp. 7-15.\n28        Our initial reaction to this argument is that it tends to\n\n                                     26\n\f 1   prove too much.   If we were to accept the IRS\u2019s interpretation of\n 2   the nature of an assessment-based tax debt, it proves not only\n 3   that the tax liability arose without a tax return, but also that\n 4   a tax return was neither necessary nor \u201crequired\u201d to impose the\n 5   assessment-based tax debt.   In any event, even if the belated tax\n 6   return associated with an assessment-based tax debt was still\n 7   required in some sense, we agree with the reason offered by the\n 8   bankruptcy court for rejecting this argument.      As the bankruptcy\n 9   court explained, the tax debt within the meaning of the\n10   Bankruptcy Code preexists both the filing of the return and the\n11   issuance of the IRS assessment.    Mem. Dec. (March 31, 2014) at\n12   p. 12 (citing Rhodes v. United States (In re Rhodes), 498 B.R.\n13   357, 362 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2013); see also In re Mallo, 774 F.3d\n14   at 1326 (following In re Rhodes).      Under the Internal Revenue\n15   Code, the tax debt \u2013 or right to payment \u2013 arises at the end of\n16   each tax year and not later on.    In re Rhodes, 498 B.R. at 362.\n17   An assessment is merely a method for fixing the amount of that\n18   debt and not the source of the debt itself.      Id.\n19        Second, the IRS argues that a post-assessment tax return is\n20   the functional equivalent of no tax return at all.      As the IRS\n21   puts it, once it is forced to assess taxes without the benefit of\n22   a taxpayer-prepared return, a later-filed tax return fails to\n23   serve its primary function as a vehicle for self-reporting tax\n24   liability.   We already rejected this identical argument in\n25   In re Nunez, 232 B.R. 778, 781-82 (9th Cir. BAP 1999).      While\n26   some parts of In re Nunez were sub-silentio overruled by\n27   Hatton II, Hatton II did not overrule this part of In re Nunez.\n28   Nor did Hatton II overrule the following reasoning from\n\n                                       27\n\f 1   In re Nunez supporting its rejection of the IRS\u2019s post-assessment\n 2   tax return argument:\n 3        Congress could have conditioned discharge of tax debt\n          on whether a return was filed prior to an assessment.\n 4        As correctly noted by the [bankruptcy] court, Congress\n          used assessment as a trigger for other time periods in\n 5        the Code, for example, the priority qualifications\n          found in Section 507(a)(8)(A)(ii). When Congress\n 6        includes particular language in one section of the\n          Code, but omits it in another, it is presumed to have\n 7        acted intentionally and purposely. We will not read\n          into Section 523(a)(1)(B) the requirement that a debtor\n 8        must have filed a return prior to an assessment by the\n          IRS.\n 9\n10   In re Nunez, 232 B.R. at 782 (internal citation omitted).\n11        Indeed, Hatton II is consistent with Nunez\u2019s rejection of\n12   the IRS\u2019s post-assessment tax return argument in the following\n13   sense: if Hatton II had agreed with the IRS that a post-\n14   assessment tax return is no tax return at all, Hatton II would\n15   not have had any need to apply the Beard test (as it did) to\n16   resolve the question of whether the debtor there had filed a\n17   return within the meaning the nondischargeability statute.\n18   Simply put, Hatton II\u2019s holding and reasoning cannot be\n19   reconciled with the IRS\u2019s post-assessment tax return argument.\n20        Accordingly, we reject both aspects of the IRS\u2019s post-\n21   assessment tax return argument.\n22                              CONCLUSION\n23        For the reasons set forth above, we VACATE the bankruptcy\n24   court\u2019s judgment holding that the Martins\u2019 tax debt was\n25   dischargeable, and we REMAND for further proceedings consistent\n26   with this decision.\n27\n28\n\n                                       28\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                             FILED\n 1                          ORDERED PUBLISHED                 DEC 17 2015\n                                                          SUSAN M.

According to an\n 3   increasing number of courts, including some courts of appeal, the\n 4   answer is: when the tax return, otherwise wholly compliant with\n 5   applicable tax laws, is filed a second (or more) late.    According\n 6   to these courts, by way of the 2005 Bankruptcy Code amendments,\n 7   Congress intended to make a substantial and exceptionally harsh\n 8   change to nondischargeability law by adding a hanging paragraph\n 9   at the end of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)1 defining the term \u201creturn\u201d to\n10   exclude any taxpayer filing that does not wholly and strictly\n11   comply with all applicable return filing requirements, even if\n12   the taxing authority itself could and would forgive that\n13   noncompliance.   Indeed, the United States rejects this statutory\n14   interpretation in this appeal.\n15        The courts adopting a literal construction of the \u201creturn\u201d\n16   definition more or less admit that their unforgiving view of\n17   congressional intent cannot be squared within the context of\n18   \u00a7 523(a), or even within the narrower context of the hanging\n19   paragraph itself, without running into some significant\n20   conundrums.   The second sentence of the hanging paragraph\n21   expressly includes within the definition of \u201creturn\u201d some types\n22   of returns that the taxing authority prepares on behalf of the\n23   taxpayer, when the taxpayer never gets around to it.   Why\n24   Congress would want to treat a taxpayer who files a tax return a\n25\n          1\n26         Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section\n     references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-1532, and\n27   all \"Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n     Procedure, Rules 1001-9037. All \u201cCivil Rule\u201d references are to\n28   the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n                                      2\n\f 1   month or a week or even a day late \u2013 possibly for reasons beyond\n 2   his or her control \u2013 so much more harshly than a taxpayer who\n 3   never files a tax return on his or her own behalf is a mystery\n 4   that literal construction adherents never adequately explain.\n 5   Nor have they adequately explained why, later on in the second\n 6   sentence of the hanging paragraph, Congress felt a need to\n 7   explicitly exclude from the \u201creturn\u201d definition another type of\n 8   return filed by taxing authorities on behalf of taxpayers when\n 9   that exclusion is superfluous if one accepts a literal\n10   construction of the first sentence of the hanging paragraph.\n11        When one looks beyond the hanging paragraph, at the context\n12   of the nondischargeability statute as a whole and Congress\u2019\n13   scheme for nondischargeable debts, one encounters additional,\n14   even-more-serious problems with the literal construction of the\n15   \u201creturn\u201d definition.   Section 523(a)(1)(B)(ii), which pre-existed\n16   the 2005 amendments, already contains a specific and carefully-\n17   balanced treatment of tax debts associated with untimely-filed\n18   tax returns.   Literal construction of the \u201creturn\u201d definition\n19   renders \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) all but meaningless - reducing the\n20   potential application of that provision to a minuscule scope.\n21   And, according to the literal construction adherents, Congress\n22   intended the \u201creturn\u201d definition to accomplish this dramatic re-\n23   balancing of the dischargeability of tax debt without a single\n24   legislative comment to that effect.\n25        In light of these concerns arising from a contextual reading\n26   of the hanging paragraph, we reject the literal construction of\n27   the \u201creturn\u201d definition.   We further conclude that there is\n28   binding Ninth Circuit authority predating the 2005 amendments\n\n                                      3\n\f 1   instructing us how to determine when a taxpayer filing should be\n 2   treated as a return for nondischargeability purposes and that\n 3   authority was not abrogated by the 2005 amendments.\n 4        The bankruptcy court erred because it declined to apply the\n 5   existing Ninth Circuit test as to what constitutes a \u201creturn,\u201d so\n 6   we VACATE the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling declaring the Martins\u2019\n 7   tax debt dischargeable, and we REMAND so that the bankruptcy\n 8   court can apply the Ninth Circuit test.\n 9                                    FACTS\n10        The facts are undisputed.    The Martins did not file their\n11   tax returns for 2004, 2005 and 2006 at the time they were due.\n12   Consequently, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) conducted an\n13   audit examination beginning in June 2008 to fix the amount of the\n14   Martins\u2019 tax liability for those three years.       Without the\n15   benefit of the Martins\u2019 self-reported income tax data in the form\n16   of tax returns, the IRS duly followed the deficiency and\n17   assessment procedures set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.\n18   See 26, U.S.C. \u00a7 6201, et seq.    In August 2008, following the\n19   completion of the audit examination, the IRS issued a notice of\n20   deficiency for each of the three tax years.\n21        The Martins did not respond to the notices of deficiency,\n22   but the notices did spur the Martins to hire a new accountant to\n23   prepare the missing tax returns.       In December 2008, the\n24   accountant signed and completed the Martins\u2019 tax returns for\n25   2004, 2005 and 2006, but the Martins did not get around to\n26   signing and filing the tax returns until six months later in June\n27   2009.   There is no evidence explaining the reason for the\n28   Martins\u2019 several-year delay in preparing their 2004, 2005 and\n\n                                        4\n\f 1   2006 tax returns, nor is there any evidence explaining the\n 2   Martins\u2019 delay in signing and filing the completed returns.2\n 3\n          2\n 4         While it does not constitute evidence in the strict sense,\n     at the summary judgment oral argument, the Martins attempted to\n 5   explain the delays. With respect to their initial failure to\n     timely prepare their 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax returns, Ms. Martin\n 6   stated:\n 7        [W]e had problems with our previous accountant. Her\n 8        husband died and she had to let us go and -- and so she\n          -- basically we were trying to -- she had her assistant\n 9        try to finish us up. And she got sick and held on to\n          our taxes for over a year. And we repeatedly tried to\n10        get them back from her, and she kept saying she was\n          going to finish them.\n11\n12        And then by the time we realized -- finally we\n          demanded them back, and we had to find a new accountant\n13        who had to start fresh. And that was Andrea, and\n          that's when she started reassessing and doing all our\n14        taxes to help get us caught up.\n15\n     Hr\u2019g Tr. (Aug. 29, 2013) at 6:4-15. With respect to the six-\n16   month delay in signing and filing the completed returns, the\n     bankruptcy court and Ms. Martin engaged in the following\n17   colloquy:\n18        THE COURT: Why didn't the tax returns get filed [six]\n19        months earlier, when the accountant signed them?\n\n20        SUSAN MARTIN: Because she actually finished them on\n          12-18-08. And I believe we were waiting for two other\n21        years that were behind, '07 and '08, to be completed\n          before we put them all in together.\n22\n23        THE COURT: Why?   Why.   Why didn't -- why didn't --\n\n24        SUSAN MARTIN: I don't know. I -- I just feel like we\n          were trying to get it all in at once. I -- I guess\n25        that's why we waited. I was wondering the same thing,\n26        why we didn't get them in right away. But we had so\n          many back taxes that we were just trying to get them\n27        all done. And that's why they sat for a little while.\n\n28                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                       5\n\f 1        Meanwhile, having not heard from the Martins, the IRS made\n 2   assessments against the Martins for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax\n 3   years in March 2009.     Thereafter, the IRS twice sent the Martins\n 4   notices of the unpaid taxes and demands for payment \u2013 once in\n 5   March 2009 and another time in April 2009.       The IRS then gave the\n 6   Martins notice of its intent to collect the assessed taxes by\n 7   levy.\n 8        Only after the IRS threatened to collect the unpaid taxes\n 9   did the Martins finally file their 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax\n10   returns.     The IRS accepted the untimely returns and adjusted the\n11   Martins\u2019 tax liability based on the information set forth in the\n12   returns.     The IRS adjusted their 2004 tax liability downward by\n13   roughly $1,000 (from $18,432 to $17,358), their 2005 tax\n14   liability upward by roughly $5,000 (from $9,928 to $14,852), and\n15   their 2006 tax liability downward by roughly $5,000 (from $32,133\n16   to $27,010).\n17        The Martins commenced their chapter 7 bankruptcy case in\n18   November 2011 and commenced pro se the adversary proceeding from\n19   which this appeal arises in July 2012.       By way of their\n20   complaint, they sought a determination that their 2004, 2005 and\n21   2006 tax debt was dischargeable.       The IRS responded to the\n22   complaint by alleging that the subject tax debt was\n23   nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i), as a tax debt for\n24   which a tax return was required but never filed.3\n25\n          2\n26         (...continued)\n     Hr\u2019g Tr. (Aug. 29, 2013) at 5:7-19.\n27\n          3\n              Ultimately, the IRS conceded the dischargeability of the\n28                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                        6\n\f 1        The IRS filed a summary judgment motion based on the\n 2   undisputed facts.   The bankruptcy court denied the IRS\u2019s summary\n 3   judgment motion and instead, on the undisputed facts, granted\n 4   judgment in favor of the Martins.    In a thoughtful, thorough and\n 5   detailed memorandum of decision, the bankruptcy court rejected\n 6   the IRS\u2019s legal theories attempting to explain why a tax return\n 7   filed post-assessment is the functional equivalent of no tax\n 8   return at all for both tax purposes and nondischargeability\n 9   purposes.\n10        The bankruptcy court also grappled with the meaning of the\n11   word \u201creturn\u201d for purposes of the nondischargeability statute,\n12   both before and after the 2005 Bankruptcy Code amendments.\n13   Ultimately, the bankruptcy court held that the correct standard\n14   for determining whether a taxpayer filing qualified as a return\n15   for purposes of the nondischargeability statute had not changed\n16   as a result of the 2005 amendments.   According to the bankruptcy\n17   court, the test established in the tax court decision of Beard v.\n18   Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774\u201379 (1984), aff'd </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471676\"><a href=\"/opinion/471676/robert-d-beard-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th\n19   Cir. 1986), should be used to determine whether the debtor\n20   taxpayer had filed a return.

Whereas\n 8   the honest-and reasonable inquiry in the Hatton/Hindenlang\n 9   version is broad in scope and at least partially subjective in\n10   focus, the honest-and-reasonable inquiry in the version of the\n11   Beard test utilized by the bankruptcy court was narrow in scope\n12   and exclusively objective in focus.   The bankruptcy court only\n13   considered the face of the Martins\u2019 tax filings and looked at the\n14   form and content of those filings in order to determine, from an\n15   objective standpoint, that the Martins\u2019 filings for the 2004,\n16   2005 and 2006 tax years constituted \u201can honest and reasonable\n17   attempt to satisfy the requirements of the tax law.\u201d\n18        The bankruptcy court concluded that the Martins\u2019 2004, 2005\n19   and 2006 tax filings qualified as returns for nondischargeability\n20   purposes and granted judgment in their favor on that basis.

The Parties\u2019 Positions\n 9        In this appeal, the IRS has advocated two distinct\n10   positions: an official, preferred position and an unofficial,\n11   fall-back position.    Officially, the IRS contends that the\n12   dischargeability of income tax debt associated with a late-filed\n13   tax return should hinge on whether the taxpayer filed the return\n14   before or after the IRS made any assessment.    This position is\n15   not new for the IRS.    See, e.g., Mallo v. I.R.S.

According to the\n23   IRS, if the bankruptcy court here had applied the Ninth Circuit\n24   version of the Beard test, it should have and would have\n25   concluded that the Martins\u2019 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax returns do\n26   not qualify as returns for nondischargeability purposes.\n27        The Martins similarly contend that the Beard test applies,\n28   but they insist that the bankruptcy court correctly determined\n\n                                       9\n\f 1   under the Beard test that their 2004, 2005 and 2006 tax returns\n 2   qualify as returns for nondischargeability purposes.\n 3         Notably, neither side here advocates in favor of the literal\n 4   construction of the \u201creturn\u201d definition that Congress added to\n 5   the nondischargeability statute as part of the 2005 Bankruptcy\n 6   Code amendments.    Indeed, in this case and in other cases, the\n 7   IRS expressly has rejected the literal construction and has\n 8   stated that the literal construction leads to \u201coverly harsh\u201d\n 9   results.    In re Wogoman, 475 B.R. at 250.   Instead, the IRS has\n10   advocated for its less draconian approach focusing on whether the\n11   taxpayer filing occurred before or after an IRS tax assessment.\n12   Id.\n13         Even though neither side here supports the literal\n14   construction of the \u201creturn\u201d definition, in light of the\n15   increasing number of courts that have adopted that construction,\n16   our analysis necessarily focuses on that approach first.    Before\n17   undertaking that analysis, however, we first describe the legal\n18   state of affairs in the Ninth Circuit before Congress added the\n19   \u201creturn\u201d definition to the nondischargeability statute.\n20   B.

Beard held that a document qualifies as a return if:\n15        (1) it must purport to be a return; (2) it must be\n          executed under penalty of perjury; (3) it must contain\n16        sufficient data to allow calculation of tax; and (4) it\n          must represent an honest and reasonable attempt to\n17        satisfy the requirements of the tax law.\n18   In re Hindenlang, 164 F.3d at 1033.     Hatton I applied the Beard\n19   test in upholding the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding that the debtor\n20   had filed a return within the meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i).\n21   Hatton I reasoned that the debtor taxpayer came close enough to\n22   filing a return by meeting with the IRS, by acquiescing to the\n23   substitute return the IRS filed on the debtor taxpayer\u2019s behalf,\n24   by acknowledging his liability for 1983 taxes in the amount set\n25   forth in the substitute return, and by entering into an\n26   installment payment agreement, pursuant to which debtor agreed to\n27   pay his delinquent taxes at a rate of $200 per month.\n28        The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.

Hatton II rejected Hatton I\u2019s attempted\n 2   expansion of the Beard test to include a debtor taxpayer who had\n 3   not signed any document under penalty of perjury and who \u201cmade\n 4   every attempt to avoid paying his taxes\u201d until the IRS sent the\n 5   debtor taxpayer a letter threatening to levy on his wages and\n 6   bank accounts and to seize his property.

For\n 8   purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i), Hatton II explicitly adopted\n 9   Beard\u2019s definition of return, as articulated in\n10   In re Hindenlang.5\n11        By adopting In re Hindenlang\u2019s version of the Beard test,\n12   Hatton II sub silentio overruled, at least in part, another Panel\n13   decision \u2013 United States v.

In re Nunez adopted a slightly\n15\n16\n          5\n           There is nothing in Hatton II suggesting that it adopted\n17   other aspects of In re Hindenlang, particularly\n     In re Hindenlang\u2019s holding that post-assessment tax returns filed\n18   by the taxpayer never qualify as returns for purposes of\n19   \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B). To the contrary, Hatton II\u2019s analysis \u2013\n     especially its reliance on the Beard test to determine whether\n20   the taxpayer filed a return \u2013 is inconsistent with\n     In re Hindenlang\u2019s pre- or post-assessment test. As stated in\n21   one persuasive bankruptcy court decision:\n22\n          Had the Hatton court adopted the Hindenlang [pre- or\n23        post-assessment] Rule, it would not have needed to\n          consider whether the Debtor had executed the\n24        submissions under penalty of perjury or the Debtor's\n          subjective intent post assessment. The court would\n25        have simply determined that the debtor's post\n26        assessment submissions, could not as a matter of law,\n          constitute returns under \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B).\n27\n     Rushing v.

In re Nunez, therefore, excluded from its honesty-and-\n 9   reasonableness analysis the length of the delay in the taxpayer\u2019s\n10   filing, the reason for the delay and the number of tax years for\n11   which timely filings were missed.      Id.   It is impossible to\n12   reconcile this aspect of In re Nunez with Hatton II\u2019s honesty-\n13   and-reasonableness analysis, which largely hinged on the delay in\n14   taxpayer compliance.    See Hatton II, 220 F.3d at 1061.\n15        In short, in the Ninth Circuit, the Hatton II/\n16   In re Hindenlang version of the Beard test indisputably governed\n17   the definition of the term \u201creturn\u201d for purposes of determining\n18   the nondischargeability of tax debts, at least until the\n19   enactment of BAPCPA.    In the next section, we attempt to discern\n20   how (if at all) BAPCPA changed the legal landscape.\n21   C.   The Impact of BAPCPA on the Nondischargeability of Tax Debts\n22           Recall that, when Congress first enacted the Bankruptcy\n23   Code in 1978, it specifically noted that \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)\n24   represented a careful balancing of the competing interests of the\n25   debtor, the taxing authority, and the debtor\u2019s other creditors.\n26   See Maryland v.

In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1327.6\n10   But BAPCPA was accompanied by a general statement of legislative\n11   intent indicating that the 2005 amendments as a whole were\n12   motivated by four general factors:\n13        the \u201crecent escalation of consumer bankruptcy filings,\u201d\n          the \u201csignificant losses . . . associated with\n14        bankruptcy filings,\u201d the fact that the \u201cbankruptcy\n          system has loopholes and incentives that allow\n15\n16\n          6\n           Congress did explain the second sentence of the hanging\n17   paragraph, as follows:\n18        Income Tax Returns Prepared by Tax Authorities.\n19        Section 714 of the Act amends section 523(a) of the\n          Bankruptcy Code to provide that a return prepared\n20        pursuant to section 6020(a) of the Internal Revenue\n          Code, or similar State or local law, constitutes filing\n21        a return (and the debt can be discharged), but that a\n          return filed on behalf of a taxpayer pursuant to\n22\n          section 6020(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, or\n23        similar State or local law, does not constitute filing\n          a return (and the debt cannot be discharged).\n24\n     H.R.

It seems odd that Congress would bother to\n26   explain the relatively minuscule effect of the second sentence of\n     the hanging paragraph but not offer any legislative comment on\n27   the first sentence, which literal construction adherents claim\n     dramatically altered the nondischargeability of tax debt\n28   associated with untimely filed tax returns.\n\n                                     14\n\f 1        and\u2014sometimes\u2014even encourage opportunistic personal\n          filings and abuse,\u201d and \u201cthe fact that some bankruptcy\n 2        debtors are able to repay a significant portion of\n          their debts.\u201d\n 3\n 4   In re Ciotti, 638 F.3d at 279 (citing H.R.Rep.

The hanging\n 9   paragraph consists of two sentences, the first of which defines\n10   the term \u201creturn\u201d and the second of which further refines that\n11   definition by explicitly including a certain type of return\n12   prepared by the taxing authority on behalf of the taxpayer and by\n13   expressly excluding another.   The full text of the hanging\n14   paragraph provides as follows:\n15        For purposes of this subsection, the term \u201creturn\u201d\n          means a return that satisfies the requirements of\n16        applicable nonbankruptcy law (including applicable\n          filing requirements). Such term includes a return\n17        prepared pursuant to section 6020(a) of the Internal\n          Revenue Code of 1986, or similar State or local law, or\n18        a written stipulation to a judgment or a final order\n          entered by a nonbankruptcy tribunal, but does not\n19        include a return made pursuant to section 6020(b) of\n          the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or a similar State\n20        or local law.\n21   11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(*).\n22        A number of courts, including several Courts of Appeal, have\n23   addressed the issue of what the \u201creturn\u201d definition means, and\n24   many of them have held that the term \u201capplicable filing\n25   requirements\u201d is unambiguous and that the plain and ordinary\n26   meaning of the term necessarily includes time deadlines for\n27   filing returns as stated in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.\n28   \u00a7 6072(a), and/or in equivalent state statutes.   Therefore, these\n\n                                      15\n\f 1   literal construction courts have concluded that untimely returns\n 2   are not returns at all for purposes of the nondischargeability\n 3   statute.

They rely heavily (if not exclusively) on the plain\n10   language of the phrase \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d to\n11   conclude that Congress intended by way of the \u201creturn\u201d definition\n12   in the hanging paragraph to except from discharge the tax debts\n13   of all taxpayers whose tax returns do not strictly comply with\n14   all filing requirements \u2013 including time deadlines.    See, e.g.,\n15   In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 4-5; In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1321;\n16   In re McCoy, 666 F.3d at 932.    In doing so, they gloss over one\n17   of the most important rules of plain meaning statutory\n18   construction: that the meaning of a statutory term only is\n19   considered plain and unambiguous if the term is clearly\n20   understood in the context of the words surrounding it and in the\n21   context of the larger statutory scheme.\n22        The Supreme court reiterated the vital importance of\n23   contextual reading in Yates v.

In\n 3   fact, the Yates dissent, in which four Justices joined, was even\n 4   more compelling on this point:\n 5        I agree with the plurality (really, who does not?) that\n          context matters in interpreting statutes. We do not\n 6        \u201cconstrue the meaning of statutory terms in a vacuum.\u201d\n          Rather, we interpret particular words \u201cin their context\n 7        and with a view to their place in the overall statutory\n          scheme.\u201d And sometimes that means, as the plurality\n 8        says, that the dictionary definition of a disputed term\n          cannot control.\n 9\n10   Id. at 1092 (Justice Kagan dissenting) (citations omitted).\n11        The more one considers the phrase \u201capplicable filing\n12   requirements\u201d in context, the more doubtful the literal\n13   construction becomes.   First, within the hanging paragraph\n14   itself, the second sentence does not square with the so-called\n15   ordinary meaning of the term \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d\n16   found in the first sentence.   The literal construction of\n17   \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d effectively excepts from\n18   discharge all taxes associated with untimely-filed returns, but\n19   the second sentence adds right back into the definition returns\n20   prepared by taxing authorities under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6020(a) or under\n21   equivalent state statutes.   That subsection provides:\n22        (a) Preparation of return by Secretary.--If any person\n          shall fail to make a return required by this title or\n23        by regulations prescribed thereunder, but shall consent\n          to disclose all information necessary for the\n24        preparation thereof, then, and in that case, the\n          Secretary may prepare such return, which, being signed\n25        by such person, may be received by the Secretary as the\n          return of such person.\n26\n27   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6020(a).    Thus, under the literal construction of the\n28   hanging paragraph, a debtor taxpayer who is one month or one day\n\n                                      17\n\f 1   or even one hour late in filing his or her return will have his\n 2   associated tax debt excepted from discharge, whereas a debtor\n 3   taxpayer who never bothers to file his or her own return can\n 4   discharge his or her associated tax debt if the IRS fortuitously\n 5   prepares a return on that person\u2019s behalf.\n 6        Why would Congress want to treat debtor taxpayers who do\n 7   nothing on their own to comply with their return filing\n 8   obligations so much better than debtor taxpayers who \u2013 perhaps\n 9   for reasons beyond their control \u2013 miss the filing deadline by as\n10   little as a day but then conscientiously complete and file their\n11   return?   The literal construction adherents have an answer to\n12   this question, but that answer is hardly persuasive.    The literal\n13   construction adherents speculate that Congress wanted to make\n14   available to the taxing authorities a \u201ccarrot\u201d they could offer\n15   to formerly uncooperative taxpayers to encourage their\n16   cooperation going forward.    In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 7;\n17   In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1324; In re McCoy, 666 F.3d at 931.\n18        This makes no sense.    The literal construction adherents\n19   admit (at least some of them do) that it is extremely rare for\n20   taxing authorities to engage in the expensive and time-consuming\n21   process of preparing tax returns on behalf of taxpayers.    See,\n22   e.g., In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 6-7.    More importantly, the\n23   literal construction of the \u201creturn\u201d definition in reality\n24   creates an incentive for impoverished taxpayers who already are\n25   late in filing one or more tax returns to further delay, with the\n26   hope that they would be some of the lucky few for whom the taxing\n27   authorities decide to prepare returns on the taxpayers\u2019 behalf\n28   (which then would enable them under the literal construction to\n\n                                      18\n\f 1   obtain a discharge of an otherwise nondischargeable tax debt).\n 2        When read with a literal construction, the disconnect\n 3   between the first and second sentences of the hanging paragraph\n 4   does not end there.    In the last part of the second sentence, the\n 5   hanging paragraph excludes from the definition of \u201creturn\u201d\n 6   returns prepared by taxing authorities under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6020(b)\n 7   or under equivalent state statutes.   That subsection provides in\n 8   relevant part:\n 9        (b) Execution of return by Secretary.--\n10             (1) Authority of Secretary to execute return.--If\n               any person fails to make any return required by\n11             any internal revenue law or regulation made\n               thereunder at the time prescribed therefor, or\n12             makes, willfully or otherwise, a false or\n               fraudulent return, the Secretary shall make such\n13             return from his own knowledge and from such\n               information as he can obtain through testimony or\n14             otherwise.\n15   26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6020(b).    Thus, according to the literal construction\n16   adherents, even though the first sentence of the hanging\n17   paragraph already excludes all late-filed returns from the\n18   definition of \u201creturn,\u201d Congress felt it necessary (supposedly\n19   for the sake of clarity) to repeat one tiny aspect of this\n20   exclusion one sentence later \u2013 the exclusion with respect to \u00a7\n21   6020(b) returns, which by definition are untimely.   See, e.g., In\n22   re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 7;   In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1324.   Many\n23   literal construction adherents acknowledge that a statute should,\n24   if possible, be construed in a manner that avoids rendering any\n25   part of it redundant.   See, e.g., In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 6;\n26   In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1317.   Indeed, In re Fahey cites to\n27   TRW Inc. v. Andrews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118465\"><a href=\"/opinion/118465/trw-inc-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (2001), which stated: \u201c[i]t\n28   is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute\n\n                                      19\n\f 1   ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be\n 2   prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous,\n 3   void, or insignificant.\u201d   Id. (citations and internal quotation\n 4   marks omitted and emphasis added).\n 5        The literal construction adherents offer little to explain\n 6   their acceptance of the redundancy created by their\n 7   interpretation of the hanging paragraph.   According to them,\n 8   Congress likely was redundant for the sake of clarity.   But this\n 9   explanation is wholly at odds with the cardinal principle of\n10   statutory construction referenced immediately above.\n11   Alternately, the literal construction adherents dismiss the\n12   redundancy as insignificant, especially in light of the plain\n13   meaning of the term \u201capplicable filing requirements.\u201d    See, e.g.,\n14   In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 7.   This reasoning not only is circular\n15   but also undermines a contextual reading of the statute.\n16        Assuming the literal construction of the term \u201capplicable\n17   filing requirements\u201d already has not collapsed under the weight\n18   of the contextual difficulties found within the hanging paragraph\n19   itself, another more-extreme level of difficulties awaits within\n20   \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii).   In that subparagraph, as originally enacted\n21   in 1978, Congress clearly excepted from discharge any and all tax\n22   debts associated with untimely filed returns that were filed\n23   within two years of the debtor\u2019s bankruptcy petition filing.\n24   In re Ciotti, 638 F.3d at 279.   Before BAPCPA, there was no\n25   genuine dispute regarding the broad coverage of this\n26   subparagraph.   See id.   After BAPCPA, at least under the literal\n27   construction, the once-expansive coverage of this subparagraph\n28   has been dramatically reduced to an infinitesimal scope \u2013 a scope\n\n                                      20\n\f 1   bordering on and approaching zero.    As the literal construction\n 2   adherents would have it, this subparagraph post-BAPCPA only would\n 3   apply to \u00a7 6020(a) returns, since \u00a7 6020(a) returns are the only\n 4   type of untimely returns that fall within the definition of\n 5   \u201creturn\u201d under the literal construction.   See, e.g., In re Fahey,\n 6   779 F.3d at 6; In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1323-24.\n 7        Structurally, interpreting the definitional hanging\n 8   paragraph in a way that dramatically alters the coverage of\n 9   \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) is an excellent example of \u201cthe tail wagging\n10   the dog.\u201d   This structural concern is the least of our concerns.\n11   The literal construction also renders \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(ii) all but\n12   meaningless.   The literal construction adherents explain away\n13   this concern by suggesting that, while \u201cmeaningless\u201d is not okay\n14   under the cardinal rule disfavoring interpretations that render\n15   part of a statute superfluous, \u201call but meaningless\u201d is fine.\n16   See, e.g., In re Fahey, 779 F.3d at 6; In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at\n17   1323-24.\n18        And yet we have an even more significant concern.   The\n19   Supreme Court disfavors interpretations of ambiguous Bankruptcy\n20   Code provisions (and amendments) that impose major changes in\n21   pre-existing practice in the absence of at least some discussion\n22   in the legislative history.   See Dewsnup v. Timm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112680\"><a href=\"/opinion/112680/dewsnup-v-timm/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n23   419 (1992).    The literal construction adherents reason that this\n24   concern is unjustified because the \u201creturn\u201d definition is\n25   unambiguous.   But our contextual reading of the statutory text\n26   convinces us otherwise.\n27        At the outermost circle of contextual reading, we must\n28   consider how the literal construction of the term \u201capplicable\n\n                                      21\n\f 1   filing requirements\u201d fits within Congress\u2019 statutory scheme for\n 2   excepting debts from discharge.    Recall that Congress\u2019 original\n 3   Bankruptcy Code enactment of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B) embodied a careful\n 4   balancing of the competing interests of the debtor, taxing\n 5   authorities and the debtor\u2019s other creditors.   See In re Ciotti,\n 6   638 F.3d at 279 (citing S.Rep. No. 95\u2013989, at 14 (1978),\n 7   reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5800)).    Nothing in the term\n 8   \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d or in the four general factors\n 9   that served as the impetus for BAPCPA manifests an intent to\n10   effect a sea-change in how Congress chose to balance the\n11   dischargeability of tax debts associated with untimely filed\n12   returns.\n13        The Supreme Court before BAPCPA recognized that \u201cexceptions\n14   to discharge should be confined to those plainly expressed,\u201d\n15   Kawaauhau v.

Here, in\n19   light of our contextual reading of the term \u201capplicable filing\n20   requirements,\u201d we are not persuaded that the statutory text, as\n21   amended by BAPCPA, manifests a plainly expressed intent to re-\n22   balance the nondischargeability of tax debts associated with\n23   untimely filed tax returns.\n24\n     D.   Application of the Correct Definition of \u201cReturn\u201d to this\n25        Appeal\n26        Our rejection of the literal construction of the \u201creturn\u201d\n27   definition leaves us with the task of articulating what the\n28   definition of \u201creturn\u201d in the hanging paragraph is supposed to\n\n                                       22\n\f 1   mean.    The generic terms \u201capplicable bankruptcy law\u201d and\n 2   \u201capplicable filing requirements\u201d necessarily reflect that the\n 3   answer will depend on which nonbankruptcy laws are applicable\n 4   (federal or state or local) and what the applicable filing\n 5   requirements say.    \u201c[N]early all courts\u201d pre-BAPCPA utilized some\n 6   version of the Beard test.    In re Mallo, 774 F.3d at 1318.   In\n 7   other words, for purposes of determining the dischargeability of\n 8   federal income tax debt, the \u201creturn\u201d definition added by\n 9   Congress in 2005 effectively codified the Beard test, except that\n10   Congress in the second sentence of the hanging paragraph carved\n11   out some specific rules for tax returns prepared by taxing\n12   authorities.7\n13        In this appeal, in the context of late-filed federal income\n14   tax returns prepared and filed by the taxpayers, there is no\n15   convincing or persuasive indication that BAPCPA or the hanging\n16   paragraph abrogated Hatton II\u2019s holding that we should use\n17   In re Hindenlang\u2019s version of the Beard test \u2013 a test derived\n18   from nonbankruptcy law \u2013 to determine whether the Martins\u2019\n19   untimely tax returns qualify as tax returns for\n20   nondischargeability purposes.    That version of the Beard test\n21   provides:\n22        (1) it must purport to be a return; (2) it must be\n          executed under penalty of perjury; (3) it must contain\n23        sufficient data to allow calculation of tax; and (4) it\n          must represent an honest and reasonable attempt to\n24        satisfy the requirements of the tax law.\n25\n26\n          7\n27         We express no opinion on what \u201creturn\u201d means under\n     applicable nonbankruptcy law when state tax returns are in play,\n28   as that issue is not properly before us.\n\n                                      23\n\f 1   In re Hindenlang, 164 F.3d at 1033.8\n 2        Similar to what this Panel held in In re Nunez, the\n 3   bankruptcy court here concluded that it should utilize a\n 4   different version of the Beard test.    In this alternate version,\n 5   the prong of the test focusing on the honesty and reasonableness\n 6   of the debtor\u2019s efforts to file the return is narrow in scope and\n 7   considers only the form and substance of the purported return\n 8   while ignoring the length of delay, the reason for the delay, and\n 9   the number of tax years missed.    As we stated at the outset of\n10   this discussion, this alternate version of the Beard test is\n11   inconsistent with the holding and reasoning set forth in\n12   Hatton II, so we cannot uphold the bankruptcy court\u2019s usage of\n13   this alternate test.\n14        Hatton II offered two distinct reasons why the taxpayer\n15   there did not satisfy the Beard test.    Hatton II, 220 F.3d at\n16   1061.    First, Hatton II explained the the taxpayer had not signed\n17   any document under penalty of perjury, so the second Beard test\n18   factor was not met.    Id.   In addition, Hatton II explained that\n19\n          8\n20         The IRS follows the Beard test in defining the term\n     \u201creturn\u201d under many circumstances. As the bankruptcy court noted\n21   in its Memorandum Decision:\n22\n          The IRS has referenced the Beard Test in its revenue\n23        rulings and other materials. See Rev. Rul. 2005-59,\n          2005-2 C.B. 505 (2005) (clarifying when documents\n24        constitute valid returns under Beard Test in context of\n          joint filers); I.R.S. Chief Couns.

Dec.

Id.   According to\n 5   Hatton II, these undisputed facts established that the taxpayer\n 6   had not engaged in \u201can honest and reasonable attempt to comply\n 7   with the requirements of the tax law\u201d as required by the fourth\n 8   Beard test factor.   Id.   The bankruptcy court posited that,\n 9   because Hatton II offered two separate and independent reasons\n10   why the Beard test was not met, the second reason given \u2013\n11   regarding the honesty and reasonableness of the taxpayer\u2019s\n12   efforts \u2013 perhaps was non-binding dicta.    We disagree.   When\n13   alternate grounds are given for a holding, neither ground\n14   constitutes non-binding dicta.    Exp. Grp. v.

Because\n21   the bankruptcy court did not apply the correct legal standard for\n22   assessing the honesty and reasonableness of the Martins\u2019 efforts\n23   to comply with applicable tax laws, we must VACATE AND REMAND so\n24   that the bankruptcy court can apply the proper legal standard to\n25   the relevant facts of this case, which are not limited to the\n26   form and content of the Martins\u2019 filings, but also include the\n27   number of missing returns, the length of the delay, the reasons\n28   for the delay, and any other circumstances reasonably pertaining\n\n                                      25\n\f 1   to the honesty and reasonableness of the Martins\u2019 efforts.\n 2        In sum, we need to ensure that the bankruptcy court views\n 3   all of the relevant facts through the lens of the appropriate\n 4   legal standard set forth in Hatton II, and we furthermore believe\n 5   that the determination of whether all of the relevant facts and\n 6   circumstances constitute an honest and reasonable effort to\n 7   comply with the applicable tax laws is best made, in the first\n 8   instance, by the bankruptcy court.\n 9\n     E.   IRS Argument That Tax Debts Associated With Post-Assessment\n10        Tax Returns Are Always Nondischargeable\n11        There is only one other issue that we need to address.     We\n12   must address the IRS\u2019s argument that a tax debt associated with\n13   an IRS tax assessment made without the benefit of a taxpayer-\n14   prepared tax return always should be treated as nondischargeable.\n15        The IRS\u2019s argument is twofold.   First, the IRS contends\n16   that, when as here the taxpayer does not file his or her tax\n17   return until after the IRS has assessed taxes pursuant to\n18   Internal Revenue Code deficiency procedures, the debt arising\n19   from the assessment is (and always will be) a debt for which no\n20   return has been filed, thereby bringing the debt within the scope\n21   of \u00a7 523(a)(1)(B)(i) \u2013 a tax debt for which a tax return was\n22   required but never filed.   According to the IRS, it makes no\n23   difference whether the taxpayer, after assessment, belatedly\n24   files his or her tax return because the nature of the debt (as a\n25   debt arising from the assessment rather than the return) cannot\n26   and does not change under applicable tax law even when a return\n27   is later filed.   Aplt. Opn. Br. at pp. 7-15.\n28        Our initial reaction to this argument is that it tends to\n\n                                     26\n\f 1   prove too much.   If we were to accept the IRS\u2019s interpretation of\n 2   the nature of an assessment-based tax debt, it proves not only\n 3   that the tax liability arose without a tax return, but also that\n 4   a tax return was neither necessary nor \u201crequired\u201d to impose the\n 5   assessment-based tax debt.   In any event, even if the belated tax\n 6   return associated with an assessment-based tax debt was still\n 7   required in some sense, we agree with the reason offered by the\n 8   bankruptcy court for rejecting this argument.      As the bankruptcy\n 9   court explained, the tax debt within the meaning of the\n10   Bankruptcy Code preexists both the filing of the return and the\n11   issuance of the IRS assessment.    Mem.

Under the Internal Revenue\n15   Code, the tax debt \u2013 or right to payment \u2013 arises at the end of\n16   each tax year and not later on.    In re Rhodes, 498 B.R. at 362.\n17   An assessment is merely a method for fixing the amount of that\n18   debt and not the source of the debt itself.      Id.\n19        Second, the IRS argues that a post-assessment tax return is\n20   the functional equivalent of no tax return at all.      As the IRS\n21   puts it, once it is forced to assess taxes without the benefit of\n22   a taxpayer-prepared return, a later-filed tax return fails to\n23   serve its primary function as a vehicle for self-reporting tax\n24   liability.   We already rejected this identical argument in\n25   In re Nunez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1941523\"><a href=\"/opinion/1941523/in-re-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 781-82 (9th Cir. BAP 1999).      While\n26   some parts of In re Nunez were sub-silentio overruled by\n27   Hatton II, Hatton II did not overrule this part of In re Nunez.\n28   Nor did Hatton II overrule the following reasoning from\n\n                                       27\n\f 1   In re Nunez supporting its rejection of the IRS\u2019s post-assessment\n 2   tax return argument:\n 3        Congress could have conditioned discharge of tax debt\n          on whether a return was filed prior to an assessment.\n 4        As correctly noted by the [bankruptcy] court, Congress\n          used assessment as a trigger for other time periods in\n 5        the Code, for example, the priority qualifications\n          found in Section 507(a)(8)(A)(ii). When Congress\n 6        includes particular language in one section of the\n          Code, but omits it in another, it is presumed to have\n 7        acted intentionally and purposely. We will not read\n          into Section 523(a)(1)(B) the requirement that a debtor\n 8        must have filed a return prior to an assessment by the\n          IRS.\n 9\n10   In re Nunez, 232 B.R. at 782 (internal citation omitted).\n11        Indeed, Hatton II is consistent with Nunez\u2019s rejection of\n12   the IRS\u2019s post-assessment tax return argument in the following\n13   sense: if Hatton II had agreed with the IRS that a post-\n14   assessment tax return is no tax return at all, Hatton II would\n15   not have had any need to apply the Beard test (as it did) to\n16   resolve the question of whether the debtor there had filed a\n17   return within the meaning the nondischargeability statute.\n18   Simply put, Hatton II\u2019s holding and reasoning cannot be\n19   reconciled with the IRS\u2019s post-assessment tax return argument.\n20        Accordingly, we reject both aspects of the IRS\u2019s post-\n21   assessment tax return argument.\n22                              CONCLUSION\n23        For the reasons set forth above, we VACATE the bankruptcy\n24   court\u2019s judgment holding that the Martins\u2019 tax debt was\n25   dischargeable, and we REMAND for further proceedings consistent\n26   with this decision.\n27\n28\n\n                                       28\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
