Having considered each\r\nmotion, the Court is of the opinion that the motion to strike should be denied and the\r\nmotion to extend should be granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tBy its motion to strike, Appellee requests this Court to dismiss this appeal, as a\r\nmatter of law, because Appellant has failed to preserve any error by failing to timely file a\r\nstatement of points pursuant to \u00a7 263.405 of the Texas Family Code.  <em>See In the Interest\r\nof R.C.,</em> No. 07-06-0444-CV <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1219046</span></span> (Tex.App.-Amarillo April 25, 2007, no pet.)<em>; \r\nCoey v.

(not designated for publication). \r\nAn appeal is subject to involuntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 42.3 of the Texas Rules of\r\nAppellate Procedure for three specific reasons: (a) want of jurisdiction; (b) want of\r\nprosecution; and (c) because the appellant has failed to comply with a requirement of the\r\nTexas Rules of Appellate Procedure, a court order, or a notice from the clerk requiring a\r\nresponse or other action within a specified time.  Because Appellee's motion to strike\r\nAppellant's pleadings and involuntarily dismiss this appeal does not raise a ground upon\r\nwhich this appeal can be summarily dismissed, the motion is denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAs noted by the motion to extend time to file Appellee's brief, Appellant, Timothy\r\nHarrison Dustman, has already filed his brief and Appellant, Natasha Carpenter, has failed\r\nto file her brief.  Under these circumstances, and in the context of an accelerated appeal,\r\nthe Court finds that good cause does exists to extend the deadline for the filing of\r\nAppellee's brief by 15 days.  Therefore, Appellee's brief in response to Appellant, Timothy\r\nHarrison Dustman's brief is now due on August 9, 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIt is so ordered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPer Curiam</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLsdException Locked=\"false\" Priority=\"9\" QFormat=\"true\" Name=\"heading 5\"/&gt;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"WordSection1\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>NO. <span>07-10-00206-CR</span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>IN THE COURT OF APPEALS<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>FOR THE\r\nSEVENTH DISTRICT OF TEXAS<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>AT\r\nAMARILLO<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>PANEL A<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>JANUARY\r\n28, 2011<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>RUDY PENA, APPELLANT<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>v.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>THE STATE OF TEXAS, APPELLEE </span><span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><span>\u00a0</span>FROM THE 100TH DISTRICT COURT OF CARSON\r\nCOUNTY;<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span><p>\u00a0</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>NO. 3156;

two vehicles traveled about two miles in\r\nHutchinson County, and then some distance further into Carson County, as the\r\npolice vehicle\u0092s lights and siren were activated.<span>\u00a0 </span>During the portion of the pursuit on the <span class=\"SpellE\">caliche</span> road, McWilliams followed only thirty to fifty\r\nyards behind appellant.<span>\u00a0 </span>The pursuit\r\nlasted
