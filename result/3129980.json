On April 3,\r\n2009, Jonathan filed an Original Petition for Divorce, and on September 25, 2009 the trial court\r\nentered a post-answer default judgment against Natalie.  On October 20, 2009, Natalie filed a motion\r\nfor new trial, which was orally granted by Judge Antonia Arteaga at a hearing on December 22,\r\n2009.  However, Judge Arteaga did not sign the order granting the motion for new trial until January\r\n21, 2010.  <span>Relator contends the trial court\u2019s order granting the motion for new trial is void because\r\nthe trial court lacked jurisdiction. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>ANALYSIS</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Generally, mandamus will issue only to correct a clear abuse of discretion for which the\r\nrelator has no adequate remedy at law.  <i>In re Prudential Ins.

Therefore, mandamus relief is available to review the\r\norder granting a new trial that Jonathan contends is void. A timely filed motion for new trial is overruled by operation of law if the trial court does not\r\nsign a written order within seventy-five days after the date the judgment is signed. <span><span>Tex. R. Civ. P.\r\n</span></span><span>329b(c). </span> However, the trial court has plenary power to grant a new trial or to vacate, modify, correct,\r\nor reform the judgment for thirty days after the motion for new trial is overruled, either by a written\r\nand signed order or by operation of law, whichever occurs first.  <span><span>Tex.

R. Civ. P. </span></span><span>329b(c).</span>  The trial court\u2019s December 22, 2009 oral pronouncement granting the\r\nmotion for new trial that had already been overruled by operation of law was made within the trial\r\ncourt\u2019s plenary power.  <i>See</i> <span><span>Tex. R. Civ. P. </span></span><span>329b(e).</span>  However, because the trial court did not sign\r\nthe order until January 21, 2010, which was one hundred and eighteen days from the date of the\r\njudgment, it was outside the trial court\u2019s plenary power.  Therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction\r\nwhen it signed the order granting the motion for new trial and the order is void.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>In response to the petition for writ of mandamus, Natalie first asserts the Final Decree of\r\nDivorce is interlocutory and not final because it failed to dispose of all of the claims and parties to\r\nthe suit.  <i>See Kiefer v. Touris</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></span>, 300 (Tex. 2006); <i>Lehmann v.

As a result, Natalie contends that because the divorce decree was not\r\nfinal, the trial court retained plenary power to grant the new trial on January 21, 2010.  We disagree. \r\nNatalie contends the decree is interlocutory because it does not dispose of the issue of custody\r\nbecause it provides that both Jonathan and Natalie have the exclusive right to designate the primary\r\nresidence of the child without regard to geographic location.  However, the remainder of the divorce\r\ndecree clearly specifies the terms of possession.  Therefore, we conclude Natalie has not established\r\nthe order is interlocutory because it failed to dispose of all pending parties and claims.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Furthermore, Natalie responds that the petition should be denied because the trial court did\r\nnot have jurisdiction over any issues affecting the custody of the minor child N.Z. because Ohio had\r\ncontinuing jurisdiction over N.Z.  While we acknowledge Natalie\u2019s argument that Ohio had\r\ncontinuing jurisdiction, the issue has not been properly presented to this court.  <i>See Geary v. Peavy</i>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2410276\"><a href=\"/opinion/2410276/geary-v-peavy/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span>, 603-05 (Tex. 1994).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>CONCLUSION</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>We conclude the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion for new trial because\r\nthe order was signed after the trial court lost plenary power.  Accordingly, we conditionally grant the\r\nwrit of mandamus.  The trial court is ordered to vacate its January 21, 2010 order granting the new\r\ntrial.  <span>The writ will issue only if the trial court fails to comply within fourteen days.</span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>\u00a0</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>PER CURIAM</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
