Drilling USA,\r\nL.P., NDUSA Holdings Corporation, and Bruce Wilkinson arising out of his\r\nworkplace injury and his claim for workers\u2019 compensation.<span

summary judgment against Warnke disposing of\r\nall claims and all parties.<span>\u00a0 </span>Warnke\r\ncontends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because (1) Nabors and\r\nNDUSA Holdings failed to establish that they provided him with pre-injury notice\r\nof coverage and such notice is required for it to claim subscriber status under\r\nthe Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d); (2) a genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact existed whether Wilkinson was an independent contractor and\r\ntherefore covered under the Act\u2019s exclusive remedy provision; and (3) his\r\nclaims for injuries arising from Nabors\u2019s alleged fraudulent and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation constituted separate injuries from his on-the-job injury and\r\nfell outside the protection of the Act\u2019s exclusive remedy provision. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>We affirm in part, reverse in part,\r\nand remand for further proceedings.<span>\u00a0

co-worker, Bruce\r\nWilkinson, came free and crushed his hand.<span>\u00a0\r\n</span>In his affidavit, Warnke testified that his supervisor told him before\r\nhis injury that he was not covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance and that after\r\nhis injury an employee in Nabors\u2019s human resources department, Brandon Cannady,\r\ndenied Nabors\u2019s responsibility for Warnke\u2019s medical expenses.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span></span><span>\u00a0 </span>Warnke\u2019s wife testified by affidavit that\r\nCannady told her that Warnke was not a Nabors employee and Nabors would not\r\nprovide him workers\u2019 compensation coverage.<span>\u00a0\r\n</span>Warnke also alleged that Nabors and </span><span>NDUSA<span> Holdings never\r\nprovided him written notice of coverage under workers\u2019 compensation insurance\r\nbefore his injury.<span>\u00a0 </span>Eight months after\r\nthe accident and about three months after filing suit, Warnke began receiving workers\u2019\r\ncompensation benefits from Nabors\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. <p></p></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Warnke\r\nfiled suit against Nabors for negligence, fraud, and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation, against </span><span>NDUSA<span> Holdings for negligence,\r\nand against Wilkinson for negligence.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span></span><span>\u00a0 </span>In his original petition, Warnke claimed that\r\nhe and Wilkinson were both employees of Nabors.<span>\u00a0\r\n</span>He later amended his petition to plead in the alternative that Wilkinson\r\nwas an independent contractor.<span>\u00a0 </span><span>\u00a0</span><p></p></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>Nabors, </span><span>NDUSA<span>\r\nHoldings, and Wilkinson filed a traditional motion for summary judgment arguing\r\nthat no genuine issue of material fact existed because the Act\u2019s exclusive\r\nremedy provision bars Warnke\u2019s recovery.<span>\u00a0\r\n</span>Nabors, </span>NDUSA<span> Holdings,\r\nand Wilkinson argued that subscriber status does not depend on providing the\r\nemployee with pre-injury notice of coverage.<span>\u00a0\r\n</span>Nabors\u2014the only defendant sued for fraud and negligent misrepresentation\r\nclaims\u2014also asserted that the exclusive remedy provision barred Warnke\u2019s fraud\r\nand negligent misrepresentation claims.<span>\u00a0 </span>Warnke\r\nresponded that (1) Nabors and </span>NDUSA<span> Holdings were not subscribers because they failed to give Warnke notice\r\nof coverage and their insurance provider was not authorized to act in Texas;\r\n(2) a fact issue exists regarding whether Wilkinson was an independent\r\ncontractor and therefore not covered by the exclusive remedy provision; and (3)\r\nhis fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims arise from a separate injury\r\nfrom the on-the-job injury covered by the Act.<span>\u00a0\r\n</span>The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Nabors, </span>NDUSA<span> Holdings, and Wilkinson on all claims.<span>\u00a0
