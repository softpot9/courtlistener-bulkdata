Sellers further argues that his\n\nsentence is substantively unreasonable.\n\n      When reviewing a sentence imposed by a district court, we ordinarily must\n\nfirst ensure that the district court correctly calculated the guideline range. United\n\nStates v. Winingear, 422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir. 2005). We review a district\n\ncourt\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and \u201cits factual findings for clear\n\nerror.\u201d United States v. Vance, 494 F.3d 985, 994 (11th Cir. 2007). The quantity\n\nof drugs attributable to a defendant under the Guidelines is a question of fact that\n\nwe review for clear error. United States v. Rodriguez, 398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n      After determining that the district court correctly calculated the guideline\n\nrange, we then review the sentence for reasonableness in light of the factors set\n\nforth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). United States v. Martin, 455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th\n\nCir. 2006). The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under a deferential\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fabuse-of-discretion standard. United States v. Pugh, 515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th\n\nCir. 2008) (citing Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, ___, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597, 169\n\nL. Ed. 2d 445 (2007)). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, we will only\n\nreverse if the district court made a clear error in judgment. Pugh at 1191. The\n\nparty challenging the sentence ultimately \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the\n\nsentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section\n\n3553(a).\u201d United States v. Talley, 431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\n      A sentence may be reviewed for procedural or substantive unreasonableness.\n\nUnited States v. Hunt, 459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n.3 (11th Cir. 2006). A sentence is\n\nprocedurally unreasonable if the district court (1) improperly calculated the\n\nguidelines range, (2) selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, (3)\n\ntreated the Guidelines as mandatory, (4) failed to consider the \u00a7 3353(a) sentencing\n\nfactors, or (5) failed to adequately explain the reasons for the chosen sentence.\n\nGall, 552 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 597; United States v. Williams, 526 F.3d 1312,\n\n1322 (11th Cir. 2008). Where a district court has indicated that it would have\n\nimposed the same sentence regardless of a particular guidelines calculation,\n\nhowever, we may decline to decide a disputed guideline issue or remand the case\n\nfor new sentence proceedings where the guideline error, if any, did not affect the\n\nultimate sentence imposed. See United States v. Keene, 470 F.3d 1347, 1348\u201349\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f(11th Cir. 2006). Under such circumstances, we will, if necessary, proceed to\n\nexamine whether the defendant\u2019s sentence is reasonable in light of the guideline\n\nrange calculated without the procedural Guidelines error. Id. at 1349-50.\n\n      Substantive reasonableness is determined with reference to the factors listed\n\nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Williams, 526 F.3d at 1322. The statutory factors include:\n\n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics\n\nof the accused; (3) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\n\nrespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need for\n\ndeterrence; (5) the need to protect the public; (6) the kinds of sentences available;\n\n(7) the sentencing guidelines range; and (8) the need to avoid unwarranted\n\nsentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a);\n\nsee also Williams, 526 F.3d at 1322. We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of\n\nreasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and the fact that\n\nwe might reasonably conclude that a different sentence is appropriate is not\n\nsufficient to warrant reversal. Talley, 431 F.3d at 788; Williams, 526 F.3d at 1322.\n\n      Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Sellers has failed to\n\ncarry his burden of showing that the district court committed a clear error in\n\njudgment or that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Because the district\n\ncourt indicated that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of a\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fparticular guidelines calculation, any potential error was rendered harmless.\n\nAccordingly, we decline to address the drug quantity issue. For the above-stated\n\nreasons, we affirm Sellers\u2019s sentence.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                          [DO NOT PUBLISH]\n\n\n             IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                                                                    FILED\n                      FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT U.S. COURT OF APPEALS\n                        ________________________ ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                                          SEPTEMBER 23, 2009\n                              No. 08-16721                 THOMAS K.

Where a district court has indicated that it would have\n\nimposed the same sentence regardless of a particular guidelines calculation,\n\nhowever, we may decline to decide a disputed guideline issue or remand the case\n\nfor new sentence proceedings where the guideline error, if any, did not affect the\n\nultimate sentence imposed. See United States v. Keene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77513\"><a href=\"/opinion/77513/united-states-v-billy-jack-keene/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1348\u201349\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\f(11th Cir. 2006). Under such circumstances, we will, if necessary, proceed to\n\nexamine whether the defendant\u2019s sentence is reasonable in light of the guideline\n\nrange calculated without the procedural Guidelines error. Id. at 1349-50.\n\n      Substantive reasonableness is determined with reference to the factors listed\n\nin 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Williams, 526 F.3d at 1322. The statutory factors include:\n\n(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics\n\nof the accused; (3) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote\n\nrespect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need for\n\ndeterrence; (5) the need to protect the public; (6) the kinds of sentences available;\n\n(7) the sentencing guidelines range; and (8) the need to avoid unwarranted\n\nsentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a);\n\nsee also Williams, 526 F.3d at 1322. We have recognized that \u201cthere is a range of\n\nreasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and the fact that\n\nwe might reasonably conclude that a different sentence is appropriate is not\n\nsufficient to warrant reversal. Talley, 431 F.3d at 788; Williams, 526 F.3d at 1322.\n\n      Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Sellers has failed to\n\ncarry his burden of showing that the district court committed a clear error in\n\njudgment or that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Because the district\n\ncourt indicated that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of a\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\fparticular guidelines calculation, any potential error was rendered harmless.\n\nAccordingly, we decline to address the drug quantity issue. For the above-stated\n\nreasons, we affirm Sellers\u2019s sentence.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
