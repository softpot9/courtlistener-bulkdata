Wilking, Judge\n\nRepresenting Appellant:\n      Hampton M. Young, Jr., Attorney at Law, Casper, Wyoming\n\nRepresenting Appellee:\n      Amanda W. Wiley of Taylor \uf07c Anderson, LLP, Denver, Colorado\n\nBefore KITE, C.J., and HILL, VOIGT, BURKE, and DAVIS, JJ.\n\n\n\nNOTICE: This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in Pacific Reporter Third.\nReaders are requested to notify the Clerk of the Supreme Court, Supreme Court Building,\nCheyenne, Wyoming 82002, of any typographical or other formal errors so that correction may be\nmade before final publication in the permanent volume.\n\fDAVIS, Justice.\n\n[\u00b61] Appellant Kelvin Bourke sued his former employer Grey Wolf Drilling Company,\nLP, for fraud and wrongful termination in the Seventh Judicial District Court.\nUnbeknownst to Bourke, Grey Wolf had been sold to a foreign corporation, Precision\nDrilling, 1 which affected the venue of this action under Wyoming Statute \u00a7 1-5-107.\nPrecision Drilling was not a resident of Wyoming as Grey Wolf had been. Precision\nDrilling moved to dismiss the case for improper venue and failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. The district court granted the motion on both grounds.\n\n[\u00b62] Bourke claims that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for improper\nvenue, and that his claims were summarily dismissed when he should have been granted\nleave to amend his complaint. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for improper\nvenue, but we conclude that the court erred as a matter of law when it reached the merits\nof the case after determining that it had to be dismissed on venue grounds. We\naccordingly reverse and remand for entry of a dismissal without prejudice based only\nupon improper venue.\n\n                                             ISSUES\n\n[\u00b63]   Appellant states the issues as follows:\n\n               A. Whether the venue outlined in Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 1-5-107 is\n               mandatory, requiring a case filed in the improper County be\n               dismissed.\n\n               B. Whether or not the Court abused its discretion by denying\n               Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Amend.\n\n[\u00b64] We believe the issues are more aptly summarized as follows:\n\n               1. Was venue proper in Natrona County?\n\n               2. If venue was not proper, should the district court have\n               transferred the case to a proper venue?\n\n               3. Did the district court err as a matter of law in reaching the\n               merits of a motion to dismiss on W.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) grounds\n               after it determined that the case had to be dismissed on venue\n               grounds?\n\n1\n  Precision Drilling is identified as a limited partnership in the caption, but it is in fact a Texas\ncorporation.\n\n\n                                                  1\n\f                                        FACTS\n\n[\u00b65] Appellant Bourke lived in Carbon County and worked as a motorman on a drilling\nrig operated by Grey Wolf in Lincoln County. The rig\u2019s deck or floor hand did not report\nfor work on August 13, 2007, and Bourke had to perform his duties as well as his own.\nThe crew was \u201ctripping pipe\u201d that day, i.e., placing sections of drill pipe back into the\nwellbore after removing them. The sections of pipe weighed approximately one ton, and\nthey tended to swing as they were pulled up by the draw works (winch) in the derrick.\n\n[\u00b66] Bourke claims that he was hit by a joint of pipe and seriously injured because he\nwas required to work without assistance from the missing deck hand. He also contends\nthat he was not properly trained in the use of a \u201ctail rope\u201d used to control the pipe, and\nthat the tail rope was tied off so as to make it ineffective to prevent the pipe from\nswinging.\n\n[\u00b67] Bourke\u2019s complaint alleges that he reported the accident to Grey Wolf the day it\nhappened, that a worker\u2019s compensation report of injury was completed, and that he\nexpected the company to submit the report to the Wyoming Workers\u2019 Safety and\nCompensation Division (the Division). The company did not in fact submit a report of\ninjury to the Division at that time, and Bourke alleges that co-employee witnesses to the\nreport were told not to provide any statements concerning the claimed injury.\n\n[\u00b68] Bourke continued to work with no restrictions for several months after he claims\nhe was injured. Grey Wolf then fired Bourke for smoking in an unauthorized area on\nNovember 13, 2007. His complaint alleges that on December 3, 2007, Grey Wolf\nforwarded the form Bourke had filled out the day after the accident to the Division,\nnoting that it was \u201cunsure\u201d if he had been injured on the job or not. The Division denied\nthe claim.\n\n[\u00b69] Bourke filed suit in the Seventh Judicial District on August 8, 2011, five days\nbefore the statute of limitations for negligence and fraud found in Wyoming Statute \u00a7 1-\n3-105(a)(iv) would have expired. He alleged negligence against other rig workers named\nonly as \u201cDoes,\u201d and fraud and wrongful termination against Grey Wolf. None of the\ncoworkers were ever identified.\n\n[\u00b610] Service was attempted at the Casper address reflected in the Wyoming Secretary\nof State\u2019s records for the Grey Wolf limited partnership, but the company no longer had\nan office there because it had been bought out by Precision Drilling. Bourke amended his\ncomplaint to add Precision Drilling as a party, and then amended his complaint a second\ntime to allege additional facts regarding negligence and wrongful termination. He served\nPrecision Drilling\u2019s agent for process both times.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f[\u00b611] Precision Drilling responded by filing a motion to dismiss under Wyoming Rules\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) and 12(b)(6). It claimed that venue was improper under\nWyoming Statute \u00a7 1-5-1072 because Precision Drilling is a foreign corporation and\nBourke failed to file suit where he resided (Carbon County) or where the cause of action\narose (Lincoln County) as required by that statute. It also claimed that Bourke failed to\nstate a claim upon which relief could be granted because his fraud claim was not pled\nwith particularity, and because he failed to allege that he was fired for exercising a\nprotected right in his retaliatory discharge claim.\n\n[\u00b612] Bourke filed a response to the motion to dismiss and a motion for change of\nvenue. He asserted that the case should be transferred to a different venue under\nW.R.C.P. 40.1(a) rather than dismissed as Precision Drilling had asked if in fact it was\nimproperly venued. He also asked the court for leave to amend his complaint to cure the\ndeficiencies Precision Drilling identified, but he failed to file a proposed third amended\ncomplaint or to specify how he would amend the existing pleading in the motion for\nleave to amend.\n\n[\u00b613] The district court held a hearing on all motions, and ultimately entered a written\norder providing as follows: 3\n\n                1. Precision Drilling\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is Granted as it\n                relates to the arguments of Rule 12(b)(3). [Improper venue]\n\n                2. Precision Drilling\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is Granted as it\n                relates to the arguments of Rule 12(b)(6). Specifically, the\n                Court finds that Plaintiff failed to state claims for fraud and\n                retaliatory discharge.\n\n                3. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Change of Venue and Plaintiff\u2019s\n                Motion to Amend are Denied.\n\n                4. Judgment is hereby entered in favor of Defendant Precision\n                Drilling Company, LP, and against Plaintiff Kelvin Bourke.\n\n2\n  \u201cAn action, other than one (1) of those mentioned in W.S. 1-5-101 through 1-5-104, against a\nnonresident of this state or a foreign corporation, whether or not codefendants reside in Wyoming, may be\nbrought in any county where the cause of action arose or where the plaintiff resides.\u201d Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\n1-5-107 (LexisNexis 2013).\n3\n  At oral argument, counsel for Appellees contended that the court orally announced its decision in a\ndifferent sequence, ruling first on the merits of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion that Appellant\u2019s complaint failed\nto state a claim on which relief could be granted, and then ruling that venue was improper in Natrona\nCounty. Unfortunately, the only record of the hearing is the order itself, which reflects that the trial court\nfound that venue was improper and then reached the merits.\n\n\n                                                       3\n\fThis appeal was timely perfected.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[\u00b614] We generally review a district court\u2019s ruling on a request for a change of venue for\nan abuse of discretion, meaning that we will affirm the district court where it could have\nreasonably concluded as it did. See, e.g., Sundance Mountain Resort, Inc. v. Union Tel.\nCo., 2007 WY 11, \u00b6 7, 150 P.3d 191, 194\u201395 (Wyo. 2007); Burnham v. Coffinberry,\n2003 WY 109, \u00b6 5, 76 P.3d 296, 298 (Wyo. 2003); McGhee v. Rork, 978 P.2d 577, 579\n(Wyo. 1999); Little v. Kobos ex rel. Kobos, 877 P.2d 752, 757\u201358 (Wyo. 1994); In re\nWilson\u2019s Estate, 397 P.2d 805, 810 (Wyo. 1964).\n\n[\u00b615] This case also requires that we interpret Wyoming\u2019s venue statutes and determine\nother legal issues. We review questions of law de novo without deference to the district\ncourt\u2019s determinations. In re MN, 2007 WY 189, \u00b6 4, 171 P.3d 1077, 1080 (Wyo. 2007)\n(citation omitted).\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\nPropriety of Dismissing for Lack of Venue\n\n       Permissive or Mandatory Nature of \u00a7 1-5-107\n\n[\u00b616] In civil cases, venue \u201crefers to the county, district, or other geographical location\nin which, for the sake of fairness, convenience, or other commanding policy\nconsiderations, a cause is to be tried.\u201d State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Kunz, 2008 WY\n71, \u00b6 14, 186 P.3d 378, 382 (Wyo. 2008) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n[\u00b617] Bourke argues that \u00a7 1-5-107 is a \u201cpermissive\u201d venue statute, meaning that the two\npossible venues listed in the statute are not exclusive. He points out that certain venue\nstatutes require that specific types of actions \u201cshall\u201d be brought in particular counties.\nSee, e.g., Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-5-101 (LexisNexis 2013) (actions for recovery, partition or\nsale of real property under a mortgage, lien or encumbrance); \u00a7 1-5-104 (actions for\nrecovery of a fine, against a public officer, or on the bond or undertaking of a public\nofficer); \u00a7 1-5-108 (actions not otherwise provided for), and \u00a7 26-15-134 (cause of action\nagainst an insurer). Other venue statutes provide that a cause of action \u201cmay\u201d be brought\nin certain counties. See, e.g., \u00a7 1-5-102 (action may be brought in any county where real\nproperty is located if it is situated in more than one county); \u00a7 1-5-103 (action for specific\nperformance of a contract for sale of realty may be brought where any defendant resides);\n\u00a7 1-5-105 (action against domestic corporation may be brought where the corporation is\n\u201csituate\u201d or has its principal office or place of business); \u00a7 1-5-106 (action against a\n\n\n                                               4\n\fpublic carrier or railroad may be brought in any county through or into which the carrier\nor rail line passes). Bourke therefore contends that \u00a7 1-5-107 merely suggests\nappropriate counties where an action could be filed, but in fact means that the action\ncould have been filed in any county because of the use of the word \u201cmay.\u201d\n\n[\u00b618] We have previously said that the word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive, while \u201cshall\u201d is\nmandatory. Anderson v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Teton Cnty., 2009 WY 122, \u00b6 22, 217\nP.3d 401, 407 (Wyo. 2009); MN, \u00b6 5, 171 P.3d at 1080. A comparison of the \u201cmay\u201d and\n\u201cshall\u201d venue provisions reveals a clear distinction, however\u2013in the comparatively few\n\u201cshall be brought\u201d provisions, an action can only be brought in one county. For example,\nan action to recover, partition or foreclose upon real property can only be brought in the\ncounty in which the real property is located. \u00a7 1-5-101. On the other hand, actions\nagainst nonresidents and foreign corporations \u201cmay be brought\u201d in either of two places\u2013\nwhere the cause of action arose or where the plaintiff resides. \u00a7 1-5-107.\n\n[\u00b619] As we have often stated:\n\n             In interpreting statutes, our primary consideration is to\n             determine the legislature\u2019s intent. All statutes must be\n             construed in pari materia and, in ascertaining the meaning of\n             a given law, all statutes relating to the same subject or having\n             the same general purpose must be considered and construed\n             in harmony. Statutory construction is a question of law, so\n             our standard of review is de novo. We endeavor to interpret\n             statutes in accordance with the legislature\u2019s intent. We begin\n             by making an inquiry respecting the ordinary and obvious\n             meaning of the words employed according to their\n             arrangement and connection. We construe the statute as a\n             whole, giving effect to every word, clause, and sentence, and\n             we construe all parts of the statute in pari materia. When a\n             statute is sufficiently clear and unambiguous, we give effect\n             to the plain and ordinary meaning of the words and do not\n             resort to the rules of statutory construction. Moreover, we\n             must not give a statute a meaning that will nullify its\n             operation if it is susceptible of another interpretation.\n\n                    Moreover, we will not enlarge, stretch, expand, or\n             extend a statute to matters that do not fall within its express\n             provisions.\n\n                    Only if we determine the language of a statute is\n             ambiguous will we proceed to the next step, which involves\n             applying general principles of statutory construction to the\n\n\n                                             5\n\f              language of the statute in order to construe any ambiguous\n              language to accurately reflect the intent of the legislature. If\n              this Court determines that the language of the statute is not\n              ambiguous, there is no room for further construction. We\n              will apply the language of the statute using its ordinary and\n              obvious meaning.\n\n                      Whether a statute is ambiguous is a question of law. A\n              statute is unambiguous if reasonable persons are able to agree\n              as to its meaning with consistency and predictability, while a\n              statute is ambiguous if it is vague or uncertain and subject to\n              varying interpretations.\n\nRock v. Lankford, 2013 WY 61, \u00b6 20, 301 P.3d 1075, 1080\u201381 (Wyo. 2013) (quoting\nRedco Const. v. Profile Props., LLC, 2012 WY 24, \u00b6 26, 271 P.3d 408, 415\u201316 (Wyo.\n2012)).\n\n[\u00b620] We find Wyoming Statute \u00a7 1-5-107 to be unambiguous. It is permissive only to\nthe extent of allowing a plaintiff to choose between filing an action where the cause of\naction arose or where he resides. See Moonlit Waters Apts. Inc. v. Cauley, 666 So.2d\n898, 900 (Fla. 1996) (\u201cUnder the principle of statutory construction, expressio unius est\nexclusio alterius, the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another.\u201d); Radalj v.\nUnion Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 59 Wyo. 140, 176\u201377, 138 P.2d 984, 996 (1943) (\u201cThere is an\nold maxim \u2018noscitur a sociis\u2019 (it is known by its associates)\u201d). Cf. United States v.\nCeballos-Martinez, 371 F.3d 713, 715\u201317 (10th Cir. 2004) (holding that Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 4(c)(1), which provides two options by which a prisoner may prove\na timely notice of appeal, only authorizes those two methods of proving timely\ncompliance).\n\n[\u00b621] We are further reinforced in this conclusion by the presumption that our legislature\nacts in a reasonable and thoughtful manner. Rock, \u00b6 39, 301 P.3d at 1085 (citing Redco\nConst., \u00b6 37, 271 P.3d at 418). If the legislature had intended that an action could be\nbrought anywhere unless it fell within the scope of a \u201cshall be brought\u201d statute, it would\nnot have passed several statutes specifying where an action may be brought. The\nlegislature would simply have listed the relatively few actions which had to be initiated in\nonly one county and said that \u201call other actions may be brought in any county in the\nstate.\u201d The Court does not perceive the legislature to intend to suggest possible venues,\nbut rather to specify the \u201cgeographical location[s] in which, for the sake of fairness,\nconvenience, or other commanding policy considerations, a cause is to be tried.\u201d Kunz, \u00b6\n14, 186 P.3d at 382 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n[\u00b622] In this case, \u00a7 1-5-107 authorized Bourke to file his complaint in one of two\npossible venues: Carbon County, where Bourke resided, or Lincoln County, where the\n\n\n                                              6\n\fcause of action arose. We cannot read \u00a7 1-5-107 so broadly as to authorize the filing of a\ncomplaint in any county in the state. We therefore conclude that the district court\nproperly determined that Natrona County was not a proper venue because the cause of\naction did not arise there, and Bourke resides in Carbon County.\n\n          Propriety of Dismissal\n\n[\u00b623] Bourke also argues that even if venue was not proper in Natrona County, the case\nshould have been transferred rather than dismissed. He relies upon Matter of Larsen, 770\nP.2d 1089 (Wyo. 1989), for the proposition that \u201c[u]nless specifically mandated by\nstatute, the absence of proper venue does not result in a dismissal . . . .\u201d Id. at 1092\n(citing Sil-Flo Corp. v. Bowen, 402 P.2d 22, 27 (Ariz. 1965)).\n\n[\u00b624] Precision Drilling responds that it was well within the discretion of the district\ncourt to dismiss this case for improper venue under W.R.C.P. 12(b)(3). It also contends\nthat \u201cPlaintiff was never entitled to a change of venue. If entitlement was the policy, a\nplaintiff could file an action without regard to venue and would then be entitled to move\nit to the proper venue whenever he fancied.\u201d\n\n[\u00b625] We think the issue is somewhat simpler than either party makes it out to be.\nMatter of Larsen was a case with a complicated procedural history which is of little value\nin analyzing the issue presented here. Larsen was injured in a vehicle rollover in\nCampbell County and timely filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits in the\ndistrict court for that county. Larsen, 770 P.2d at 1090. At the time, worker\u2019s\ncompensation claims were required to be filed with the clerk of the district court in the\ncounty where the injury occurred, and so Larsen filed in the right place. Wyo. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7 27-12-601(a) (June 1983), repealed by 1986 Wyo. Sess. Laws Sp. Sess., ch. 3 \u00a7 3. The\napplicable statute also provided that the employer or employee could request a transfer of\nvenue to the county in which the employer was based or the employee lived after it was\nproperly filed in the county in which the injury occurred.4\n\n\n\n4\n    This former provision read as follows:\n\n                  (b) At any time after the employee files his claim, he may request that\n                  the case and entire file be transferred to the district court of the county in\n                  which he resides. At any time after the employer has filed the\n                  employer\u2019s report of injury, he may request that the case and entire file\n                  be transferred to the district court of the county in which his main office\n                  in Wyoming is located. . . . If no objection is filed within ten (10) days\n                  after notice has been mailed, or if both parties request transfer of the case\n                  to the same district court, the clerk shall make proper notation in the\n                  docket and forward the entire file to the district court requested.\n\n\n\n                                                         7\n\f[\u00b626] Larsen moved to transfer the case to the Eighth Judicial District. Hall\nConstruction did not object, and the Sixth Judicial District judge attempted to transfer the\ncase. The Eighth Judicial District judge returned the case to the Sixth Judicial District\nwithout being asked to do so by either party or entering an order formally transferring it\nback. The Sixth Judicial District judge then granted summary judgment to the employer\nand again attempted to return the case to the Eighth Judicial District. Larson, 770 P.2d at\n1090\u201391.\n\n[\u00b627] On appeal, Larsen argued that the Sixth Judicial District lacked subject matter\njurisdiction to hear the case because procedures required to transfer the case back from\nthe Eighth Judicial District were not followed. Larsen, 770 P.2d at 1090\u201391. This Court\ndistinguished the concepts of venue and subject matter jurisdiction:\n\n                       The district courts in this state are courts of general\n               jurisdiction. As such, they have inherent subject matter\n               jurisdiction over any and all cases in which jurisdiction is not\n               specifically vested in some court of limited jurisdiction. This\n               jurisdiction includes jurisdiction over worker\u2019s compensation\n               claims and disputes such as the one in this case. Once\n               jurisdiction is acquired, the district court has the power to\n               hear and determine the matter and to render a binding\n               ju d g m e n t . W e a d o p t t h e a n a l y s i s f o u n d i n Sil-Flo\n               Corporation v. Bowen, 98 Ariz. 77, 402 P.2d 22 (1965), and\n               recognize that the power to enter a binding judgment is\n               equally present among all district courts in the state. In this\n               context, venue is never a consideration.\n\nLarsen, 770 P.2d at 1092 (additional citations omitted).\n\n[\u00b628] This Larsen opinion also included the following dicta on which Bourke relies:\n\n               It is proper . . . to remind our district courts and counsel that\n               the remedy with respect to questions of venue is a request to\n               change venue to the proper court. Unless specifically\n               mandated by statute, the absence of proper venue does not\n               result in a dismissal, a reversal, or a new trial. See Sil-Flo,\n               402 P.2d at 27. Furthermore, we expect the aggrieved party\n\n\n\nId. at \u00a7 601(b). Wyoming adopted an administrative system for adjudication of worker\u2019s compensation\nclaims in 1986. See 1986 Wyo. Sess. Laws Sp. Sess., ch. 3 \u00a7 3 (repealing and recreating former \u00a7\u00a7 27-\n12-101 through -805 as the current \u00a7\u00a7 27-14-101 through -804).\n\n\n                                                    8\n\f                  to make a timely objection, or to request a change.\n                  Otherwise, venue will be deemed proper.\n\nId. at 1092.\n\n[\u00b629] As the above excerpt shows, Larsen relied on the Arizona case of Sil-Flo v. Bowen\nin concluding that improper venue does not normally warrant a dismissal, but that the\ncase should instead be transferred. In Sil-Flo, the Arizona Supreme Court applied\nArizona Revised Statute \u00a7 12-404, which specifically provides for transfer of improperly\nvenued cases.5 The Sil-Flo Court held that \u201c[w]here venue of an action has been\nimproperly laid, the remedy of the party complaining of the error in venue is not\ndismissal of the action, but is to seek its removal to the court having the proper venue\nunder the proceduer [sic] set forth in A.R.S. \u00a7 12-404.\u201d Sil-Flo, 402 P.2d at 27.\n\n[\u00b630] Title 28, Section 1406(a) of the United States Code also contains a venue transfer\nprovision. It authorizes federal district courts to dismiss or transfer an improperly venued\ncase \u201cif it be in the interest of justice . . . .\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (2012). See also id. at \u00a7\n1404(a) (\u201cFor the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district\ncourt may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have\nbeen brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\u201d). Federal\ncourts do not favor dismissal of improperly venued cases, and federal case law holds that\nthe \u201cpreferred disposition is to transfer the action to a district in which it might have been\nbrought in the first place.\u201d 17 James Wm.

If an action is not brought in the proper county, the court shall\n                  nevertheless have jurisdiction and may hear and determine the action\n                  unless the defendant, before expiration of the time allowed to answer,\n                  files with the clerk of the court in which the action is brought an affidavit\n                  of the defendant, his agent or attorney, stating that the county in which\n                  the action is brought is not the proper county and stating the county of\n                  the defendant\u2019s residence, and praying that the action be transferred to\n                  the proper county.\n\n                  B. A copy of the affidavit shall be served upon plaintiff, and unless the\n                  affidavit is controverted under oath, within five days after service, the\n                  court shall order the action transferred to the proper county.\n\n                  C. If the affidavit is controverted, the court shall hear the issue thus\n                  presented and shall order the action retained in the court in which it is\n                  brought, or transferred to the proper county.\n\nAriz.

Time\nWarner, 997 F.2d 1023, 1026\u201327 (2d Cir. 1993)).\n\n[\u00b631] However, Wyoming does not have a statute authorizing transfer of cases which\nhave been filed in an improper venue. The transfer statute that played a part in the\nLarsen decision applied only to workers\u2019 compensation claims filed in the proper venue,\nand it has been repealed. Bourke has not directed us to any common law power which\nwould permit or require a district court to transfer such a case either. The district judge\ndid not err in dismissing the case in the absence of any authority to do otherwise.\n\n[\u00b632] In the district court, Bourke relied on W.R.C.P. 40.1(a), which authorizes a\ntransfer of the place of trial under the following circumstances:\n\n                (1) The court upon motion of any party made within 15 days\n                after the last pleading is filed shall transfer the action to\n                another county for trial if the court is satisfied that there exists\n                within the county where the action is pending such prejudice\n                against the party or the party\u2019s cause that the party cannot\n                obtain a fair and impartial trial, or that the convenience of\n                witnesses would be promoted thereby. . . .\n                                             . . .\n                (3) The presiding judge may at any time upon the judge\u2019s\n                own motion order a transfer of trial when it appears that the\n                ends of justice would be promoted thereby.\n\nW.R.C.P. 40.1(a).\n\n[\u00b633] Bourke did not argue in this appeal that Rule 40.1(a)(1) or (3) required a transfer\nrather than a dismissal. That contention has therefore been abandoned, and we do not\naddress it.6 We note in passing that the rule does not by its terms apply to cases in which\nsuit has been filed in the wrong venue, but rather to transfer of trial when fairness\nrequires that the case be tried elsewhere. Nothing in this record suggests that this case\ncould not have been tried fairly in Natrona County, venue issues notwithstanding.\n\n6\n  See, e.g., Bedessem v. Cunningham, 2012 WY 36, \u00b6 12, 272 P.3d 310, 312 (Wyo. 2012) (claims of an\nimplied easement abandoned on appeal); Teniente v.

Wyoming\u2019s legislature\npresumably anticipated this problem when it passed Wyoming Statute \u00a7 1-3-118,\ncommonly known as the \u201csavings statute\u201d:\n\n                     If in an action commenced in due time a judgment for\n              the plaintiff is reversed, or if the plaintiff fails otherwise than\n              upon the merits and the time limited for the commencement\n              of the action has expired at the date of the reversal or failure,\n              the plaintiff, or his representatives if he dies and if the cause\n              of action survives, may commence a new action within one\n              (1) year after the date of the failure or reversal. This\n              provision also applies to any claim asserted in any pleading\n              by a defendant.\n\nWyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-3-118 (LexisNexis 2013).\n\n[\u00b635] A dismissal for improper venue is not an adjudication on the merits and should be\nwithout prejudice. W.R.C.P. 41(b)(1) (\u201cUnless the court in its order for dismissal\notherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and any dismissal not provided for\nin this rule, other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or for\nfailure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.\u201d);\nBarkwell v. Chatterton, 4 Wyo. 307, 312\u201313, 33 P. 940, 941 (1893); 2 Moore et al.,\nsupra, at \u00a7 12.32[5] (citation omitted).\n\n[\u00b636] If the claims against him had been dismissed without prejudice, Bourke would\nhave been entitled to refile his complaint in an appropriate venue if he did so within the\ntime allowed by \u00a7 1-3-118. Such a result would strike an appropriate balance between a\n\u201cplaintiff\u2019s obligation to institute his action in a permissible forum,\u201d and the \u201cunfairness\nof barring a plaintiff\u2019s action solely because a prior timely action is dismissed for\nimproper venue after the applicable statute of limitations has run.\u201d See Burnham, \u00b6 5, 76\nP.3d at 298 (quoting 5A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and\nProcedure Civil \u00a7 1352, at 263\u201365 (1990)); Burnett v. N.Y. Cent. R. Co., 380 U.S. 424,\n430, 85 S. Ct. 1050, 1055, 13 L. Ed. 2d 941 (1965).\n\nDenial of Motion for Leave to Amend and Dismissal on the Merits\n\n[\u00b637] However, the district court also dismissed Bourke\u2019s complaint based on failure to\nstate a claim upon which relief could be granted under W.R.C.P. 12(b)(6). Under\nW.R.C.P. 41(b)(1), a dismissal for failure to state a claim is a dismissal on the merits, and\n\n\n                                               11\n\fit is with prejudice, unless the court otherwise specifies. 7 The district court entered a\njudgment against Bourke, and we believe the court clearly intended to rule on the merits\nand to dismiss with prejudice. Bourke could not therefore simply refile in the correct\nvenue as he could have under the savings statute if the dismissal had been without\nprejudice based only upon improper venue.\n\n[\u00b638] This result requires us to determine whether a district court may reach the merits\nof a controversy after concluding that it must be dismissed because it is improperly\nvenued. This issue was not developed below, but \u201c[w]e are at liberty to decide a case\nupon any point which in our opinion the ends of justice require.\u201d In re WJH, 2001 WY\n54, \u00b6 48, 24 P.3d 1147, 1160 (Wyo. 2001) (quoting Allen v. Allen, 550 P.2d 1137, 1142\n(Wyo. 1976)).\n\n[\u00b639] The seminal case on this issue is Arrowsmith v. United Press International, 320\nF.2d 219 (2d Cir. 1963), a case in which a \u201cfat cat financier\u201d sued a press dispatching\ncompany for libel. The company filed a consolidated motion to dismiss for improper\nvenue, lack of personal jurisdiction, and failure of the complaint to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. The district court dismissed for failure to state a claim, but\ndid not decide the challenges to venue and jurisdiction. Id. at 220\u201321. Judge Friendly,\nwriting on behalf of the Second Circuit, held as follows:\n\n                     We all agree it was error for the district court to\n                proceed as it did. Not only does logic compel initial\n\n7\n  The language of W.R.C.P. 41(b)(1) is practically identical to that of its federal counterpart, F.R.C.P.\n41(b), and we find federal authority in this area highly persuasive. The Federal Practice & Procedure\ntreatise explains the operative effect of a dismissal for failure to state a claim as follows:\n\n                As is stated clearly in the rule, and the extensive case law under the\n                subdivision, a dismissal under Rule 41(b) or any other dismissal not\n                provided for in Rule 41 will operate as an adjudication on the merits\n                unless the district court otherwise specifies or the dismissal is for lack of\n                personal or subject matter jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join\n                a party under Rule 19.3 Thus, because an involuntary dismissal is an\n                adjudication on the merits, it is, in the phrase commonly used by the\n                federal courts, \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d\n                                                  . . .\n\n                Dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief\n                can be granted ordinarily are deemed to be an adjudication on the merits,\n                . . . a dismissal with prejudice.\n\n9 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2373 (3d ed. 2008)\n(footnotes omitted). See also 2 Moore et al., supra, at \u00a7 12.34[6][a] (\u201cA dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim is a judgment on the merits . . . . This type of dismissal, presumed to be with prejudice unless the\norder explicitly states otherwise, has a claim preclusive effect.\u201d) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n                                                      12\n\f              consideration of the issue of jurisdiction over the defendant\u2014\n              a court without such jurisdiction lacks power to dismiss a\n              complaint for failure to state a claim\u2014but the functional\n              difference that flows from the ground selected for dismissal\n              likewise compels considering jurisdiction and venue\n              questions first. A dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or\n              improper venue does not preclude a subsequent action in an\n              appropriate forum, whereas a dismissal for failure to state a\n              claim upon which relief can be granted is with prejudice. We\n              shall therefore vacate the judgment dismissing the complaint\n              for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and\n              remand the case for consideration of the issue of jurisdiction\n              over the person of the defendant and, in the event that this be\n              found, the issue of venue, prior to consideration of the merits.\n\nId. at 221 (footnote omitted).\n\n[\u00b640] We agree with Arrowsmith and its progeny that courts should decide preliminary\nchallenges to jurisdiction and venue before reaching the merits of a controversy. See id.;\nMadara v. Hall, 916 F.2d 1510, 1514 n.1 (11th Cir. 1990); United States v. $95,945.18,\nU.S. Currency, 913 F.2d 1106, 1107 (4th Cir. 1990); Sherman v. Am.

App. Aug. 28, 2000)\n(unpublished opinion).\n\n[\u00b641] The cases just cited did not involve situations in which a court dismissed a case\nbased on improper venue and then reached the merits, but we believe the common-sense\nrule in Arrowsmith precludes doing both. If a court concludes that a case must be\ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, it has determined that the\ncase cannot proceed in that jurisdiction or venue, i.e., that it should not be decided there.\nSee Wyrough, 376 F.2d at 547 (\u201c[T]here also exists a strong policy to conserve judicial\ntime and effort; preliminary matters such as defective service, personal jurisdiction and\nvenue should be raised and disposed of before the court considers the merits or quasi-\nmerits of a controversy.\u201d); Basile, 717 F. Supp. 2d at 385 (\u201c[I]t is hornbook law that\nvenue and personal jurisdiction are threshold procedural issues to be decided before the\nsubstantive grounds in a motion to dismiss.\u201d). A rule that would allow a court to decide\nthat it could not resolve a case on the merits and then do exactly that would make little\nsense. See 9 Wright & Miller, supra, at \u00a7 2373 (\u201c[T]he district court cannot make its\norder an adjudication on the merits if it lacks the power to decide the merits.\u201d).\n\n\n                                              13\n\f[\u00b642] For the reasons stated, we will vacate the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal,\nand reverse and remand for an order dismissing without prejudice on venue grounds\nalone.8\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n[\u00b643] We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for improper venue. However, we find its\nRule 12(b)(6) dismissal on the merits to be improper as a matter of law, and we therefore\nvacate that portion of its order and remand for a dismissal without prejudice based upon\nimproper venue.\n\n\n\n\n8\n At oral argument, counsel were asked whether Appellee\u2019s request that the district court reach the merits,\nor its defense of the district court\u2019s ruling on the merits in this appeal, waived Appellee\u2019s objection to\nvenue. W.R.C.P. 12(g) provides that \u201c[a] party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any\nother motions herein provided for and then available to the party.\u201d It was therefore clearly proper for\nAppellee to include a challenge to venue and a challenge to the adequacy of Bourke\u2019s pleadings in the\nsame motion.\n         However, an argument could be made that once the case was found to be improperly venued,\nseeking a dismissal on the merits was in fact a request that the court exercise authority to decide the case,\neffectively waiving an objection to venue. This issue was not briefed in the appeal, and neither counsel\nconceded or contended that the objection to venue was waived when they were asked about that\npossibility at oral argument. We therefore do not evaluate the possibility that submitting an order\nimplementing or defending a ruling on the merits of a claim might waive a challenge to venue. This\ndecision does, of course, hand Appellee a Pyrrhic victory if Bourke decides to pursue his claims in a\nproper venue, with a redrafted complaint, effectively requiring it to challenge his pleadings all over again\nbefore a different judge.\n\n\n                                                      14\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">               IN THE SUPREME COURT, STATE OF WYOMING\n\n                                        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WY</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n                                                                APRIL TERM, A.D. 2013\n\n                                                                         July 31, 2013\n\nKELVIN BOURKE,\n\nAppellant\n(Plaintiff),\n\nv.\n                                                     S-12-0258\nGREY WOLF DRILLING\nCOMPANY, LP, now known as\nPRECISION DRILLING COMPANY,\nLP,\n\nAppellee\n(Defendant).\n\n\n                    Appeal from the District Court of Natrona County\n                      The Honorable Catherine E.

Precision\nDrilling moved to dismiss the case for improper venue and failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. The district court granted the motion on both grounds.\n\n[\u00b62] Bourke claims that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for improper\nvenue, and that his claims were summarily dismissed when he should have been granted\nleave to amend his complaint. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for improper\nvenue, but we conclude that the court erred as a matter of law when it reached the merits\nof the case after determining that it had to be dismissed on venue grounds. We\naccordingly reverse and remand for entry of a dismissal without prejudice based only\nupon improper venue.\n\n                                             ISSUES\n\n[\u00b63]   Appellant states the issues as follows:\n\n               A. Whether the venue outlined in Wyo. Stat. \u00a7 1-5-107 is\n               mandatory, requiring a case filed in the improper County be\n               dismissed.\n\n               B. Whether or not the Court abused its discretion by denying\n               Plaintiff\u2019s Motion to Amend.\n\n[\u00b64] We believe the issues are more aptly summarized as follows:\n\n               1. Was venue proper in Natrona County?\n\n               2. If venue was not proper, should the district court have\n               transferred the case to a proper venue?\n\n               3. Did the district court err as a matter of law in reaching the\n               merits of a motion to dismiss on W.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) grounds\n               after it determined that the case had to be dismissed on venue\n               grounds?\n\n1\n  Precision Drilling is identified as a limited partnership in the caption, but it is in fact a Texas\ncorporation.\n\n\n                                                  1\n\f                                        FACTS\n\n[\u00b65] Appellant Bourke lived in Carbon County and worked as a motorman on a drilling\nrig operated by Grey Wolf in Lincoln County. The rig\u2019s deck or floor hand did not report\nfor work on August 13, 2007, and Bourke had to perform his duties as well as his own.\nThe crew was \u201ctripping pipe\u201d that day, i.e., placing sections of drill pipe back into the\nwellbore after removing them. The sections of pipe weighed approximately one ton, and\nthey tended to swing as they were pulled up by the draw works (winch) in the derrick.\n\n[\u00b66] Bourke claims that he was hit by a joint of pipe and seriously injured because he\nwas required to work without assistance from the missing deck hand. He also contends\nthat he was not properly trained in the use of a \u201ctail rope\u201d used to control the pipe, and\nthat the tail rope was tied off so as to make it ineffective to prevent the pipe from\nswinging.\n\n[\u00b67] Bourke\u2019s complaint alleges that he reported the accident to Grey Wolf the day it\nhappened, that a worker\u2019s compensation report of injury was completed, and that he\nexpected the company to submit the report to the Wyoming Workers\u2019 Safety and\nCompensation Division (the Division). The company did not in fact submit a report of\ninjury to the Division at that time, and Bourke alleges that co-employee witnesses to the\nreport were told not to provide any statements concerning the claimed injury.\n\n[\u00b68] Bourke continued to work with no restrictions for several months after he claims\nhe was injured. Grey Wolf then fired Bourke for smoking in an unauthorized area on\nNovember 13, 2007. His complaint alleges that on December 3, 2007, Grey Wolf\nforwarded the form Bourke had filled out the day after the accident to the Division,\nnoting that it was \u201cunsure\u201d if he had been injured on the job or not. The Division denied\nthe claim.\n\n[\u00b69] Bourke filed suit in the Seventh Judicial District on August 8, 2011, five days\nbefore the statute of limitations for negligence and fraud found in Wyoming Statute \u00a7 1-\n3-105(a)(iv) would have expired. He alleged negligence against other rig workers named\nonly as \u201cDoes,\u201d and fraud and wrongful termination against Grey Wolf. None of the\ncoworkers were ever identified.\n\n[\u00b610] Service was attempted at the Casper address reflected in the Wyoming Secretary\nof State\u2019s records for the Grey Wolf limited partnership, but the company no longer had\nan office there because it had been bought out by Precision Drilling. Bourke amended his\ncomplaint to add Precision Drilling as a party, and then amended his complaint a second\ntime to allege additional facts regarding negligence and wrongful termination. He served\nPrecision Drilling\u2019s agent for process both times.\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f[\u00b611] Precision Drilling responded by filing a motion to dismiss under Wyoming Rules\nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(3) and 12(b)(6). It claimed that venue was improper under\nWyoming Statute \u00a7 1-5-1072 because Precision Drilling is a foreign corporation and\nBourke failed to file suit where he resided (Carbon County) or where the cause of action\narose (Lincoln County) as required by that statute. It also claimed that Bourke failed to\nstate a claim upon which relief could be granted because his fraud claim was not pled\nwith particularity, and because he failed to allege that he was fired for exercising a\nprotected right in his retaliatory discharge claim.\n\n[\u00b612] Bourke filed a response to the motion to dismiss and a motion for change of\nvenue. He asserted that the case should be transferred to a different venue under\nW.R.C.P. 40.1(a) rather than dismissed as Precision Drilling had asked if in fact it was\nimproperly venued. He also asked the court for leave to amend his complaint to cure the\ndeficiencies Precision Drilling identified, but he failed to file a proposed third amended\ncomplaint or to specify how he would amend the existing pleading in the motion for\nleave to amend.\n\n[\u00b613] The district court held a hearing on all motions, and ultimately entered a written\norder providing as follows: 3\n\n                1. Precision Drilling\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is Granted as it\n                relates to the arguments of Rule 12(b)(3). [Improper venue]\n\n                2. Precision Drilling\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is Granted as it\n                relates to the arguments of Rule 12(b)(6). Specifically, the\n                Court finds that Plaintiff failed to state claims for fraud and\n                retaliatory discharge.\n\n                3. Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Change of Venue and Plaintiff\u2019s\n                Motion to Amend are Denied.\n\n                4. Judgment is hereby entered in favor of Defendant Precision\n                Drilling Company, LP, and against Plaintiff Kelvin Bourke.\n\n2\n  \u201cAn action, other than one (1) of those mentioned in W.S. 1-5-101 through 1-5-104, against a\nnonresident of this state or a foreign corporation, whether or not codefendants reside in Wyoming, may be\nbrought in any county where the cause of action arose or where the plaintiff resides.\u201d Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\n1-5-107 (LexisNexis 2013).\n3\n  At oral argument, counsel for Appellees contended that the court orally announced its decision in a\ndifferent sequence, ruling first on the merits of the Rule 12(b)(6) motion that Appellant\u2019s complaint failed\nto state a claim on which relief could be granted, and then ruling that venue was improper in Natrona\nCounty. Unfortunately, the only record of the hearing is the order itself, which reflects that the trial court\nfound that venue was improper and then reached the merits.\n\n\n                                                       3\n\fThis appeal was timely perfected.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[\u00b614] We generally review a district court\u2019s ruling on a request for a change of venue for\nan abuse of discretion, meaning that we will affirm the district court where it could have\nreasonably concluded as it did.

He points out that certain venue\nstatutes require that specific types of actions \u201cshall\u201d be brought in particular counties.\nSee, e.g., Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 1-5-101 (LexisNexis 2013) (actions for recovery, partition or\nsale of real property under a mortgage, lien or encumbrance); \u00a7 1-5-104 (actions for\nrecovery of a fine, against a public officer, or on the bond or undertaking of a public\nofficer); \u00a7 1-5-108 (actions not otherwise provided for), and \u00a7 26-15-134 (cause of action\nagainst an insurer). Other venue statutes provide that a cause of action \u201cmay\u201d be brought\nin certain counties. See, e.g., \u00a7 1-5-102 (action may be brought in any county where real\nproperty is located if it is situated in more than one county); \u00a7 1-5-103 (action for specific\nperformance of a contract for sale of realty may be brought where any defendant resides);\n\u00a7 1-5-105 (action against domestic corporation may be brought where the corporation is\n\u201csituate\u201d or has its principal office or place of business); \u00a7 1-5-106 (action against a\n\n\n                                               4\n\fpublic carrier or railroad may be brought in any county through or into which the carrier\nor rail line passes). Bourke therefore contends that \u00a7 1-5-107 merely suggests\nappropriate counties where an action could be filed, but in fact means that the action\ncould have been filed in any county because of the use of the word \u201cmay.\u201d\n\n[\u00b618] We have previously said that the word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive, while \u201cshall\u201d is\nmandatory.

A comparison of the \u201cmay\u201d and\n\u201cshall\u201d venue provisions reveals a clear distinction, however\u2013in the comparatively few\n\u201cshall be brought\u201d provisions, an action can only be brought in one county. For example,\nan action to recover, partition or foreclose upon real property can only be brought in the\ncounty in which the real property is located. \u00a7 1-5-101. On the other hand, actions\nagainst nonresidents and foreign corporations \u201cmay be brought\u201d in either of two places\u2013\nwhere the cause of action arose or where the plaintiff resides. \u00a7 1-5-107.\n\n[\u00b619] As we have often stated:\n\n             In interpreting statutes, our primary consideration is to\n             determine the legislature\u2019s intent. All statutes must be\n             construed in pari materia and, in ascertaining the meaning of\n             a given law, all statutes relating to the same subject or having\n             the same general purpose must be considered and construed\n             in harmony. Statutory construction is a question of law, so\n             our standard of review is de novo. We endeavor to interpret\n             statutes in accordance with the legislature\u2019s intent. We begin\n             by making an inquiry respecting the ordinary and obvious\n             meaning of the words employed according to their\n             arrangement and connection. We construe the statute as a\n             whole, giving effect to every word, clause, and sentence, and\n             we construe all parts of the statute in pari materia. When a\n             statute is sufficiently clear and unambiguous, we give effect\n             to the plain and ordinary meaning of the words and do not\n             resort to the rules of statutory construction. Moreover, we\n             must not give a statute a meaning that will nullify its\n             operation if it is susceptible of another interpretation.\n\n                    Moreover, we will not enlarge, stretch, expand, or\n             extend a statute to matters that do not fall within its express\n             provisions.\n\n                    Only if we determine the language of a statute is\n             ambiguous will we proceed to the next step, which involves\n             applying general principles of statutory construction to the\n\n\n                                             5\n\f              language of the statute in order to construe any ambiguous\n              language to accurately reflect the intent of the legislature. If\n              this Court determines that the language of the statute is not\n              ambiguous, there is no room for further construction. We\n              will apply the language of the statute using its ordinary and\n              obvious meaning.\n\n                      Whether a statute is ambiguous is a question of law. A\n              statute is unambiguous if reasonable persons are able to agree\n              as to its meaning with consistency and predictability, while a\n              statute is ambiguous if it is vague or uncertain and subject to\n              varying interpretations.\n\nRock v.

Rock, \u00b6 39, 301 P.3d at 1085 (citing Redco\nConst., \u00b6 37, 271 P.3d at 418). If the legislature had intended that an action could be\nbrought anywhere unless it fell within the scope of a \u201cshall be brought\u201d statute, it would\nnot have passed several statutes specifying where an action may be brought. The\nlegislature would simply have listed the relatively few actions which had to be initiated in\nonly one county and said that \u201call other actions may be brought in any county in the\nstate.\u201d The Court does not perceive the legislature to intend to suggest possible venues,\nbut rather to specify the \u201cgeographical location[s] in which, for the sake of fairness,\nconvenience, or other commanding policy considerations, a cause is to be tried.\u201d Kunz, \u00b6\n14, 186 P.3d at 382 (internal quotation marks omitted)\n\n[\u00b622] In this case, \u00a7 1-5-107 authorized Bourke to file his complaint in one of two\npossible venues: Carbon County, where Bourke resided, or Lincoln County, where the\n\n\n                                              6\n\fcause of action arose. We cannot read \u00a7 1-5-107 so broadly as to authorize the filing of a\ncomplaint in any county in the state. We therefore conclude that the district court\nproperly determined that Natrona County was not a proper venue because the cause of\naction did not arise there, and Bourke resides in Carbon County.\n\n          Propriety of Dismissal\n\n[\u00b623] Bourke also argues that even if venue was not proper in Natrona County, the case\nshould have been transferred rather than dismissed.

It also contends\nthat \u201cPlaintiff was never entitled to a change of venue. If entitlement was the policy, a\nplaintiff could file an action without regard to venue and would then be entitled to move\nit to the proper venue whenever he fancied.\u201d\n\n[\u00b625] We think the issue is somewhat simpler than either party makes it out to be.\nMatter of Larsen was a case with a complicated procedural history which is of little value\nin analyzing the issue presented here. Larsen was injured in a vehicle rollover in\nCampbell County and timely filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits in the\ndistrict court for that county. Larsen, 770 P.2d at 1090. At the time, worker\u2019s\ncompensation claims were required to be filed with the clerk of the district court in the\ncounty where the injury occurred, and so Larsen filed in the right place. Wyo. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7 27-12-601(a) (June 1983), repealed by 1986 Wyo. Sess. Laws Sp. Sess., ch. 3 \u00a7 3. The\napplicable statute also provided that the employer or employee could request a transfer of\nvenue to the county in which the employer was based or the employee lived after it was\nproperly filed in the county in which the injury occurred.4\n\n\n\n4\n    This former provision read as follows:\n\n                  (b) At any time after the employee files his claim, he may request that\n                  the case and entire file be transferred to the district court of the county in\n                  which he resides. At any time after the employer has filed the\n                  employer\u2019s report of injury, he may request that the case and entire file\n                  be transferred to the district court of the county in which his main office\n                  in Wyoming is located. . . . If no objection is filed within ten (10) days\n                  after notice has been mailed, or if both parties request transfer of the case\n                  to the same district court, the clerk shall make proper notation in the\n                  docket and forward the entire file to the district court requested.\n\n\n\n                                                         7\n\f[\u00b626] Larsen moved to transfer the case to the Eighth Judicial District. Hall\nConstruction did not object, and the Sixth Judicial District judge attempted to transfer the\ncase. The Eighth Judicial District judge returned the case to the Sixth Judicial District\nwithout being asked to do so by either party or entering an order formally transferring it\nback. The Sixth Judicial District judge then granted summary judgment to the employer\nand again attempted to return the case to the Eighth Judicial District. Larson, 770 P.2d at\n1090\u201391.\n\n[\u00b627] On appeal, Larsen argued that the Sixth Judicial District lacked subject matter\njurisdiction to hear the case because procedures required to transfer the case back from\nthe Eighth Judicial District were not followed. Larsen, 770 P.2d at 1090\u201391. This Court\ndistinguished the concepts of venue and subject matter jurisdiction:\n\n                       The district courts in this state are courts of general\n               jurisdiction. As such, they have inherent subject matter\n               jurisdiction over any and all cases in which jurisdiction is not\n               specifically vested in some court of limited jurisdiction. This\n               jurisdiction includes jurisdiction over worker\u2019s compensation\n               claims and disputes such as the one in this case. Once\n               jurisdiction is acquired, the district court has the power to\n               hear and determine the matter and to render a binding\n               ju d g m e n t .

Bowen\nin concluding that improper venue does not normally warrant a dismissal, but that the\ncase should instead be transferred. In Sil-Flo, the Arizona Supreme Court applied\nArizona Revised Statute \u00a7 12-404, which specifically provides for transfer of improperly\nvenued cases.5 The Sil-Flo Court held that \u201c[w]here venue of an action has been\nimproperly laid, the remedy of the party complaining of the error in venue is not\ndismissal of the action, but is to seek its removal to the court having the proper venue\nunder the proceduer [sic] set forth in A.R.S. \u00a7 12-404.\u201d Sil-Flo, 402 P.2d at 27.\n\n[\u00b630] Title 28, Section 1406(a) of the United States Code also contains a venue transfer\nprovision. It authorizes federal district courts to dismiss or transfer an improperly venued\ncase \u201cif it be in the interest of justice . . . .\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) (2012).

The transfer statute that played a part in the\nLarsen decision applied only to workers\u2019 compensation claims filed in the proper venue,\nand it has been repealed. Bourke has not directed us to any common law power which\nwould permit or require a district court to transfer such a case either. The district judge\ndid not err in dismissing the case in the absence of any authority to do otherwise.\n\n[\u00b632] In the district court, Bourke relied on W.R.C.P. 40.1(a), which authorizes a\ntransfer of the place of trial under the following circumstances:\n\n                (1) The court upon motion of any party made within 15 days\n                after the last pleading is filed shall transfer the action to\n                another county for trial if the court is satisfied that there exists\n                within the county where the action is pending such prejudice\n                against the party or the party\u2019s cause that the party cannot\n                obtain a fair and impartial trial, or that the convenience of\n                witnesses would be promoted thereby. . . .\n                                             . . .\n                (3) The presiding judge may at any time upon the judge\u2019s\n                own motion order a transfer of trial when it appears that the\n                ends of justice would be promoted thereby.\n\nW.R.C.P. 40.1(a).\n\n[\u00b633] Bourke did not argue in this appeal that Rule 40.1(a)(1) or (3) required a transfer\nrather than a dismissal. That contention has therefore been abandoned, and we do not\naddress it.6 We note in passing that the rule does not by its terms apply to cases in which\nsuit has been filed in the wrong venue, but rather to transfer of trial when fairness\nrequires that the case be tried elsewhere. Nothing in this record suggests that this case\ncould not have been tried fairly in Natrona County, venue issues notwithstanding.\n\n6\n  See, e.g., Bedessem v.

Under\nW.R.C.P. 41(b)(1), a dismissal for failure to state a claim is a dismissal on the merits, and\n\n\n                                               11\n\fit is with prejudice, unless the court otherwise specifies. 7 The district court entered a\njudgment against Bourke, and we believe the court clearly intended to rule on the merits\nand to dismiss with prejudice. Bourke could not therefore simply refile in the correct\nvenue as he could have under the savings statute if the dismissal had been without\nprejudice based only upon improper venue.\n\n[\u00b638] This result requires us to determine whether a district court may reach the merits\nof a controversy after concluding that it must be dismissed because it is improperly\nvenued.

The company filed a consolidated motion to dismiss for improper\nvenue, lack of personal jurisdiction, and failure of the complaint to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. The district court dismissed for failure to state a claim, but\ndid not decide the challenges to venue and jurisdiction. Id. at 220\u201321. Judge Friendly,\nwriting on behalf of the Second Circuit, held as follows:\n\n                     We all agree it was error for the district court to\n                proceed as it did. Not only does logic compel initial\n\n7\n  The language of W.R.C.P. 41(b)(1) is practically identical to that of its federal counterpart, F.R.C.P.\n41(b), and we find federal authority in this area highly persuasive. The Federal Practice & Procedure\ntreatise explains the operative effect of a dismissal for failure to state a claim as follows:\n\n                As is stated clearly in the rule, and the extensive case law under the\n                subdivision, a dismissal under Rule 41(b) or any other dismissal not\n                provided for in Rule 41 will operate as an adjudication on the merits\n                unless the district court otherwise specifies or the dismissal is for lack of\n                personal or subject matter jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join\n                a party under Rule 19.3 Thus, because an involuntary dismissal is an\n                adjudication on the merits, it is, in the phrase commonly used by the\n                federal courts, \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d\n                                                  . . .\n\n                Dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief\n                can be granted ordinarily are deemed to be an adjudication on the merits,\n                . . . a dismissal with prejudice.\n\n9 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2373 (3d ed. 2008)\n(footnotes omitted). See also 2 Moore et al., supra, at \u00a7 12.34[6][a] (\u201cA dismissal for failure to state a\nclaim is a judgment on the merits . . . . This type of dismissal, presumed to be with prejudice unless the\norder explicitly states otherwise, has a claim preclusive effect.\u201d) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n                                                      12\n\f              consideration of the issue of jurisdiction over the defendant\u2014\n              a court without such jurisdiction lacks power to dismiss a\n              complaint for failure to state a claim\u2014but the functional\n              difference that flows from the ground selected for dismissal\n              likewise compels considering jurisdiction and venue\n              questions first. A dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or\n              improper venue does not preclude a subsequent action in an\n              appropriate forum, whereas a dismissal for failure to state a\n              claim upon which relief can be granted is with prejudice. We\n              shall therefore vacate the judgment dismissing the complaint\n              for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and\n              remand the case for consideration of the issue of jurisdiction\n              over the person of the defendant and, in the event that this be\n              found, the issue of venue, prior to consideration of the merits.\n\nId. at 221 (footnote omitted).\n\n[\u00b640] We agree with Arrowsmith and its progeny that courts should decide preliminary\nchallenges to jurisdiction and venue before reaching the merits of a controversy.

App. Aug. 28, 2000)\n(unpublished opinion).\n\n[\u00b641] The cases just cited did not involve situations in which a court dismissed a case\nbased on improper venue and then reached the merits, but we believe the common-sense\nrule in Arrowsmith precludes doing both. If a court concludes that a case must be\ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, it has determined that the\ncase cannot proceed in that jurisdiction or venue, i.e., that it should not be decided there.\nSee Wyrough, 376 F.2d at 547 (\u201c[T]here also exists a strong policy to conserve judicial\ntime and effort; preliminary matters such as defective service, personal jurisdiction and\nvenue should be raised and disposed of before the court considers the merits or quasi-\nmerits of a controversy.\u201d); Basile, 717 F. Supp. 2d at 385 (\u201c[I]t is hornbook law that\nvenue and personal jurisdiction are threshold procedural issues to be decided before the\nsubstantive grounds in a motion to dismiss.\u201d). A rule that would allow a court to decide\nthat it could not resolve a case on the merits and then do exactly that would make little\nsense. See 9 Wright & Miller, supra, at \u00a7 2373 (\u201c[T]he district court cannot make its\norder an adjudication on the merits if it lacks the power to decide the merits.\u201d).\n\n\n                                              13\n\f[\u00b642] For the reasons stated, we will vacate the district court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal,\nand reverse and remand for an order dismissing without prejudice on venue grounds\nalone.8\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n[\u00b643] We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal for improper venue. However, we find its\nRule 12(b)(6) dismissal on the merits to be improper as a matter of law, and we therefore\nvacate that portion of its order and remand for a dismissal without prejudice based upon\nimproper venue.\n\n\n\n\n8\n At oral argument, counsel were asked whether Appellee\u2019s request that the district court reach the merits,\nor its defense of the district court\u2019s ruling on the merits in this appeal, waived Appellee\u2019s objection to\nvenue. W.R.C.P. 12(g) provides that \u201c[a] party who makes a motion under this rule may join with it any\nother motions herein provided for and then available to the party.\u201d It was therefore clearly proper for\nAppellee to include a challenge to venue and a challenge to the adequacy of Bourke\u2019s pleadings in the\nsame motion.\n         However, an argument could be made that once the case was found to be improperly venued,\nseeking a dismissal on the merits was in fact a request that the court exercise authority to decide the case,\neffectively waiving an objection to venue. This issue was not briefed in the appeal, and neither counsel\nconceded or contended that the objection to venue was waived when they were asked about that\npossibility at oral argument. We therefore do not evaluate the possibility that submitting an order\nimplementing or defending a ruling on the merits of a claim might waive a challenge to venue. This\ndecision does, of course, hand Appellee a Pyrrhic victory if Bourke decides to pursue his claims in a\nproper venue, with a redrafted complaint, effectively requiring it to challenge his pleadings all over again\nbefore a different judge.\n\n\n                                                      14\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
