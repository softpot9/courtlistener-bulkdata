(Camelot) and Galesburg Terrace, Inc.\n(Galesburg) (collectively, Companies) petition for review of a\ndecision and order of the National Labor Relations Board\n(Board) determining that the Companies violated the National\nLabor Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151 et seq., by\nengaging in bad-faith bargaining with the Service Employees\nInternational Union (Union). The Companies do not contest\nthe Board\u2019s conclusion that they violated the Act; rather, they\nchallenge two of the remedies the Board imposed: (1)\nreimbursement of litigation costs incurred by both the Board\nand the Union during Board proceedings and (2)\nreimbursement of \u201call\u201d of the negotiation expenses the Union\nincurred during its bargaining sessions with the Companies.\nSee Camelot Terrace, 357 N.L.R.B. No. 161, 2011 WL\n7121892, at *13, *15 (Dec. 30, 2011). The Companies assert\nthat the Board is without authority to impose either remedy.\nAlternatively, they argue that the amount of the\nbargaining-costs remedy\u2014\u201call\u201d of the Union\u2019s bargaining\nexpenses\u2014exceeds the amount necessary to remedy the harm\ncaused by the Companies\u2019 conduct and is improperly punitive.\n\f                                3\n     We agree that the Board lacks authority to require the\nreimbursement of litigation costs incurred during Board\nproceedings, see HTH Corp. v. NLRB, No. 14-1222, 2016 WL\n2941936, at *9\u201311 (D.C. Cir. May 20, 2016), but hold that the\nBoard may require an employer to reimburse a union\u2019s\nbargaining expenses pursuant to its remedial authority under\nsection 10(c) of the Act. We also conclude that we lack\njurisdiction to entertain the Companies\u2019 alternative challenge\nto the amount of the bargaining-costs award because they\nfailed to raise it before the Board. Accordingly, we grant the\nCompanies\u2019 joint petition in part and grant the Board\u2019s\ncross-application for enforcement in part.\n\n                                I.\n\n     Camelot and Galesburg both operate nursing homes in\nIllinois. In 2007, the Union was certified as the exclusive\nrepresentative of employees at both facilities. Over the course\nof 2008 and 2009, the Companies\u2014primarily through the\nconduct of their common owner, Michael Lerner\u2014repeatedly\nbargained with the Union in bad faith. 1 The Board\u2019s Office of\nthe General Counsel (OGC) got involved, leading to a\n    1\n         Because the Companies do not contest their underlying\nviolations of the Act, there is no need to describe their bad-faith\nconduct in great detail. Their conduct included \u201crestricting the\ndates and length of bargaining sessions, repeatedly canceling and\nshortening sessions, reneging on or withdrawing from tentative\nagreements without good cause, refusing to bargain on economic\nsubjects, and refusing to make economic proposals.\u201d Camelot\nTerrace, 357 N.L.R.B. No. 161, 2011 WL 7121892, at *1. The\nCompanies violated the Act in other ways as well, including dealing\ndirectly with Union-represented employees, unilaterally changing\nthe terms and conditions of employment without providing notice or\nbargaining opportunity to the Union and firing an employee under a\nunilaterally-implemented attendance policy.\n\f                               4\nsettlement agreement detailing specific bargaining\nrequirements the Companies were to satisfy. When the\nCompanies failed to abide by the terms of the agreement and\ncontinued to bargain in bad faith, the OGC issued a complaint\ncharging the Companies with numerous violations of the Act.\nAfter holding a hearing and concluding that the Companies had\nindeed violated the Act, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)\nordered, inter alia, that the Companies \u201c[r]eimburse the\n[Board] . . . and the Union for all costs and expenses incurred\nin the investigation, preparation and conduct of [the case]\nbefore the Board and the courts.\u201d Camelot Terrace, 357\nN.L.R.B. No. 161, 2011 WL 7121892, at *125. The ALJ also\nordered the Companies to \u201c[r]eimburse the Union for all costs\nand expenses incurred in collective-bargaining negotiations\nfrom January 2008 to the [parties\u2019] last bargaining session.\u201d\nId.\n\n     The Companies filed exceptions with the Board,\nchallenging the imposition of these two remedies. In a\ntwo-to-one decision, the Board held that it was authorized to\nimpose both remedies and did so with one modification. 2 The\nbargaining-costs remedy, the Board concluded, was a\nnecessary exercise of its general remedial power: \u201c[o]nly by\nordering the reimbursement of the Union\u2019s negotiating\nexpenses [could] the Board reasonably restore the Union\u2019s\nprevious financial strength and consequent ability to carry out\neffectively its responsibilities as the employees\u2019\nrepresentative.\u201d Id. at *6. As for the litigation-costs remedy,\nthe Board concluded that it \u201chas inherent authority to control\n\n    2\n          The Board modified the litigation-costs remedy by\neliminating the award for costs incurred in court proceedings,\n\u201cleav[ing] that determination to the discretion of the court [of\nappeals].\u201d Camelot Terrace, 357 N.L.R.B. No. 161, 2011 WL\n7121892, at *6 n.8.\n\f                                 5\nits own proceedings, including the authority to award litigation\nexpenses through the application of the \u2018bad-faith\u2019 exception to\nthe American Rule.\u201d Id. The Board declared that its\n\u201cinherent authority\u201d was sufficient to support the remedy and\ntherefore found it \u201cunnecessary to pass on the [Companies\u2019]\nargument that the Board\u2019s remedial authority under [section]\n10(c) of the Act does not encompass the award of litigation\nexpenses.\u201d Id. at *6 n.10. Member Hayes dissented from the\nBoard\u2019s decision on the litigation-costs remedy, explaining\nthat the Board is \u201cnot free to invoke principles of \u2018inherent\nauthority\u2019 in order to unilaterally vest the Board with powers\nbeyond those contemplated by the legislature.\u201d Id. at *17\n(Member Hayes, dissenting). The Companies petitioned for\nreview, challenging the Board\u2019s authority to impose the two\nremedies. The Board cross-applied for enforcement.\n\n                                II.\n\n     At the outset, because \u201cthe Board is entitled to\nenforcement of all unchallenged portions of its order,\u201d we\nsummarily enforce all such provisions of the Board\u2019s decision.\nUnited Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 204 v.\nNLRB, 447 F.3d 821, 824 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (per curiam). As\nfor the two reimbursement orders the Companies do challenge,\nalthough we generally afford the Board deference in reviewing\nits chosen remedies, see Great Lakes Chem. Corp. v. NLRB,\n967 F.2d 624, 629 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (\u201cThe Board has broad\nauthority in devising remedies to effectuate the policies of the\nAct, subject only to limited judicial review.\u201d (citation and\ninternal quotation marks omitted)), deference is limited if a\nparty challenges the Board\u2019s authority to order a particular\nremedy under any circumstance. In that case, to the extent the\nBoard claims its remedial authority arises from the Act, we\ndefer to the Board \u201conly so far as \u2018[its] interpretation is rational\nand consistent with the statute.\u2019 \u201d Unbelievable, Inc. v.\n\f                                 6\nNLRB, 118 F.3d 795, 804 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting NLRB v.\nUnited Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U.S. 112, 123\n(1987)). To the extent the Board relies on extra-statutory\nauthority, we afford no deference at all. See HTH Corp., 2016\nWL 2941936, at *9\u201311 (evaluating Board\u2019s \u201cinherent\nauthority\u201d to award litigation costs without deference); see also\nLocal 777, Democratic Union Org. Comm. v. NLRB, 603 F.2d\n862, 869 n.17 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (\u201cOrdinarily, we show\nconsiderable deference to the judgment of the [Board] . . . [but]\nwhere the issues involved are purely legal . . . , the Board\u2019s\ninterpretation is entitled to no particular deference.\u201d).\n\n      Here, the Companies have abandoned (or forfeited, see\ninfra at 10\u201311) any claim that reimbursement of litigation or\nbargaining expenses was inappropriate in their particular case;\nrather, they attack the Board\u2019s authority to award bargaining\nand litigation costs in all cases. Accordingly, we defer to the\nBoard\u2019s view of the matter only insofar as its interpretation of\nits statutory power is \u201crational\u201d and \u201cconsistent\u201d with the Act.\nSee Unbelievable, Inc., 118 F.3d at 804.\n\n                      A. Litigation Costs\n\n     The Companies first claim that \u201cthe Board has neither\nstatutory nor inherent authority to award litigation expenses,\nincluding attorney\u2019s fees, as a remedy for an unfair labor\npractice.\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 12. For the reasons discussed in HTH\nCorp. v. NLRB, we agree. There, as here, the Board \u201cclaimed\nthat, like a federal court, it has inherent authority to control and\nmaintain the integrity of its own proceedings through an\napplication of the bad-faith exception to the American Rule\u201d\nand ordered an employer to pay the litigation expenses of a\nunion and of the OGC. HTH Corp., 2016 WL 2941936, at *9\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We declined to enforce\nthe order. See id. at *11. Recognizing that \u201c[a]s a creature of\n\f                               7\nstatute the Board has only those powers conferred upon it by\nCongress,\u201d we held that \u201cthe Board may apply the bad-faith\nexception to the American rule only if some provision or\nprovisions of the Act explicitly or implicitly grant it power to\ndo so.\u201d Id. at *9. Although the Board \u201crelied solely on its\ninherent authority to control and maintain the integrity of its\nown proceedings,\u201d and the court recognized \u201cthat it is wrong to\nspeak of agencies as having any inherent authority,\u201d the\nmajority\u2014perhaps in an effort to give the Board the benefit of\nthe doubt\u2014went on to consider whether the Act\u2019s general\nendowment of remedial authority under section 10(c)\n\u201cimplicitly authorizes fee shifting based on bad faith.\u201d See id.\nat *9\u201310 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The majority ultimately concluded that section\n10(c) did not do so, primarily because \u201cthe Supreme Court has\nconsistently classified application of the bad-faith exception to\nthe American rule as punitive,\u201d id. at *10 (citing Hall v. Cole,\n412 U.S. 1, 5 (1973)), and a \u201c[section] 10(c) remedy . . . \u2018must\nbe truly remedial and not punitive,\u2019 \u201d id. (quoting Capital\nCleaning Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, 147 F.3d 999, 1009 (D.C.\nCir. 1998)).\n\n     Our decision in HTH controls. As in HTH, the Board in\nthis case claims the power to require the Companies to pay the\nBoard\u2019s litigation costs and those of the Union solely on the\nbasis of its \u201cinherent authority.\u201d Camelot Terrace, 357\nN.L.R.B. No. 161, 2011 WL 7121892, at *6 & n.10. But as\nHTH makes plain, the Board possesses no extra-statutory\n\u201cinherent authority.\u201d HTH Corp., 2016 WL 2941936, at *9.\nMoreover, to the extent the Board meant \u201cimplicit in section\n10(c)\u201d when it said \u201cinherent,\u201d see id. at *10, it loses on that\nscore as well\u2014section 10(c) neither explicitly nor by\nimplication authorizes the Board to award litigation costs, see\nid. at *10\u201311. Accordingly, we deny enforcement of the\nlitigation-costs order. See id. at *11.\n\f                                8\n                    B. Bargaining Costs\n\n     The Companies also challenge the Board\u2019s general\nauthority to require one party to reimburse another\u2019s\nbargaining costs; in the alternative, the Companies claim that\nthe Board may not award the Union \u201call\u201d of its bargaining costs\nbecause the Union would have incurred at least some of those\ncosts had the Companies bargained in good faith.\n\n                               1.\n\n     As a threshold matter, the Board contends that we lack\njurisdiction to entertain these two claims because the\nCompanies failed to raise them with the Board. It is well\nsettled that, absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d if a party\nfails to \u201curge[]\u201d an objection before the Board, we lack\njurisdiction to consider it for the first time on appeal. 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 160(e); see also Woelke & Romero Framing, Inc. v.\nNLRB, 456 U.S. 645, 665\u201366 (1982); HTH Corp., 2016 WL\n2941936, at *3. In assessing forfeiture under section 10(e) of\nthe Act, \u201cthe critical question\u201d is \u201cwhether the Board received\nadequate notice of the basis for the objection.\u201d Alwin Mfg.\nCo. v. NLRB, 192 F.3d 133, 143 (D.C. Cir. 1999); see also\nDHL Express, Inc. v. NLRB, 813 F.3d 365, 372 (D.C. Cir.\n2016) (considering whether \u201cpetitioner\u2019s brief in support of its\nexceptions adequately put the Board on notice of the grounds\non which the petitioner is objecting\u201d (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). \u201cWhile we have not required that the ground for\nthe exception be stated explicitly in the written exceptions filed\nwith the Board, we have required, at a minimum, that the\nground for the exception be \u2018evident by the context in which\n[the exception] is raised.\u2019 \u201d Parsippany Hotel Mgmt. Co. v.\nNLRB, 99 F.3d 413, 417 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Consol. Freightways v. NLRB, 669 F.2d 790,\n794 (D.C. Cir. 1981)).\n\f                               9\n     Here, the Companies\u2019 written exceptions and supporting\nbriefs together preserved their argument that the Board\ngenerally lacks authority to require reimbursement of\nbargaining costs\u2014but just barely. The Companies\u2019 exception\nto the bargaining-costs remedy was indeed \u201cvague,\u201d see DHL\nExpress, 813 F.3d at 372, but nonetheless charged that the\nbargaining-costs remedy violated \u201cestablished Board law and\npolicy,\u201d Resp\u2019ts\u2019 Exceptions to the A.L.J.\u2019s Decision 2 (Mar.\n10, 2010). Similarly, although their supporting brief was \u201cno\nparagon of precision or detail,\u201d it included several statements\n\u201cadequate to apprise the Board that the Compan[ies] intended\nto press the question now presented\u201d\u2014that the Board lacked\nthe power to require reimbursement of bargaining costs. See\nNLRB v. Blake Constr. Co., 663 F.2d 272, 284 (D.C. Cir.\n1981).\n\n      The best example is an express statement to that effect in\none of the brief\u2019s headings, which read, \u201cThe Board Lacks\nAuthority to Award Litigation Expenses and Bargaining\nCosts.\u201d Resp\u2019ts\u2019 Br. in Supp. of Exceptions to the A.L.J.\u2019s\nDecision 4 (emphasis added). Other parts of the brief also\napprised the Board that its authority was being questioned.\nThe Companies averred that the ALJ \u201cmade erroneous legal\nconclusions with regard to the [bargaining-costs] remedy,\u201d id.\nat 2, and in a different subheading stated, \u201cThe Board Lacks the\nInherent Authority to Award Costs,\u201d id. at 6 (emphasis added).\nAnd notwithstanding these sections of the brief primarily\naddressed litigation costs, the brief transitioned into a new\nsection with the statement, \u201c[e]ven if the Board has the\nauthority to order a respondent to pay litigation and bargaining\ncosts,\u201d id. at 6 (emphasis added), indicating to the Board that\nthe brief\u2019s discussion of the generic \u201ccosts,\u201d see id., was meant\nto cover bargaining costs as well as litigation costs. We\ntherefore conclude that \u201cthe Board received adequate notice of\n\f                              10\nthe basis for the [Companies\u2019] objection,\u201d see Alwin, 192 F.3d\nat 143, and we may consider the merits of the challenge.\n\n     The same is not true of the Companies\u2019 alternative\nargument that even if the Board has the authority to award\nbargaining costs generally, it may not award \u201call\u201d of the\nUnion\u2019s costs. The thrust of the claim is that the Board may\naward bargaining costs only to the extent the Companies\u2019\nbad-faith conduct caused the Union to incur such costs\nunnecessarily. Because \u201cthe Union undoubtedly would have\nincurred some bargaining costs\u201d even if the Companies had\nproperly discharged their duty to negotiate in good faith, the\nCompanies argue that, in awarding the Union \u201call\u201d of its\nbargaining costs, the Board \u201ccrossed the line separating\npermissible remedial action from impermissible punitive\naction.\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 28\u201329. The Companies never presented\nthis argument to the Board but they argue that we should\nnonetheless consider it because the award is \u201cpatently in excess\nof [the Board\u2019s] authority,\u201d see Alwin, 192 F.3d at 143 n.13\n(alteration in original) (quoting Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB,\n440 U.S. 301, 311 n.10 (1979)), and therefore their failure to\nraise the issue should be \u201cexcused because of extraordinary\ncircumstances,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e).\n\n     Although \u201ca remedy that is patently ultra vires\u201d generally\nwarrants review even if not challenged at the Board level, see\nHTH Corp., 2016 WL 2941936, at *3 (citing Alwin, 192 F.3d\nat 143 n.13), the bargaining-costs remedy at issue does not\npatently run afoul of the limits on the Board\u2019s power. If the\nBoard has the authority to award bargaining costs generally, it\nis not inconceivable that requiring the reimbursement of all of\na party\u2019s bargaining expenses might be necessary; for instance,\nif an employer repeatedly schedules bargaining sessions with a\nunion but is a perpetual no-show, reimbursing all of the\nexpenses the union incurred in connection with those planned\n\f                                11\nsessions when no bargaining in fact took place would be\nrequired to return the union to its financial position ex ante,\nwhich is the Board\u2019s justification for awarding bargaining\ncosts in the first place. See Fallbrook Hosp. Corp. v. NLRB,\n785 F.3d 729, 732 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (bargaining-costs remedy\n\u201cwarranted . . . to restore the economic strength that is\nnecessary to ensure a return to the status quo ante at the\nbargaining table\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Thus,\nsuch an award is not \u201cobviously ultra vires\u201d in all\ncircumstances. See Alwin, 192 F.3d at 143 n.13.\n\n     Nor is it obvious that an award of all of the Union\u2019s\nexpenses was not necessary to remedy the wrong here; indeed,\nthe Board may well have concluded as much. This fact\nunderscores why we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim on\nthe merits\u2014the Board has the first crack at answering whether\nand why awarding \u201call\u201d of a union\u2019s bargaining expenses is\nnecessary in the particular circumstances of the case before it.\nSee Local 900, Int\u2019l Union of Elec., Radio & Mach. Workers v.\nNLRB, 727 F.2d 1184, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\u201cSimple fairness\nto those who are engaged in the tasks of administration, and to\nlitigants, requires as a general rule that courts should not topple\nover administrative decisions unless the administrative body\nnot only has erred but has erred against objection made at the\ntime appropriate under its practice.\u201d (quoting United States v.\nL.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952))). The\nBoard had no reason to do so when the Companies never raised\nthis question in an exception or in a motion for reconsideration;\nwe lack jurisdiction, then, to address the claim for the first time\non appeal. 3\n\n\n    3\n        This does not mean, however, that the Companies are\nprohibited from raising this argument before the Board at the\ncompliance stage. At oral argument, in comparing the Board order\nin HTH that noted the union bore the burden of establishing a causal\n\f                                 12\n                                 2.\n\n     Because the Companies forfeited their extent-of-the-\nbargaining-costs claim, only one question remains for\nconsideration on the merits\u2014whether the Board ever has the\nauthority to require a party to reimburse another\u2019s bargaining\ncosts. The Companies contend that the Board has no such\npower. On their theory, the Board\u2019s job is to enforce\nsubstantive legal rights; it may not, however, require one party\nto reimburse another for the costs incurred in vindicating those\nrights. They view bargaining costs as \u201cindistinguishable from\nlitigation costs\u201d in that both \u201crepresent the price of attempting\nto vindicate substantive legal rights.\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 24.\nTherefore, just as awarding litigation costs is aliunde the\nBoard\u2019s remedial authority, so is requiring one party to\nreimburse another\u2019s bargaining costs. The Board, in contrast,\ncontends that requiring a party that has engaged in particularly\negregious bad-faith bargaining to reimburse another party\u2019s\nbargaining costs is well within its remedial power under\nsection 10(c) of the Act.\n\n     We agree with the Board. When the Board determines\nthat a party has committed an unfair labor practice, section\n10(c) of the Act gives it \u201cdiscretion to fashion appropriate\nremedies.\u201d Fallbrook, 785 F.3d at 734. Specifically, the\nBoard \u201cshall issue . . . an order requiring [a violator] to cease\n\n\nrelationship between the costs awarded and the unfair labor practice,\nsee HTH Corp., 361 N.L.R.B. No. 65, at 5 (Oct. 24, 2014), to the\nBoard award of \u201call\u201d bargaining costs here, the Board counsel\nexplained, \u201c[I]t was a different sort of remedy [in HTH] than you\u2019ve\nseen, so [the Board] w[as] reminding the Union we\u2019ve not imposed\nsomething like this before, so FYI, here\u2019s what you need to do in\ncompliance, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different than in other typical\ncompliance proceeding[s].\u201d Oral Arg. Tr. 50:1\u20135.\n\f                               13\nand desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such\naffirmative action . . . as will effectuate the policies of [the\nAct].\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c). \u201c[T]he thrust of affirmative\naction redressing the wrong incurred by an unfair labor\npractice,\u201d according to the United States Supreme Court, \u201cis to\n. . . restor[e] the economic status quo that would have obtained\nbut for the company\u2019s wrongful [act]. The task of the [Board]\nin applying \u00a7 10(c) is to take measures designed to recreate the\nconditions and relationships that would have been had there\nbeen no unfair labor practice.\u201d Franks v. Bowman Transp.\nCo., 424 U.S. 747, 769 (1976) (some alterations in original)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Although we have never directly held that reimbursement\nof bargaining expenses is the type of \u201caffirmative action\u201d that\n\u201ceffectuate[s] the policies\u201d of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(c), the\nBoard has repeatedly asserted as much, see, e.g., Unbelievable,\nInc., 318 N.L.R.B. 857, 859 (1995), enf\u2019d in relevant part, 118\nF.3d 795; Fallbrook Hosp. Corp., 360 N.L.R.B. No. 73, 2014\nWL 1458265, at *2 (Apr. 14, 2014), enf\u2019d, 785 F.3d 729, and\nwe have discussed the Board\u2019s reasoning favorably. As we\nexplained in Fallbrook Hospital Corporation, \u201ca\nreimbursement remedy is appropriate \u2018where it may fairly be\nsaid that [an employer\u2019s] substantial unfair labor practices have\ninfected the core of a bargaining process to such an extent that\ntheir effects cannot be eliminated by the application of\ntraditional remedies.\u2019 \u201d 785 F.3d at 732 (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Fallbrook Hosp. Corp., 360 N.L.R.B. No.\n73, 2014 WL 1458265, at *2). \u201cSuch a remedy is warranted\nboth to make the charging party whole for the resources that\nwere wasted because of the unlawful conduct, and to restore\nthe economic strength that is necessary to ensure a return to the\nstatus quo ante at the bargaining table.\u201d Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Accordingly, we noted that \u201c \u2018[i]n cases of\nunusually aggravated misconduct,\u2019 the Board may order an\n\f                                14\noffending party \u2018to reimburse the charging party for\nnegotiation expenses.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 734 (quoting Unbelievable,\nInc., 318 N.L.R.B. at 859). 4\n\n     Confronted directly with the question for the first time, we\ntoo find the Board\u2019s reasoning persuasive. An award of\nbargaining expenses remedies an unfair labor practice by\nensuring that, upon resolution of the unfair labor practice\ncharge, the injured party can return to negotiations on the same\nfooting it occupied before the violation of the Act occurred.\nSee Fallbrook, 785 F.3d at 732. A more traditional remedy,\nsuch as a bargaining order, is of little value if one party can\ndrain another of its resources by bargaining in bad faith and\nthen extracting concessions as the money wanes. See\nUnbelievable, Inc., 318 N.L.R.B. at 858 (\u201c[A] bargaining order\nalone will not ensure meaningful bargaining, because it cannot\nrestore the Union[] to [its] position[] prior to the futile\nnegotiations. In fact, limiting the remedy to the conventional\nbargaining order would effectively permit the [employer] to\nbenefit from its violations of the Act by ensuring bargaining\n\n    4\n         In Fallbrook and Unbelievable, we were not confronted with\nthe question of the Board\u2019s general authority to order reimbursement\nof bargaining costs; rather, we considered only whether the Board\nhad misapplied its own precedent in deciding that the\nbargaining-costs remedy was warranted on the factual records those\ncases presented. See Fallbrook, 785 F.3d at 736\u201337 (employer\nargued Board improperly determined it had engaged in \u201cunusually\naggravated conduct\u201d); Unbelievable, Inc., 118 F.3d at 799 (\u201cThe\n[employer] does not question the Board\u2019s authority to order a\nrespondent to reimburse the charging party for negotiation expenses\nif the respondent\u2019s misconduct has been unusually aggravated . . . .\nThe Company does argue, however, that there is not substantial\nevidence in the record considered as a whole to support the Board\u2019s\nfindings of fact.\u201d). Here, in contrast, the Companies challenge the\nBoard\u2019s authority to award bargaining costs generally.\n\f                                15\nwith [a] Union[] that [has] been economically weakened by the\n[employer\u2019s] misconduct.\u201d). By instead allowing the harmed\nparty to be returned to its financial position ex ante, the Board\n\u201ceffectuate[s] the policies of the Act.\u201d See id.; see also\nBowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. at 769.\n\n     The Companies do not dispute this rationale per se; in fact,\nthey acknowledge that \u201c[a]n award of bargaining costs . . . can\nbe deemed \u2018remedial\u2019 in a broad sense.\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 27.\nRather, they hold fast to their contention that bargaining costs\nand litigation costs are the same, and, if litigation costs cannot\nbe shifted under the American Rule, neither can bargaining\ncosts. The \u201charm\u201d a bargaining-costs reimbursement order\n\u201cremedies,\u201d they claim, is \u201cnot the sort of harm that is\ngenerally cognizable in our legal system\u2014the time and\nexpense necessary for a party to vindicate its substantive legal\nrights.\u201d Id.\n\n     We reject this approach for several reasons. First,\nalthough the Companies make broad appeals to \u201ctradition,\u201d\n\u201cour legal culture\u201d and \u201cour legal system,\u201d see id. at 24, 27,\nnoticeably absent from their brief is any case suggesting the\nAmerican Rule extends beyond the context of litigation or\nother quasi-judicial adversarial proceedings. That is to say,\nalthough it is well-established that litigation costs are subject to\nthe longstanding, pay-your-own-way tradition the Companies\ndescribe, see, e.g., Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness\nSoc\u2019y, 421 U.S. 240, 247\u201363 (1975), the Companies have\noffered no authority for the proposition that the same tradition\napplies to costs incurred during private contractual\nnegotiations outside the litigation context. See Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 24\u2013\n27.\n\n    Second, even granting the Companies their premise, their\nview of bargaining as a means of \u201cvindicat[ing] substantive\n\f                              16\nlegal rights,\u201d id. at 24, misses the mark. The Act grants the\nemployer and the union alike the right to good-faith\nbargaining, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and a violation of the\nright\u2014like any unfair labor practice\u2014supports a remedy\nmaking the wronged party whole, cf. Bill Johnson\u2019s Rests., Inc.\nv. NLRB, 461 U.S. 731, 747 (1983) (\u201c[T]he Board may order\nthe employer to reimburse the employees whom he had\nwrongfully sued for their attorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses.\u201d).\nThus, even assuming arguendo that \u201cour legal culture\u201d\nprohibits a party from recovering the costs of \u201cvindicat[ing]\u201d\nsubstantive rights as a general matter, see Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. at 24,\nsuch a rule would not prohibit the Board from awarding\nbargaining costs for bad-faith conduct during collective\nbargaining.\n\n     Third, and finally, the justifications for awarding\nbargaining costs and for awarding litigation costs pursuant to\nthe bad-faith exception to the American Rule are not, contrary\nto the Companies\u2019 claim, \u201cessentially the same,\u201d see id. at 26;\nindeed, there are critical differences. The U.S. Supreme Court\nhas explained that a litigation-cost award is, in the context of\nthe bad-faith exception, a punitive measure\u2014it \u201cvindicate[s] [a\ncourt\u2019s] authority over a recalcitrant litigant.\u201d Chambers v.\nNASCO, 501 U.S. 32, 53 (1991) (some alterations in original)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \u201c[t]hat the\naward ha[s] a compensatory effect does not\u201d deprive it of its\npunitive purpose. See id. (some alterations in original)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, the Board\u2019s\nrationale for awarding bargaining costs is consistent with the\n\u201cthrust of affirmative action\u201d effectuating the Act\u2019s\npurposes\u2014\u201crestor[ing] the economic status quo that would\nhave obtained but for the [Companies\u2019] wrongful [acts].\u201d\nBowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. at 769 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). And just as the incidental \u201ccompensatory\neffect\u201d of a litigation-costs award does not render that award\n\f                               17\n\u201cremedial,\u201d see Chambers, 501 U.S. at 53 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), neither does the incidental deterrent effect of a\nbargaining-costs award render it \u201cpunitive.\u201d Indeed, awards\nthat our \u201clegal culture,\u201d see Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 24, plainly treats as\nremedial\u2014such as compensatory damages in a tort suit\u2014often\nhave (and are intended to have) a deterrent effect. See, e.g., 1\nDan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden & Ellen M. Bublick, The Law\nof Torts \u00a7 14 (2d ed. updated 2015) (West) (\u201cCourts and\nwriters almost always recognize that another aim of tort law is\nto deter certain kinds of conduct by imposing liability when\nthat conduct causes harm.\u201d). The same is true of bargaining\nexpenses in the labor law context. Although an award of such\ncosts might make the Companies think twice before again\nwasting the Union\u2019s time, the primary justification for the\naward is to make the Union whole and \u201cto recreate the\nconditions . . . that would have been had there been no unfair\nlabor practice.\u201d Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. at 769\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    Accordingly, we have little trouble concluding that\nawarding bargaining costs in the appropriate case is within the\nBoard\u2019s statutory remedial authority under section 10(c) of the\nAct. Because the Companies do not challenge the Board\u2019s\nconclusion that they engaged in \u201cunusually aggravated\nmisconduct\u201d that \u201cinfected the core of a bargaining process,\u201d\nsee Fallbrook, 785 F.3d at 732, 734 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), we enforce the Board\u2019s order requiring the\nCompanies to reimburse the Union for its bargaining costs.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we grant the Companies\u2019\npetition for review with respect to the litigation-costs remedy\nand enforce the remainder of the Board\u2019s order.\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued February 9, 2016              Decided June 10, 2016\n\n                       No. 12-1071\n\n CAMELOT TERRACE, INC.

The Companies do not contest\nthe Board\u2019s conclusion that they violated the Act; rather, they\nchallenge two of the remedies the Board imposed: (1)\nreimbursement of litigation costs incurred by both the Board\nand the Union during Board proceedings and (2)\nreimbursement of \u201call\u201d of the negotiation expenses the Union\nincurred during its bargaining sessions with the Companies.\nSee Camelot Terrace, 357 N.L.R.B.

The\nBoard had no reason to do so when the Companies never raised\nthis question in an exception or in a motion for reconsideration;\nwe lack jurisdiction, then, to address the claim for the first time\non appeal. 3\n\n\n    3\n        This does not mean, however, that the Companies are\nprohibited from raising this argument before the Board at the\ncompliance stage. At oral argument, in comparing the Board order\nin HTH that noted the union bore the burden of establishing a causal\n\f                                 12\n                                 2.\n\n     Because the Companies forfeited their extent-of-the-\nbargaining-costs claim, only one question remains for\nconsideration on the merits\u2014whether the Board ever has the\nauthority to require a party to reimburse another\u2019s bargaining\ncosts. The Companies contend that the Board has no such\npower. On their theory, the Board\u2019s job is to enforce\nsubstantive legal rights; it may not, however, require one party\nto reimburse another for the costs incurred in vindicating those\nrights. They view bargaining costs as \u201cindistinguishable from\nlitigation costs\u201d in that both \u201crepresent the price of attempting\nto vindicate substantive legal rights.\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 24.\nTherefore, just as awarding litigation costs is aliunde the\nBoard\u2019s remedial authority, so is requiring one party to\nreimburse another\u2019s bargaining costs. The Board, in contrast,\ncontends that requiring a party that has engaged in particularly\negregious bad-faith bargaining to reimburse another party\u2019s\nbargaining costs is well within its remedial power under\nsection 10(c) of the Act.\n\n     We agree with the Board. When the Board determines\nthat a party has committed an unfair labor practice, section\n10(c) of the Act gives it \u201cdiscretion to fashion appropriate\nremedies.\u201d Fallbrook, 785 F.3d at 734.

Accordingly, we noted that \u201c \u2018[i]n cases of\nunusually aggravated misconduct,\u2019 the Board may order an\n\f                                14\noffending party \u2018to reimburse the charging party for\nnegotiation expenses.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 734 (quoting Unbelievable,\nInc., 318 N.L.R.B. at 859). 4\n\n     Confronted directly with the question for the first time, we\ntoo find the Board\u2019s reasoning persuasive. An award of\nbargaining expenses remedies an unfair labor practice by\nensuring that, upon resolution of the unfair labor practice\ncharge, the injured party can return to negotiations on the same\nfooting it occupied before the violation of the Act occurred.\nSee Fallbrook, 785 F.3d at 732. A more traditional remedy,\nsuch as a bargaining order, is of little value if one party can\ndrain another of its resources by bargaining in bad faith and\nthen extracting concessions as the money wanes. See\nUnbelievable, Inc., 318 N.L.R.B. at 858 (\u201c[A] bargaining order\nalone will not ensure meaningful bargaining, because it cannot\nrestore the Union[] to [its] position[] prior to the futile\nnegotiations. In fact, limiting the remedy to the conventional\nbargaining order would effectively permit the [employer] to\nbenefit from its violations of the Act by ensuring bargaining\n\n    4\n         In Fallbrook and Unbelievable, we were not confronted with\nthe question of the Board\u2019s general authority to order reimbursement\nof bargaining costs; rather, we considered only whether the Board\nhad misapplied its own precedent in deciding that the\nbargaining-costs remedy was warranted on the factual records those\ncases presented. See Fallbrook, 785 F.3d at 736\u201337 (employer\nargued Board improperly determined it had engaged in \u201cunusually\naggravated conduct\u201d); Unbelievable, Inc., 118 F.3d at 799 (\u201cThe\n[employer] does not question the Board\u2019s authority to order a\nrespondent to reimburse the charging party for negotiation expenses\nif the respondent\u2019s misconduct has been unusually aggravated . . . .\nThe Company does argue, however, that there is not substantial\nevidence in the record considered as a whole to support the Board\u2019s\nfindings of fact.\u201d). Here, in contrast, the Companies challenge the\nBoard\u2019s authority to award bargaining costs generally.\n\f                                15\nwith [a] Union[] that [has] been economically weakened by the\n[employer\u2019s] misconduct.\u201d). By instead allowing the harmed\nparty to be returned to its financial position ex ante, the Board\n\u201ceffectuate[s] the policies of the Act.\u201d See id.; see also\nBowman Transp. Co., 424 U.S. at 769.\n\n     The Companies do not dispute this rationale per se; in fact,\nthey acknowledge that \u201c[a]n award of bargaining costs . . . can\nbe deemed \u2018remedial\u2019 in a broad sense.\u201d Pet\u2019rs\u2019 Br. 27.\nRather, they hold fast to their contention that bargaining costs\nand litigation costs are the same, and, if litigation costs cannot\nbe shifted under the American Rule, neither can bargaining\ncosts. The \u201charm\u201d a bargaining-costs reimbursement order\n\u201cremedies,\u201d they claim, is \u201cnot the sort of harm that is\ngenerally cognizable in our legal system\u2014the time and\nexpense necessary for a party to vindicate its substantive legal\nrights.\u201d Id.\n\n     We reject this approach for several reasons. First,\nalthough the Companies make broad appeals to \u201ctradition,\u201d\n\u201cour legal culture\u201d and \u201cour legal system,\u201d see id. at 24, 27,\nnoticeably absent from their brief is any case suggesting the\nAmerican Rule extends beyond the context of litigation or\nother quasi-judicial adversarial proceedings. That is to say,\nalthough it is well-established that litigation costs are subject to\nthe longstanding, pay-your-own-way tradition the Companies\ndescribe, see, e.g., Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness\nSoc\u2019y, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109246\"><a href=\"/opinion/109246/alyeska-pipeline-service-co-v-wilderness-society/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247\u201363 (1975), the Companies have\noffered no authority for the proposition that the same tradition\napplies to costs incurred during private contractual\nnegotiations outside the litigation context.
