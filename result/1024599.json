This court may\n\nexercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n\n(2000); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan\n\nCorp., 337 U.S. 541, 545-46 (1949).        Because the deficiencies\n\nidentified by the district court may be remedied by the filing of\n\na complaint that names individual defendants, we conclude that this\n\nportion of the order Rutherford seeks to appeal is neither a final\n\norder nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.
