Henry M. Herlong, Jr., District\nJudge. (6:07-cv-01871-HMH)\n\n\nSubmitted:   December 13, 2007         Decided:     December 17, 2007\n\n\nBefore NIEMEYER, MOTZ, and SHEDD, Circuit Judges.\n\n\nDismissed in part; affirmed in part by unpublished per curiam\nopinion.\n\n\nElbert John Benjamin Rutherford, Appellant Pro Se.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n          Elbert Rutherford seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s\n\norder accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and\n\ndismissing his civil action without prejudice.       This court may\n\nexercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n\n(2000); Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b); Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan\n\nCorp., 337 U.S. 541, 545-46 (1949).        Because the deficiencies\n\nidentified by the district court may be remedied by the filing of\n\na complaint that names individual defendants, we conclude that this\n\nportion of the order Rutherford seeks to appeal is neither a final\n\norder nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral order.       See\n\nDomino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Worker\u2019s Local Union 392, 10 F.3d 1064,\n\n1066-67 (4th Cir. 1993) (a dismissal without prejudice is generally\n\nnot appealable).    A dismissal without prejudice, however, could be\n\nfinal if no amendment to the complaint would cure the defect in the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s case.    Id. at 1066-67.    Therefore the portion of the\n\norder appealed stating defects in this case that could not be cured\n\nby amendment to the complaint is appealable and this court has\n\njurisdiction. Those claims are affirmed on the reasoning stated by\n\nthe district court.     Rutherford v. Drug Enforcement Admin, No.\n\n6:07-cv-01871-MHM (D.S.C.
