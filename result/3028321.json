L. No. 104-404, 110 Stat. 56 (1996)\n(\u201cTelecommunications Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d). The United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held that\nthe Act prevents parties from taking such claims to federal court\nuntil they have been litigated before a state commission. Core\nCommunications, Inc. (\u201cCore\u201d), argues that the District Court\nerred by misapplying Chevron deference to graft onto the Act an\nexhaustion requirement for enforcement actions when Congress\ndid not provide for one. For the reasons that follow, we will\n\n                                3\n\faffirm the judgment of the District Court dismissing Count III\nof Core\u2019s complaint without prejudice, vacate the dismissal of\nthe remaining counts, and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                               I.\n\n        The dispute in this case centers on the duties an\nincumbent provider of telecommunications services owes with\nrespect to new entrants who wish to compete with the incumbent\nin a particular local market, and how those duties are enforced.\nSuch questions are governed by the Telecommunications Act of\n1996, which was enacted \u201cto promote competition and reduce\nregulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality\nservice for American telecommunications consumers and\nencourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications\ntechnologies.\u201d Preamble, Telecommunications Act of 1996,\nPub. L. No. 104-404, 110 Stat. 56 (1996). \u201cAs the legislative\nhistory explains, the Act creates \u2018a pro-competitive,\nde-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate\nrapidly private sector deployment of advanced\ntelecommunications and information technologies and services\nto all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to\ncompetition.\u2019\u201d Puerto Rico Tel.

Huber et al., Federal\nTelecommunications Law \u00a7 3.3.4 (2d ed. 1999)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The \u201cintended effect\u201d of such a\nregime was to \u201cleav[e] state commissions free, where warranted,\nto reflect the policy choices made by their states.\u201d Id.\n\n        There are two sections of the Act that are at issue in this\ncase: \u00a7\u00a7 251 and 252. Section 251 requires companies that\ntraditionally provide local phone service \u2013 known as incumbent\nlocal exchange carriers (\u201cILECs\u201d) \u2013 to interconnect their\nnetworks with the networks of competitors \u2013 known as\ncompeting local exchange carriers (\u201cCLECs\u201d). 47 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 251(c)(2). Specifically, the Act charges ILECs with:\n\n       The duty to provide, for the facilities and\n       equipment of any requesting telecommunications\n       carrier, interconnection with the local exchange\n       carrier\u2019s network--\n\n       (A) for the transmission and routing of telephone\n       exchange service and exchange access;\n\n       (B) at any technically feasible point within the\n       carrier\u2019s network;\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f       (C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided\n       by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any\n       subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party to which\n       the carrier provides interconnection; and\n\n       (D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just,\n       reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance\n       with the terms and conditions of the agreement\n       and the requirements of this section and section\n       252 of this title.\n\nId. \u00a7 251(c)(2). It also requires ILECs to lease portions of their\nexisting networks to their competitors and to permit the\n\u201cphysical collocation of [CLEC] equipment necessary for\ninterconnection or access to unbundled network elements\u201d at the\nILEC\u2019s premises. Id. \u00a7 251(c)(3), (6). Without these\nrequirements, new entrants could not afford to build the large\nand expensive communications grids that incumbents have\ndeveloped through years in the market.\n\n        To implement these new duties, the Act relies on a\nsystem of private negotiations, followed by arbitration, if\nnecessary, both under the supervision of state commissions. All\nof these steps to attain an interconnection agreement may be\nfollowed by federal court review, if it is sought by the parties.\nThe process commences when an ILEC receives a \u201crequest for\ninterconnection\u201d from another telecommunications company.\nId. \u00a7 252(a)(1). The Act then requires the ILEC to \u201cnegotiate in\ngood faith in accordance with section 252 . . . the particular\nterms and conditions of agreements to fulfill\u201d its substantive\nduties under the Act. Id. \u00a7 252(c)(1). A requesting carrier may\n\n                                 6\n\falso choose to adopt all of the terms and conditions of an\nexisting state commission-approved agreement that the\nincumbent has with another carrier. Id. \u00a7 252(i).\n\n        To deal with problems that may arise during the\nnegotiation period, the Act provides that, if the parties are\nunable to agree, either party may petition the state commission\nto arbitrate \u201copen issues.\u201d Id. \u00a7 252(b)(1). As a final procedural\nsafeguard, all interconnection agreements must be submitted to\nthe state commission for approval. Id. \u00a7 252(e)(1). The\ncommission\u2019s \u201cdeterminations\u201d with respect to the agreements\nare subject to review in federal court. Id. \u00a7 252(e)(6).\n\n       Pursuant to the Act, Core entered into an interconnection\nagreement with Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cVerizon\u201d)\npredecessor in interest on March 31, 2000. Rather than\nnegotiating from scratch, Core opted into the existing agreement\nbetween Verizon\u2019s predecessor (Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania,\nInc.) and MCImetro Access Transmission Services, Inc.\n\n       Between the fall of 2000 and October 2002, Core\nrequested interconnection to various markets in Pennsylvania.\nCore alleges that Verizon deliberately and unjustifiably refused\nto interconnect with Core at technically feasible points in a\ntimely manner. Rather than using existing facilities with spare\ncapacity to interconnect, Verizon cited its internal policy of\nrequiring the construction of new, dedicated facilities to\ninterconnect with Core. No technical or business justification\nwas given explaining the need for this requirement. Core claims\nthat Verizon intentionally took these steps in order to maintain\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fits competitive advantage in Pennsylvania markets and to\nintimidate and financially harm Core.\n\n       On September 24, 2004, Core filed the complaint\nunderlying this action in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania. It alleged that Verizon\u2019s\nconduct violated the Telecommunications Act, as amended,\nincluding \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 202 (Count I), and \u00a7 251 (Count II),\nconstituted a material breach of the interconnection agreement\n(Count III), and was tortious under Pennsylvania\u2019s common law\nfor intentional non-disclosure and fraudulent concealment\n(Count IV).\n\n       On November 4, 2004, Verizon filed a motion to dismiss,\nseeking the dismissal of Counts I, II, and IV for failure to state\na claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6), and Count III for lack of jurisdiction\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). On March 21,\n2006, the District Court dismissed Core\u2019s complaint in its\nentirety without prejudice. It reasoned that, although it had\nfederal question and diversity jurisdiction over the action under\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332, Chevron deference required that\nit adhere to the FCC\u2019s ruling in In re Starpower\nCommunications, LLC, 15 F.C.C.R. 11277 (2000). Under that\ndecision, the District Court concluded that \u00a7 252 of the Act\nimposed \u201can intermediate step before getting to federal court,\nnot unlike an exhaustion of remedies requirement,\u201d with respect\nto interconnection agreement-related claims.           See Core\nCommc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Verizon Pa., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2415298\"><a href=\"/opinion/2415298/core-communications-v-verizon-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 500\n(E.D. Pa. 2006). That is, it concluded that Core must seek\nreview by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (\u201cPA\n\n                                8\n\fPUC\u201d) of its claim that the approved interconnection agreement\nhad been breached before resorting to the federal courts.\n\n        On April 5, 2006, Core filed a motion for reconsideration\nor amended judgment. Following this motion, Core and Verizon\nentered into a tolling agreement that tolled the statute of\nlimitations on Core\u2019s claims until forty-five days after the entry\nof an order resolving or otherwise disposing of an appeal to this\nCourt from the District Court\u2019s decision. In accordance with\nthat agreement, Core filed a praecipe to withdraw its motion for\nreconsideration or amended judgment on April 19, 2006. In the\nwake of this agreement, Core filed a notice of appeal on\nApril 20, 2006. On April 26, 2006, this Court issued a stay\npending the District Court\u2019s disposition of Core\u2019s motion for\nreconsideration, which was dismissed as moot on May 3, 2006.\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n        Before moving to any of the claims raised by Core, we\nmust first determine whether or not we have jurisdiction to hear\nthis case. Verizon argues that there is no appellate jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because a district court\u2019s dismissal\nwithout prejudice is not ordinarily a final order unless the\napplicable statute of limitations would not permit the re-filing of\nthe claims. Core, on the other hand, contends that we do have\nappellate jurisdiction because the District Court did not take an\naction equivalent to a stay, but rather dismissed this case from\nits docket. It also disputes Verizon\u2019s claim that there are no\nstatute of limitations issues.\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f        \u201cA party generally may not take an appeal under \u00a7 1291\nuntil there has been a decision by the District Court that \u2018ends\nlitigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but\nexecute the judgment.\u2019\u201d Richman Bros.

Ordinarily, an order dismissing a complaint without\nprejudice is not a final order unless the applicable statute of\nlimitations would not permit the re-filing of the claims. Ahmed\nv. Dragovich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778414\"><a href=\"/opinion/778414/ali-ahmed-hiram-mcgill-v-dragovich-superintendent-corrections-secretary/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n        Under this standard, Verizon argues that because the\napplicable statute of limitations for each claim is tolled pursuant\nto an agreement of the parties, Core retains the right to re-plead\nits claims, and thus the District Court\u2019s order is not final under\n\u00a7 1291. However, Core argues that the agreement does not in\nfact cure prospective statute of limitations problems. Verizon\nagreed only to toll the applicable statutes of limitations through\nthis appeal. Under the agreement, it appears that the statutory\nperiods would resume running forty-five days after we enter a\njudgment. They would not continue to toll during the PA PUC\nproceeding. In addition, Verizon specifically reserved the right\nin the agreement to assert a limitations defense against Core\nbased on lapses occurring after this appeal.1\n\n       1\n        During oral argument, counsel for Verizon agreed that\nit would interpret the tolling agreement as extending through the\nproceedings before the PA PUC. However, we will not premise\na refusal to exercise jurisdiction on the representations of one\nattorney when the intent of the parties is so clearly expressed in\nthe agreement, and both parties had all of the relevant\n\n                                10\n\f        Thus, it is far from clear that Core could simply re-plead\nits claims. To the contrary, it seems certain that at least some of\nthe claims will be time barred if Core is forced to litigate its\nclaim for breach of the interconnection agreement before the PA\nPUC. Count I of the complaint, for example, contains a\nlimitations period of two years that began to run in October\n2002, when Verizon failed to interconnect in Wilkes-Barre. See\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 415. Core filed its original complaint on\nSeptember 24, 2004. It would be essentially impossible for the\ntime lapse from the end of this appeal to the re-filing of the\ncomplaint, including time for the PA PUC to make its\ndetermination, to be less than one month. Similarly, Core\u2019s\nclaim advanced in Count II was based on Verizon\u2019s failure to\ninterconnect in Philadelphia in November 2000 and in\nPittsburgh in May 2001. As such, there are eight months\nremaining in the applicable limitations period. See 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1658. In this case, since \u201cthe plaintiff cannot cure the\ndeficiency, an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is\na final and appealable order.\u201d Ahmed, 297 F.3d at 207 (citing\nNewark Branch, NAACP v. Harrison, N.J., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544622\"><a href=\"/opinion/544622/newark-branch-national-association-for-the-advancement-of-colored-people/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1416\n(3d Cir. 1990)). Because the statutes of limitations controlling\nthe claims that Core was not instructed to present to the PA PUC\nwill certainly limit its ability to re-file, we will treat that order\nas final for the purpose of this appeal.\n\n                                III.\n\n\ninformation before them when the agreement was made. That\nis, both Core and Verizon were aware of the possibility of a PA\nPUC proceeding, and chose not to toll the applicable statutes of\nlimitations for that event.\n\n                                 11\n\f        Moving to the merits, the essence of Core\u2019s argument is\nthat it was not required to litigate its claim for breach of the\ninterconnection agreement in front of the PA PUC as an\nintermediate step before the District Court could hear the case.\nThe District Court held, and Verizon argues, that the statutory\nscheme under the Telecommunications Act requires that Core\nfirst present this claim to the state commission before\nproceeding in a federal district court. It reached this conclusion\nby applying Chevron deference to the FCC\u2019s decision in In re\nStarpower Communications. We exercise plenary review over\nsuch claims, which implicate the District Court\u2019s conclusions of\nlaw. See, e.g., Epstein Family P\u2019ship v.

Specifically,\nwe must determine whether a party may proceed directly to\nfederal court to litigate such claims, or if it must first present\nthem to the state commission that originally approved the\n\n\n\n                               13\n\fagreement. We turn to the Telecommunications Act to\ndetermine whether or not Congress has spoken on this question.\n\n       The \u201c[p]rocedures for negotiation, arbitration, and\napproval of [interconnection] agreements\u201d are discussed in\n\u00a7 252 of the Act. Subsection (e), titled \u201cApproval by state\ncommission,\u201d explains the role of state commissions like the PA\nPUC. It provides that \u201c[a]ny interconnection agreement adopted\nby negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to\nthe State commission. A State commission to which an\nagreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement,\nwith written findings as to any deficiencies.\u201d 47 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 252(e)(1). Subsections (e)(2) through (e)(5) list the grounds\nfor rejecting an interconnection agreement submitted to the\ncommission, preserve state authority to establish or enforce\nrequirements of state law in reviewing agreements, set a\ncalendar for state commission decisions, and give the FCC\nauthority to act if the state commission fails to carry out its\nresponsibilities. Finally, \u00a7 252(e)(6) describes the extent of\njudicial review relating to actions under \u00a7 252:\n\n       In a case in which a State fails to act as described\n       in paragraph (5),[2] the proceeding by the\n\n       2\n        Paragraph (5) provides that\n\n       [i]f a State commission fails to act to carry out its\n       responsibility under this section in any proceeding\n       or other matter under this section, then the\n       Commission shall issue an order preempting the\n       State commission\u2019s jurisdiction of that proceeding\n\n                                14\n\f       Commission under such paragraph and any\n       judicial review of the Commission\u2019s actions shall\n       be the exclusive remedies for a State\n       commission\u2019s failure to act. In any case in which\n       a State commission makes a determination under\n       this section, any party aggrieved by such\n       determination may bring an action in an\n       appropriate Federal district court to determine\n       whether the agreement or statement meets the\n       requirements of section 251 of this title and this\n       section.\n\nId. \u00a7 252(e)(6). Beyond this, there is no real indication of what\nrole the state commissions are to play, and the Act is simply\nsilent as to the procedure for post-formation disputes.\n\n        Core, however, argues that Act provides a procedure for\npost-formation disputes in \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207. Section 206 is\nentitled \u201cCarriers\u2019 liability for damages\u201d and provides that\n\n       [i]n case any common carrier shall do, or cause or\n       permit to be done, any act, matter, or thing in this\n       chapter prohibited or declared to be unlawful, or\n\n\n       or matter within 90 days after being notified (or\n       taking notice) of such failure, and shall assume\n       the responsibility of the State commission under\n       this section with respect to the proceeding or\n       matter and act for the State commission.\n\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(e)(5).\n\n                               15\n\f      shall omit to do any act, matter, or thing in this\n      chapter required to be done, such common carrier\n      shall be liable to the person or persons injured\n      thereby for the full amount of damages sustained\n      in consequence of any such violation of the\n      provisions of this chapter, together with a\n      reasonable counsel or attorney\u2019s fee, to be fixed\n      by the court in every case of recovery, which\n      attorney\u2019s fee shall be taxed and collected as part\n      of the costs in the case.\n\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 206. Section 207 is the \u201crecovery of damages\u201d\nprovision related to \u00a7 206. It provides that\n\n      [a]ny person claiming to be damaged by any\n      common carrier subject to the provisions of this\n      chapter may either make complaint to the\n      Commission as hereinafter provided for, or may\n      bring suit for the recovery of the damages for\n      which such common carrier may be liable under\n      the provisions of this chapter, in any district court\n      of the United States of competent jurisdiction; but\n      such person shall not have the right to pursue both\n      such remedies.\n\nId. \u00a7 207. Core argues that these two provisions allow it to\nbring a suit for damages against Verizon in federal court,\nnotwithstanding any authority that may be vested with the state\ncommissions.\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f        However, as Verizon points out, these sections do not\napply to the current dispute because it does not involve the\nprovision of \u201ctelecommunications services.\u201d Both \u00a7 206 and\n\u00a7 207 apply explicitly to claims against \u201ccommon carriers.\u201d\nWhen Congress amended the Act in 1996, it amended the\ndefinition of \u201ccommon carrier\u201d to provide that \u201c[a]\ntelecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common carrier\nunder this chapter only to the extent that it is engaged in\nproviding telecommunications services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(44)\n(emphasis added). According to the Act, \u201c[t]he term\n\u2018telecommunications service\u2019 means the offering of\ntelecommunications[3] for a fee directly to the public, or to such\nclasses of users as to be effectively available directly to the\npublic, regardless of the facilities used.\u201d Id. \u00a7 153(46). We\nagree with Verizon that in providing \u2013 or failing to provide \u2013\ninterconnection, which is defined under \u00a7 251(c)(2) of the Act\nas \u201cthe physical linking of two networks for the mutual\nexchange of traffic,\u201d to another telecommunications carrier it\nwas not providing telecommunications for a fee directly to the\npublic.4 See, e.g., Global Naps, Inc. v. Bell Atl. - N.J., Inc., 287\n\n       3\n        The Act defines \u201ctelecommunications\u201d as \u201cthe\ntransmission, between or among points specified by the user, of\ninformation of the user\u2019s choosing, without change in the form\nor content of the information as sent and received.\u201d 47 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 153(43).\n       4\n        Although, as Core points out, the FCC has reached a\ndifferent conclusion about whether providing interconnection\nservices is included in the definition of telecommunications\nservices under the Act, see TSR Wireless, LLC v.

Had we limited ourselves to\nconsidering portions of the statutory text in isolation, we could\nconclude that Congress meant its statement that \u201c[a]ny\ninterconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or arbitration\nshall be submitted for approval to the State commission,\u201d 47\nU.S.C. \u00a7 252(e)(1), to also imply the contrapositive: that state\ncommissions do not have authority over any issue other than\nwhether to approve or reject interconnection agreements.\nHowever, viewing the statute \u201cas a symmetrical and coherent\nregulatory scheme,\u201d Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529\nU.S. at 133 (quoting Gustafson, 513 U.S. at 569), we are\nreluctant to conclude that Congress would have preserved state\nauthority to such an extent and then cut it off without a more\nexplicit statement.\n\n                               19\n\fCommunications.6 That case involved a dispute between\nStarpower Communications and Bell Atlantic Virginia and GTE\nSouth about whether calls to Internet Service Providers were\n\u201clocal calls\u201d under an approved interconnection agreement. See\n15 F.C.C.R. at 11278. Starpower had asked the Virginia State\nCorporation Commission, the relevant state commission in that\ncase, to issue a declaratory ruling on this point and to order GTE\nto pay reciprocal compensation, but the commission refused.

Although the\nFCC\u2019s decision is susceptible to both narrow and broad\nreadings, under either view it is clearly relevant to the question\nwe must answer here. Under the narrowest interpretation,\nStarpower stands for the proposition that state commissions\nhave, at a minimum, the non-exclusive authority to hear post-\nformation disputes involving approved interconnection\nagreements, despite the Act\u2019s silence on the issue.8 That is,\n\n       8\n        Indeed, every federal appellate court to consider the\nissue has determined or assumed that state commissions have\nthe authority to hear interpretation and enforcement actions\nregarding approved interconnection agreements, despite the\nAct\u2019s silence on that point.

As an initial\nmatter, the FCC\u2019s language \u2013 calling interpretation and\nenforcement disputes part of the states\u2019 \u201cresponsibility\u201d under\n\u00a7 252 \u2013 suggests that there is not a shared role for the federal\ncourts in the first instance. To be fair, the FCC was echoing the\nlanguage in \u00a7 252(e)(5), but in reaching its conclusion it did not\nrely at all on the fact that Starpower had chosen to litigate before\nthe state commission. Rather, it concluded that such a\ndelegation of responsibility best fit the statutory scheme created\nby Congress. In addition, we can find no indication in other\nFCC decisions that the state commissions\u2019 jurisdiction over\npost-formation disputes is shared with the federal courts. To the\ncontrary, every indication is that \u201cthe FCC plainly expects state\ncommissions to decide intermediation and enforcement disputes\nthat arise after the approval procedures are complete.\u201d Sw.

As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit has emphasized,\n\n       [a] state commission\u2019s authority to approve or\n       reject an interconnection agreement would itself\n       be undermined if it lacked authority to determine\n       in the first instance the meaning of an agreement\n       that it has approved. A court might ascribe to the\n       agreement a meaning that differs from what the\n       state commission believed it was approving \u2013\n       indeed, the agreement as interpreted by the court\n       may be one the state commission would never\n\n                              23\n\f       have approved in the first place. To deprive the\n       state commission of authority to interpret the\n       agreement that it has approved would thus subvert\n       the role that Congress prescribed for state\n       commissions.\n\nBellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v.

Huber et al.,\nFederal Telecommunications Law \u00a7 3.3.4 (2d ed. 1999)). The\nFCC\u2019s interpretation wisely recognizes this fact to fill the gap\nleft by Congress.\n\n       Notwithstanding this analysis, Core argues that\nStarpower is not entitled to Chevron deference because\nCongress merely delegated authority to the FCC to preempt\naffirmative refusals by state commissions to carry out their\nresponsibilities under \u00a7 252 of the Act, not to \u201cmandate an\n\u2018interim step\u2019 to federal district court review.\u201d This argument\nmisses the point. Chevron deference is premised on the idea\nthat where Congress has left a gap or ambiguity in a statute\n\n                               24\n\fwithin an agency\u2019s jurisdiction, that agency has the power to fill\nin or clarify the relevant provisions. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-\n44. As we explained above, the Telecommunications Act is\nsilent on the procedure for post-formation disputes. Under\nChevron, this silence coupled with a permissible interpretation\nfrom the Act\u2019s implementing agency is all that is needed for\ndeference. Id. at 843 (\u201c[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous\nwith respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is\nwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.\u201d). Chevron does not require that the\nAct explicitly delegate the authority to the FCC. Rather, it is the\nAct\u2019s silence that is the source of the delegation in this context.\n\n        Core\u2019s next argument is that Starpower is not owed\ndeference because the FCC\u2019s decision was guided by two\n\u201cinstructive\u201d federal appellate court cases, rather than by the\nagency\u2019s expertise. However, a primary source of an agency\u2019s\npower under Chevron deference is delegation, not simply\nexpertise. By not speaking on the subject, Chevron instructs\nthat Congress was implicitly delegating responsibility to the\nFCC to determine the procedure for post-formation disputes.\nSee Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44. Facing the same objection in\nBellSouth, Judge Black of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit explained,\n\n       By virtue of that Congressional delegation, an\n       administrative agency need not cite any cases in\n       reaching its interpretation; its interpretation is\n       authoritative because it has been posited by the\n       agency. Of course, the agency\u2019s interpretation\n       cannot be \u201cprocedurally defective, arbitrary or\n\n                                25\n\f       capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to\n       the statute,\u201d [United States v.] Mead Corp., 533\n       U.S. [218,] 227 [(2001)], and legal errors in the\n       agency\u2019s decision might transgress these limits.\n       Within these boundaries, however, an agency is\n       entitled to deference simply because it has acted.\n\n317 F.3d at 1284 (Black, J., concurring). In addition, it is not\nclear that the FCC was making its decision based only on the\ncases it cited. It also noted in its analysis that \u201cdue to its role in\nthe approval process, a state commission is well-suited to\naddress disputes arising from interconnection agreements.\u201d\nStarpower, 15 F.C.C.R. at 11280. Thus, the force of Starpower\nis not undermined by any reliance on federal cases.\n\n        Finally, Core invokes the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s decision in Murphy\nExploration & Production Co. v. U.S. Department of the\nInterior, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2001), to argue that Starpower\nis not entitled to Chevron deference because an agency is owed\nno deference when limiting federal jurisdiction. However, this\nargument misconstrues the holding in Murphy. There, the court\nconcluded that \u201cChevron does not apply to statutes that . . .\nconfer jurisdiction on the federal courts.\u201d Id. at 478 (emphasis\nadded). As it explained, \u201cwhen Congress has \u2018established an\nenforcement scheme\u2019 that gives a party \u2018direct recourse to\nfederal court,\u2019 it is \u2018inappropriate to consult executive\ninterpretations of [the jurisdiction-conferring statute] to resolve\nambiguities surrounding the scope of [the party\u2019s] judicially\nenforceable remedy.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Adams Fruit Co., Inc. v.\nBarrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112397\"><a href=\"/opinion/112397/adams-fruit-co-v-barrett/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 650 (1990)). We are not faced with such\n\n                                 26\n\fa situation in this case. The FCC in Starpower did not interpret\na statute that conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts, but\nrather one that defined the procedures related to the formation\nof interconnection agreements, and the very reason Chevron\ndeference is an issue in this case is the Act\u2019s silence regarding\nan enforcement scheme. Thus, we see no reason why Chevron\ndeference would be inappropriate here.\n\n        Accordingly, we conclude that the FCC has offered a\nreasonable solution to fill a gap that currently exists in the\nTelecommunications Act. Pursuant to the FCC\u2019s guidance, we\nhold that interpretation and enforcement actions that arise after\na state commission has approved an interconnection agreement\nmust be litigated in the first instance before the relevant state\ncommission. A party may then proceed to federal court to seek\nreview of the commission\u2019s decision or move on to the\nappropriate trial court to seek damages for a breach, if the\ncommission finds one.\n\n                                C.\n\n        Having concluded that Core\u2019s claim for breach of the\ninterconnection agreement must be presented to the PA PUC in\nthe first instance, we now turn to the remainder of its claims.\nWithout discussing anything other than Core\u2019s breach of\ncontract claim, the District Court dismissed Core\u2019s entire\ncomplaint without prejudice. Given our conclusion that the\nrelevant statutes of limitations will certainly limit Core\u2019s ability\nto refile these claims after the PA PUC proceeding, see supra\nSection II, we must consider whether such a step was proper.\nWe conclude that it was not.\n\n                                27\n\f        The District Court did not find, and Verizon does not\nargue, that any of Core\u2019s other claims must be presented to the\nPA PUC, or that the PA PUC even has the authority to hear\nthem. In addition, no party argues that these claims must be\npresented together. As such, the District Court\u2019s action was\ntantamount to dismissing viable claims without any justification.\nCf. Ahmed, 297 F.3d at 207 (\u201c[I]f the plaintiff cannot cure the\ndeficiency, an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is\na final and appealable order.\u201d). We conclude that this was an\nerror. Certainly, as Verizon points out, Core\u2019s claims are all\nrelated, and judicial efficiency would be served by hearing them\nat the same time. To that end, the District Court is free to\nconsider on remand whether or not a stay would be appropriate\nhere. But given the record before us, we conclude that the\nDistrict Court erred by dismissing Core\u2019s claims other than its\naction for breach of the interconnection agreement.\n\n                               IV.\n\n       \u201cIt would be gross understatement to say that the\n[Telecommunications] Act is not a model of clarity. It is in\nmany important respects a model of ambiguity or indeed even\nself-contradiction.\u201d AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils.

L. No. 104-404, 110 Stat. 56 (1996)\n(\u201cTelecommunications Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d). The United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held that\nthe Act prevents parties from taking such claims to federal court\nuntil they have been litigated before a state commission. Core\nCommunications, Inc. (\u201cCore\u201d), argues that the District Court\nerred by misapplying Chevron deference to graft onto the Act an\nexhaustion requirement for enforcement actions when Congress\ndid not provide for one. For the reasons that follow, we will\n\n                                3\n\faffirm the judgment of the District Court dismissing Count III\nof Core\u2019s complaint without prejudice, vacate the dismissal of\nthe remaining counts, and remand for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                               I.\n\n        The dispute in this case centers on the duties an\nincumbent provider of telecommunications services owes with\nrespect to new entrants who wish to compete with the incumbent\nin a particular local market, and how those duties are enforced.\nSuch questions are governed by the Telecommunications Act of\n1996, which was enacted \u201cto promote competition and reduce\nregulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality\nservice for American telecommunications consumers and\nencourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunications\ntechnologies.\u201d Preamble, Telecommunications Act of 1996,\nPub. L. No. 104-404, 110 Stat. 56 (1996). \u201cAs the legislative\nhistory explains, the Act creates \u2018a pro-competitive,\nde-regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate\nrapidly private sector deployment of advanced\ntelecommunications and information technologies and services\nto all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to\ncompetition.\u2019\u201d Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. Telecomms. Regulatory\nBd., 189 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep.\nNo. 104-458, at 113 (1996)).\n\n      To achieve these goals, the Act provides that various\nresponsibilities are to be divided between the state and federal\ngovernments, making it \u201can exercise in what has been termed\ncooperative federalism.\u201d Id. at 8. That is, \u201cCongress enlisted\n\n                               4\n\fthe aid of state public utility commissions to ensure that local\ncompetition was implemented fairly and with due regard to the\nlocal conditions and the particular historical circumstances of\nlocal regulation under the prior regime.\u201d Global Naps, Inc. v.\nMass. Dept. of Telecomm. and Energy, 427 F.3d 34, 46 (1st Cir.\n2005) (quoting Peter W. Huber et al., Federal\nTelecommunications Law \u00a7 3.3.4 (2d ed. 1999)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The \u201cintended effect\u201d of such a\nregime was to \u201cleav[e] state commissions free, where warranted,\nto reflect the policy choices made by their states.\u201d Id.\n\n        There are two sections of the Act that are at issue in this\ncase: \u00a7\u00a7 251 and 252. Section 251 requires companies that\ntraditionally provide local phone service \u2013 known as incumbent\nlocal exchange carriers (\u201cILECs\u201d) \u2013 to interconnect their\nnetworks with the networks of competitors \u2013 known as\ncompeting local exchange carriers (\u201cCLECs\u201d). 47 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 251(c)(2). Specifically, the Act charges ILECs with:\n\n       The duty to provide, for the facilities and\n       equipment of any requesting telecommunications\n       carrier, interconnection with the local exchange\n       carrier\u2019s network--\n\n       (A) for the transmission and routing of telephone\n       exchange service and exchange access;\n\n       (B) at any technically feasible point within the\n       carrier\u2019s network;\n\n\n\n\n                                5\n\f       (C) that is at least equal in quality to that provided\n       by the local exchange carrier to itself or to any\n       subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party to which\n       the carrier provides interconnection; and\n\n       (D) on rates, terms, and conditions that are just,\n       reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, in accordance\n       with the terms and conditions of the agreement\n       and the requirements of this section and section\n       252 of this title.\n\nId. \u00a7 251(c)(2). It also requires ILECs to lease portions of their\nexisting networks to their competitors and to permit the\n\u201cphysical collocation of [CLEC] equipment necessary for\ninterconnection or access to unbundled network elements\u201d at the\nILEC\u2019s premises. Id. \u00a7 251(c)(3), (6). Without these\nrequirements, new entrants could not afford to build the large\nand expensive communications grids that incumbents have\ndeveloped through years in the market.\n\n        To implement these new duties, the Act relies on a\nsystem of private negotiations, followed by arbitration, if\nnecessary, both under the supervision of state commissions. All\nof these steps to attain an interconnection agreement may be\nfollowed by federal court review, if it is sought by the parties.\nThe process commences when an ILEC receives a \u201crequest for\ninterconnection\u201d from another telecommunications company.\nId. \u00a7 252(a)(1). The Act then requires the ILEC to \u201cnegotiate in\ngood faith in accordance with section 252 . . . the particular\nterms and conditions of agreements to fulfill\u201d its substantive\nduties under the Act. Id. \u00a7 252(c)(1). A requesting carrier may\n\n                                 6\n\falso choose to adopt all of the terms and conditions of an\nexisting state commission-approved agreement that the\nincumbent has with another carrier. Id. \u00a7 252(i).\n\n        To deal with problems that may arise during the\nnegotiation period, the Act provides that, if the parties are\nunable to agree, either party may petition the state commission\nto arbitrate \u201copen issues.\u201d Id. \u00a7 252(b)(1). As a final procedural\nsafeguard, all interconnection agreements must be submitted to\nthe state commission for approval. Id. \u00a7 252(e)(1). The\ncommission\u2019s \u201cdeterminations\u201d with respect to the agreements\nare subject to review in federal court. Id. \u00a7 252(e)(6).\n\n       Pursuant to the Act, Core entered into an interconnection\nagreement with Verizon Pennsylvania, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cVerizon\u201d)\npredecessor in interest on March 31, 2000. Rather than\nnegotiating from scratch, Core opted into the existing agreement\nbetween Verizon\u2019s predecessor (Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania,\nInc.) and MCImetro Access Transmission Services, Inc.\n\n       Between the fall of 2000 and October 2002, Core\nrequested interconnection to various markets in Pennsylvania.\nCore alleges that Verizon deliberately and unjustifiably refused\nto interconnect with Core at technically feasible points in a\ntimely manner. Rather than using existing facilities with spare\ncapacity to interconnect, Verizon cited its internal policy of\nrequiring the construction of new, dedicated facilities to\ninterconnect with Core. No technical or business justification\nwas given explaining the need for this requirement. Core claims\nthat Verizon intentionally took these steps in order to maintain\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fits competitive advantage in Pennsylvania markets and to\nintimidate and financially harm Core.\n\n       On September 24, 2004, Core filed the complaint\nunderlying this action in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania. It alleged that Verizon\u2019s\nconduct violated the Telecommunications Act, as amended,\nincluding \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 202 (Count I), and \u00a7 251 (Count II),\nconstituted a material breach of the interconnection agreement\n(Count III), and was tortious under Pennsylvania\u2019s common law\nfor intentional non-disclosure and fraudulent concealment\n(Count IV).\n\n       On November 4, 2004, Verizon filed a motion to dismiss,\nseeking the dismissal of Counts I, II, and IV for failure to state\na claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6), and Count III for lack of jurisdiction\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). On March 21,\n2006, the District Court dismissed Core\u2019s complaint in its\nentirety without prejudice. It reasoned that, although it had\nfederal question and diversity jurisdiction over the action under\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1332, Chevron deference required that\nit adhere to the FCC\u2019s ruling in In re Starpower\nCommunications, LLC, 15 F.C.C.R. 11277 (2000). Under that\ndecision, the District Court concluded that \u00a7 252 of the Act\nimposed \u201can intermediate step before getting to federal court,\nnot unlike an exhaustion of remedies requirement,\u201d with respect\nto interconnection agreement-related claims.           See Core\nCommc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Verizon Pa., Inc., 423 F. Supp. 2d 493, 500\n(E.D. Pa. 2006). That is, it concluded that Core must seek\nreview by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (\u201cPA\n\n                                8\n\fPUC\u201d) of its claim that the approved interconnection agreement\nhad been breached before resorting to the federal courts.\n\n        On April 5, 2006, Core filed a motion for reconsideration\nor amended judgment. Following this motion, Core and Verizon\nentered into a tolling agreement that tolled the statute of\nlimitations on Core\u2019s claims until forty-five days after the entry\nof an order resolving or otherwise disposing of an appeal to this\nCourt from the District Court\u2019s decision. In accordance with\nthat agreement, Core filed a praecipe to withdraw its motion for\nreconsideration or amended judgment on April 19, 2006. In the\nwake of this agreement, Core filed a notice of appeal on\nApril 20, 2006. On April 26, 2006, this Court issued a stay\npending the District Court\u2019s disposition of Core\u2019s motion for\nreconsideration, which was dismissed as moot on May 3, 2006.\nThis appeal followed.\n\n                                II.\n\n        Before moving to any of the claims raised by Core, we\nmust first determine whether or not we have jurisdiction to hear\nthis case. Verizon argues that there is no appellate jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because a district court\u2019s dismissal\nwithout prejudice is not ordinarily a final order unless the\napplicable statute of limitations would not permit the re-filing of\nthe claims. Core, on the other hand, contends that we do have\nappellate jurisdiction because the District Court did not take an\naction equivalent to a stay, but rather dismissed this case from\nits docket. It also disputes Verizon\u2019s claim that there are no\nstatute of limitations issues.\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f        \u201cA party generally may not take an appeal under \u00a7 1291\nuntil there has been a decision by the District Court that \u2018ends\nlitigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but\nexecute the judgment.\u2019\u201d Richman Bros. Records, Inc. v. U.S.\nSprint Comm\u2019ns Co., 953 F.2d 1431, 1441 (3d Cir. 1991)\n(quoting Van Cauwenberge v. Baird, 486 U.S. 517, 521-22\n(1988)). Ordinarily, an order dismissing a complaint without\nprejudice is not a final order unless the applicable statute of\nlimitations would not permit the re-filing of the claims. Ahmed\nv. Dragovich, 297 F.3d 201, 207 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n        Under this standard, Verizon argues that because the\napplicable statute of limitations for each claim is tolled pursuant\nto an agreement of the parties, Core retains the right to re-plead\nits claims, and thus the District Court\u2019s order is not final under\n\u00a7 1291. However, Core argues that the agreement does not in\nfact cure prospective statute of limitations problems. Verizon\nagreed only to toll the applicable statutes of limitations through\nthis appeal. Under the agreement, it appears that the statutory\nperiods would resume running forty-five days after we enter a\njudgment. They would not continue to toll during the PA PUC\nproceeding. In addition, Verizon specifically reserved the right\nin the agreement to assert a limitations defense against Core\nbased on lapses occurring after this appeal.1\n\n       1\n        During oral argument, counsel for Verizon agreed that\nit would interpret the tolling agreement as extending through the\nproceedings before the PA PUC. However, we will not premise\na refusal to exercise jurisdiction on the representations of one\nattorney when the intent of the parties is so clearly expressed in\nthe agreement, and both parties had all of the relevant\n\n                                10\n\f        Thus, it is far from clear that Core could simply re-plead\nits claims. To the contrary, it seems certain that at least some of\nthe claims will be time barred if Core is forced to litigate its\nclaim for breach of the interconnection agreement before the PA\nPUC. Count I of the complaint, for example, contains a\nlimitations period of two years that began to run in October\n2002, when Verizon failed to interconnect in Wilkes-Barre. See\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 415. Core filed its original complaint on\nSeptember 24, 2004. It would be essentially impossible for the\ntime lapse from the end of this appeal to the re-filing of the\ncomplaint, including time for the PA PUC to make its\ndetermination, to be less than one month. Similarly, Core\u2019s\nclaim advanced in Count II was based on Verizon\u2019s failure to\ninterconnect in Philadelphia in November 2000 and in\nPittsburgh in May 2001. As such, there are eight months\nremaining in the applicable limitations period. See 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1658. In this case, since \u201cthe plaintiff cannot cure the\ndeficiency, an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is\na final and appealable order.\u201d Ahmed, 297 F.3d at 207 (citing\nNewark Branch, NAACP v. Harrison, N.J., 907 F.2d 1408, 1416\n(3d Cir. 1990)). Because the statutes of limitations controlling\nthe claims that Core was not instructed to present to the PA PUC\nwill certainly limit its ability to re-file, we will treat that order\nas final for the purpose of this appeal.\n\n                                III.\n\n\ninformation before them when the agreement was made. That\nis, both Core and Verizon were aware of the possibility of a PA\nPUC proceeding, and chose not to toll the applicable statutes of\nlimitations for that event.\n\n                                 11\n\f        Moving to the merits, the essence of Core\u2019s argument is\nthat it was not required to litigate its claim for breach of the\ninterconnection agreement in front of the PA PUC as an\nintermediate step before the District Court could hear the case.\nThe District Court held, and Verizon argues, that the statutory\nscheme under the Telecommunications Act requires that Core\nfirst present this claim to the state commission before\nproceeding in a federal district court. It reached this conclusion\nby applying Chevron deference to the FCC\u2019s decision in In re\nStarpower Communications. We exercise plenary review over\nsuch claims, which implicate the District Court\u2019s conclusions of\nlaw. See, e.g., Epstein Family P\u2019ship v. Kmart Corp., 13 F.3d\n762, 766 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\n        Under Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), federal courts must defer to an\nimplementing agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute within its\njurisdiction if (1) \u201cthe statute is silent or ambiguous with respect\nto the specific issue\u201d at hand, and (2) \u201cthe agency\u2019s answer is\nbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d Id. at 843.\nAs the Supreme Court explained, \u201c[a] court may not substitute\nits own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable\ninterpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d Id. at\n844. \u201cChevron requires a federal court to accept the agency\u2019s\nconstruction of the statute, even if the agency\u2019s reading differs\nfrom what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.\u201d\nNat\u2019l Cable & Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545\nU.S. 967, 980 (2005). The Supreme Court has emphasized that\n\u201c[s]uch deference is justified because \u2018[t]he responsibilities for\nassessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the\nstruggle between competing views of the public interest are not\n\n                                12\n\fjudicial ones,\u2019 and because of the agency\u2019s greater familiarity\nwith the ever-changing facts and circumstances surrounding the\nsubjects regulated.\u201d FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco\nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 132 (2000) (quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at\n866) (internal citations omitted).\n\n                               A.\n\n       Under this framework, the first question we must answer\nis \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question\nat issue.\u201d Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842. In making this\ndetermination, the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201ca\nreviewing court should not confine itself to examining a\nparticular statutory provision in isolation.\u201d        Brown &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. at 133. Instead, we must\ninterpret the statute \u201c\u2018as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory\nscheme,\u2019 and \u2018fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious\nwhole.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561,\n569 (1995); FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U.S. 385, 389\n(1959)). \u201cIn addition, we must be guided to a degree by\ncommon sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to\ndelegate a policy decision of such economic and political\nmagnitude to an administrative agency.\u201d Id.\n\n       In this case, the \u201cprecise question at issue\u201d involves the\nproper procedure for the interpretation and enforcement of\npreviously approved interconnection agreements. Specifically,\nwe must determine whether a party may proceed directly to\nfederal court to litigate such claims, or if it must first present\nthem to the state commission that originally approved the\n\n\n\n                               13\n\fagreement. We turn to the Telecommunications Act to\ndetermine whether or not Congress has spoken on this question.\n\n       The \u201c[p]rocedures for negotiation, arbitration, and\napproval of [interconnection] agreements\u201d are discussed in\n\u00a7 252 of the Act. Subsection (e), titled \u201cApproval by state\ncommission,\u201d explains the role of state commissions like the PA\nPUC. It provides that \u201c[a]ny interconnection agreement adopted\nby negotiation or arbitration shall be submitted for approval to\nthe State commission. A State commission to which an\nagreement is submitted shall approve or reject the agreement,\nwith written findings as to any deficiencies.\u201d 47 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 252(e)(1). Subsections (e)(2) through (e)(5) list the grounds\nfor rejecting an interconnection agreement submitted to the\ncommission, preserve state authority to establish or enforce\nrequirements of state law in reviewing agreements, set a\ncalendar for state commission decisions, and give the FCC\nauthority to act if the state commission fails to carry out its\nresponsibilities. Finally, \u00a7 252(e)(6) describes the extent of\njudicial review relating to actions under \u00a7 252:\n\n       In a case in which a State fails to act as described\n       in paragraph (5),[2] the proceeding by the\n\n       2\n        Paragraph (5) provides that\n\n       [i]f a State commission fails to act to carry out its\n       responsibility under this section in any proceeding\n       or other matter under this section, then the\n       Commission shall issue an order preempting the\n       State commission\u2019s jurisdiction of that proceeding\n\n                                14\n\f       Commission under such paragraph and any\n       judicial review of the Commission\u2019s actions shall\n       be the exclusive remedies for a State\n       commission\u2019s failure to act. In any case in which\n       a State commission makes a determination under\n       this section, any party aggrieved by such\n       determination may bring an action in an\n       appropriate Federal district court to determine\n       whether the agreement or statement meets the\n       requirements of section 251 of this title and this\n       section.\n\nId. \u00a7 252(e)(6). Beyond this, there is no real indication of what\nrole the state commissions are to play, and the Act is simply\nsilent as to the procedure for post-formation disputes.\n\n        Core, however, argues that Act provides a procedure for\npost-formation disputes in \u00a7\u00a7 206 and 207. Section 206 is\nentitled \u201cCarriers\u2019 liability for damages\u201d and provides that\n\n       [i]n case any common carrier shall do, or cause or\n       permit to be done, any act, matter, or thing in this\n       chapter prohibited or declared to be unlawful, or\n\n\n       or matter within 90 days after being notified (or\n       taking notice) of such failure, and shall assume\n       the responsibility of the State commission under\n       this section with respect to the proceeding or\n       matter and act for the State commission.\n\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(e)(5).\n\n                               15\n\f      shall omit to do any act, matter, or thing in this\n      chapter required to be done, such common carrier\n      shall be liable to the person or persons injured\n      thereby for the full amount of damages sustained\n      in consequence of any such violation of the\n      provisions of this chapter, together with a\n      reasonable counsel or attorney\u2019s fee, to be fixed\n      by the court in every case of recovery, which\n      attorney\u2019s fee shall be taxed and collected as part\n      of the costs in the case.\n\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 206. Section 207 is the \u201crecovery of damages\u201d\nprovision related to \u00a7 206. It provides that\n\n      [a]ny person claiming to be damaged by any\n      common carrier subject to the provisions of this\n      chapter may either make complaint to the\n      Commission as hereinafter provided for, or may\n      bring suit for the recovery of the damages for\n      which such common carrier may be liable under\n      the provisions of this chapter, in any district court\n      of the United States of competent jurisdiction; but\n      such person shall not have the right to pursue both\n      such remedies.\n\nId. \u00a7 207. Core argues that these two provisions allow it to\nbring a suit for damages against Verizon in federal court,\nnotwithstanding any authority that may be vested with the state\ncommissions.\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\f        However, as Verizon points out, these sections do not\napply to the current dispute because it does not involve the\nprovision of \u201ctelecommunications services.\u201d Both \u00a7 206 and\n\u00a7 207 apply explicitly to claims against \u201ccommon carriers.\u201d\nWhen Congress amended the Act in 1996, it amended the\ndefinition of \u201ccommon carrier\u201d to provide that \u201c[a]\ntelecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common carrier\nunder this chapter only to the extent that it is engaged in\nproviding telecommunications services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(44)\n(emphasis added). According to the Act, \u201c[t]he term\n\u2018telecommunications service\u2019 means the offering of\ntelecommunications[3] for a fee directly to the public, or to such\nclasses of users as to be effectively available directly to the\npublic, regardless of the facilities used.\u201d Id. \u00a7 153(46). We\nagree with Verizon that in providing \u2013 or failing to provide \u2013\ninterconnection, which is defined under \u00a7 251(c)(2) of the Act\nas \u201cthe physical linking of two networks for the mutual\nexchange of traffic,\u201d to another telecommunications carrier it\nwas not providing telecommunications for a fee directly to the\npublic.4 See, e.g., Global Naps, Inc. v. Bell Atl. - N.J., Inc., 287\n\n       3\n        The Act defines \u201ctelecommunications\u201d as \u201cthe\ntransmission, between or among points specified by the user, of\ninformation of the user\u2019s choosing, without change in the form\nor content of the information as sent and received.\u201d 47 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 153(43).\n       4\n        Although, as Core points out, the FCC has reached a\ndifferent conclusion about whether providing interconnection\nservices is included in the definition of telecommunications\nservices under the Act, see TSR Wireless, LLC v. US West\n\n                                17\n\fF. Supp. 2d 532, 546-47 (D.N.J. 2003); FTC v. Verity Int\u2019l,\n124 F. Supp. 2d 193, 201-02 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (\u201cThe\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 likewise distinguishes\nbetween telecommunications services and information services,\nstating that \u2018a telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a\ncommon carrier under this chapter only to the extent that it is\nengaged in providing telecommunications services.\u2019\u201d (quoting\n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(44))). Sections 206 and 207 are thus\ninapplicable to the case before us. Accordingly, given the lack\nof any guidance as to the proper interpretation and enforcement\n\n\n\n\nCommunications, Inc., 15 F.C.C.R. 11166, 11172 (2000), we\nneed not defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that\nconfers jurisdiction on the federal courts. See Murphy\nExploration & Prod. Co. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, 252 F.3d\n473, 478 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (\u201c[W]hen Congress has \u2018established\nan enforcement scheme\u2019 that gives a party \u2018direct recourse to\nfederal court,\u2019 it is \u2018inappropriate to consult executive\ninterpretations of [the jurisdiction-conferring statute] to resolve\nambiguities surrounding the scope of [the party\u2019s] judicially\nenforceable remedy.\u2019\u201d (quoting Adams Fruit Co., Inc. v. Barrett,\n494 U.S. 638, 650 (1990))).\n\n                                18\n\fprocedure in this case,5 we conclude that Congress has not\nspoken on the precise question at issue here.\n\n                               B.\n\n        Faced with a gap in the relevant statutory scheme, we\nturn to step two of Chevron, which instructs that \u201cif Congress\nhas not specifically addressed the question, a reviewing court\nmust respect the agency\u2019s construction of the statute so long as\nit is permissible.\u201d Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529\nU.S. at 132. In this case, both the District Court and Verizon\nlooked to the FCC\u2019s decision in In re Starpower\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        We emphasize that our conclusion that the Act is silent\non the question at issue here is based on our view of the unusual\nnature of the statutory scheme. Had we limited ourselves to\nconsidering portions of the statutory text in isolation, we could\nconclude that Congress meant its statement that \u201c[a]ny\ninterconnection agreement adopted by negotiation or arbitration\nshall be submitted for approval to the State commission,\u201d 47\nU.S.C. \u00a7 252(e)(1), to also imply the contrapositive: that state\ncommissions do not have authority over any issue other than\nwhether to approve or reject interconnection agreements.\nHowever, viewing the statute \u201cas a symmetrical and coherent\nregulatory scheme,\u201d Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529\nU.S. at 133 (quoting Gustafson, 513 U.S. at 569), we are\nreluctant to conclude that Congress would have preserved state\nauthority to such an extent and then cut it off without a more\nexplicit statement.\n\n                               19\n\fCommunications.6 That case involved a dispute between\nStarpower Communications and Bell Atlantic Virginia and GTE\nSouth about whether calls to Internet Service Providers were\n\u201clocal calls\u201d under an approved interconnection agreement. See\n15 F.C.C.R. at 11278. Starpower had asked the Virginia State\nCorporation Commission, the relevant state commission in that\ncase, to issue a declaratory ruling on this point and to order GTE\nto pay reciprocal compensation, but the commission refused. Id.\nStarpower then asked the FCC to step in and hold that such\ndeterminations were ones that the state commission was required\nto make under \u00a7 252(e)(5).7 Id. at 11277-78. Thus, the FCC\nexplained that it must \u201cdetermine whether a dispute arising from\ninterconnection agreements and seeking interpretation and\nenforcement of those agreements is within the states\u2019\n\u2018responsibility\u2019 under section 252.\u201d Id. at 11279. After posing\n\n\n\n       6\n        Neither party in this case challenges the FCC\u2019s position\nas the agency charged with implementing the\nTelecommunications Act.

Although the\nFCC\u2019s decision is susceptible to both narrow and broad\nreadings, under either view it is clearly relevant to the question\nwe must answer here. Under the narrowest interpretation,\nStarpower stands for the proposition that state commissions\nhave, at a minimum, the non-exclusive authority to hear post-\nformation disputes involving approved interconnection\nagreements, despite the Act\u2019s silence on the issue.8 That is,\n\n       8\n        Indeed, every federal appellate court to consider the\nissue has determined or assumed that state commissions have\nthe authority to hear interpretation and enforcement actions\nregarding approved interconnection agreements, despite the\nAct\u2019s silence on that point.

MCIMetro Access Transmission Servs., Inc.,\n317 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir. 2003) (en banc).\n\n                               21\n\fbecause the case came to the FCC after Starpower had\nvoluntarily attempted to litigate its claim before the Virginia\ncommission, id. at 11278, the FCC\u2019s decision did not actually\nforce a party to bring its post-formation dispute to a state\ncommission before proceeding in federal court.\n\n        However, given the FCC\u2019s behavior and the structure of\nthe statutory scheme as a whole, we believe that more can be\ndrawn from the FCC\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat dispute[s] arising from\ninterconnection agreements and seeking interpretation and\nenforcement of those agreements [are] within the states\u2019\n\u2018responsibility\u2019 under section 252.\u201d Id. at 11279. As an initial\nmatter, the FCC\u2019s language \u2013 calling interpretation and\nenforcement disputes part of the states\u2019 \u201cresponsibility\u201d under\n\u00a7 252 \u2013 suggests that there is not a shared role for the federal\ncourts in the first instance. To be fair, the FCC was echoing the\nlanguage in \u00a7 252(e)(5), but in reaching its conclusion it did not\nrely at all on the fact that Starpower had chosen to litigate before\nthe state commission. Rather, it concluded that such a\ndelegation of responsibility best fit the statutory scheme created\nby Congress. In addition, we can find no indication in other\nFCC decisions that the state commissions\u2019 jurisdiction over\npost-formation disputes is shared with the federal courts. To the\ncontrary, every indication is that \u201cthe FCC plainly expects state\ncommissions to decide intermediation and enforcement disputes\nthat arise after the approval procedures are complete.\u201d Sw. Bell\nTel. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n of Tx., 208 F.3d 475, 480 (5th Cir.\n2000) (citing In re Implementation of the Local Competition\nProvisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 14 F.C.C.R.\n3689, 3703-04 (1999), vacated on other grounds in Bell Atl. Tel.\nCos. v. FCC, 206 F.3d 1 (D.C.

In the context of the Telecommunications Act, we\nbelieve that a \u201csymmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme\u201d is\none where the bodies that considered formation problems also\nresolve interpretation difficulties. As with formation problems,\nfederal court jurisdiction over state commission interpretation\nand enforcement decisions should be limited to appellate review.\nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(e)(6) (granting district courts authority to\nreview \u201cdeterminations\u201d made by the state commissions under\n\u00a7 252). As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh\nCircuit has emphasized,\n\n       [a] state commission\u2019s authority to approve or\n       reject an interconnection agreement would itself\n       be undermined if it lacked authority to determine\n       in the first instance the meaning of an agreement\n       that it has approved. A court might ascribe to the\n       agreement a meaning that differs from what the\n       state commission believed it was approving \u2013\n       indeed, the agreement as interpreted by the court\n       may be one the state commission would never\n\n                              23\n\f       have approved in the first place. To deprive the\n       state commission of authority to interpret the\n       agreement that it has approved would thus subvert\n       the role that Congress prescribed for state\n       commissions.\n\nBellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. MCIMetro Access Transmission\nServs., Inc., 317 F.3d 1270, 1278 n.9 (11th Cir. 2003) (en banc).\nIndeed, as the Eleventh Circuit recognized, to allow parties to\ncircumvent the state commissions in post-formation disputes\nwould undermine the Act\u2019s sense of cooperative federalism,\nunder which the states were given primary responsibility over\ninterconnection agreements. \u201cRather than placing the entire\nscope of regulatory authority in the federal government,\n\u2018Congress enlisted the aid of state public utility commissions to\nensure that local competition was implemented fairly and with\ndue regard to the local conditions and the particular historical\ncircumstances of local regulation under the prior regime.\u2019\u201d\nGlobal Naps, Inc., 427 F.3d at 46 (quoting Peter W. Huber et al.,\nFederal Telecommunications Law \u00a7 3.3.4 (2d ed. 1999)). The\nFCC\u2019s interpretation wisely recognizes this fact to fill the gap\nleft by Congress.\n\n       Notwithstanding this analysis, Core argues that\nStarpower is not entitled to Chevron deference because\nCongress merely delegated authority to the FCC to preempt\naffirmative refusals by state commissions to carry out their\nresponsibilities under \u00a7 252 of the Act, not to \u201cmandate an\n\u2018interim step\u2019 to federal district court review.\u201d This argument\nmisses the point. Chevron deference is premised on the idea\nthat where Congress has left a gap or ambiguity in a statute\n\n                               24\n\fwithin an agency\u2019s jurisdiction, that agency has the power to fill\nin or clarify the relevant provisions. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-\n44. As we explained above, the Telecommunications Act is\nsilent on the procedure for post-formation disputes. Under\nChevron, this silence coupled with a permissible interpretation\nfrom the Act\u2019s implementing agency is all that is needed for\ndeference. Id. at 843 (\u201c[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous\nwith respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is\nwhether the agency\u2019s answer is based on a permissible\nconstruction of the statute.\u201d). Chevron does not require that the\nAct explicitly delegate the authority to the FCC. Rather, it is the\nAct\u2019s silence that is the source of the delegation in this context.\n\n        Core\u2019s next argument is that Starpower is not owed\ndeference because the FCC\u2019s decision was guided by two\n\u201cinstructive\u201d federal appellate court cases, rather than by the\nagency\u2019s expertise. However, a primary source of an agency\u2019s\npower under Chevron deference is delegation, not simply\nexpertise. By not speaking on the subject, Chevron instructs\nthat Congress was implicitly delegating responsibility to the\nFCC to determine the procedure for post-formation disputes.\nSee Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-44. Facing the same objection in\nBellSouth, Judge Black of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit explained,\n\n       By virtue of that Congressional delegation, an\n       administrative agency need not cite any cases in\n       reaching its interpretation; its interpretation is\n       authoritative because it has been posited by the\n       agency. Of course, the agency\u2019s interpretation\n       cannot be \u201cprocedurally defective, arbitrary or\n\n                                25\n\f       capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to\n       the statute,\u201d [United States v.] Mead Corp., 533\n       U.S. [218,] 227 [(2001)], and legal errors in the\n       agency\u2019s decision might transgress these limits.\n       Within these boundaries, however, an agency is\n       entitled to deference simply because it has acted.\n\n317 F.3d at 1284 (Black, J., concurring). In addition, it is not\nclear that the FCC was making its decision based only on the\ncases it cited. It also noted in its analysis that \u201cdue to its role in\nthe approval process, a state commission is well-suited to\naddress disputes arising from interconnection agreements.\u201d\nStarpower, 15 F.C.C.R. at 11280. Thus, the force of Starpower\nis not undermined by any reliance on federal cases.\n\n        Finally, Core invokes the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s decision in Murphy\nExploration & Production Co. v. U.S. Department of the\nInterior, 252 F.3d 473 (D.C. Cir. 2001), to argue that Starpower\nis not entitled to Chevron deference because an agency is owed\nno deference when limiting federal jurisdiction. However, this\nargument misconstrues the holding in Murphy. There, the court\nconcluded that \u201cChevron does not apply to statutes that . . .\nconfer jurisdiction on the federal courts.\u201d Id. at 478 (emphasis\nadded). As it explained, \u201cwhen Congress has \u2018established an\nenforcement scheme\u2019 that gives a party \u2018direct recourse to\nfederal court,\u2019 it is \u2018inappropriate to consult executive\ninterpretations of [the jurisdiction-conferring statute] to resolve\nambiguities surrounding the scope of [the party\u2019s] judicially\nenforceable remedy.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Adams Fruit Co., Inc. v.\nBarrett, 494 U.S. 638, 650 (1990)). We are not faced with such\n\n                                 26\n\fa situation in this case. The FCC in Starpower did not interpret\na statute that conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts, but\nrather one that defined the procedures related to the formation\nof interconnection agreements, and the very reason Chevron\ndeference is an issue in this case is the Act\u2019s silence regarding\nan enforcement scheme. Thus, we see no reason why Chevron\ndeference would be inappropriate here.\n\n        Accordingly, we conclude that the FCC has offered a\nreasonable solution to fill a gap that currently exists in the\nTelecommunications Act. Pursuant to the FCC\u2019s guidance, we\nhold that interpretation and enforcement actions that arise after\na state commission has approved an interconnection agreement\nmust be litigated in the first instance before the relevant state\ncommission. A party may then proceed to federal court to seek\nreview of the commission\u2019s decision or move on to the\nappropriate trial court to seek damages for a breach, if the\ncommission finds one.\n\n                                C.\n\n        Having concluded that Core\u2019s claim for breach of the\ninterconnection agreement must be presented to the PA PUC in\nthe first instance, we now turn to the remainder of its claims.\nWithout discussing anything other than Core\u2019s breach of\ncontract claim, the District Court dismissed Core\u2019s entire\ncomplaint without prejudice. Given our conclusion that the\nrelevant statutes of limitations will certainly limit Core\u2019s ability\nto refile these claims after the PA PUC proceeding, see supra\nSection II, we must consider whether such a step was proper.\nWe conclude that it was not.\n\n                                27\n\f        The District Court did not find, and Verizon does not\nargue, that any of Core\u2019s other claims must be presented to the\nPA PUC, or that the PA PUC even has the authority to hear\nthem. In addition, no party argues that these claims must be\npresented together. As such, the District Court\u2019s action was\ntantamount to dismissing viable claims without any justification.\nCf. Ahmed, 297 F.3d at 207 (\u201c[I]f the plaintiff cannot cure the\ndeficiency, an order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is\na final and appealable order.\u201d). We conclude that this was an\nerror. Certainly, as Verizon points out, Core\u2019s claims are all\nrelated, and judicial efficiency would be served by hearing them\nat the same time. To that end, the District Court is free to\nconsider on remand whether or not a stay would be appropriate\nhere. But given the record before us, we conclude that the\nDistrict Court erred by dismissing Core\u2019s claims other than its\naction for breach of the interconnection agreement.\n\n                               IV.\n\n       \u201cIt would be gross understatement to say that the\n[Telecommunications] Act is not a model of clarity. It is in\nmany important respects a model of ambiguity or indeed even\nself-contradiction.\u201d AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 525 U.S.\n366, 397 (1999). Nevertheless, we are charged with piecing\ntogether what Congress and the FCC have given us. Until we\nhave more guidance on the matter, the most sensible\nharmonization of the Act\u2019s structure and the FCC\u2019s declarations\nis a solution under which the bodies that are responsible for\noverseeing the formation of interconnection agreements are\ngiven the first crack at interpreting and enforcing them. The\nimperfections of this procedure are not lost on us, but it appears\n\n                               28\n\fto be the solution most faithful to the FCC\u2019s gap-filling\nauthority and the Act\u2019s assignment to the state commissions of\nresponsibilities related to interconnection agreements.\nAccordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court\ndismissing Count III of Core\u2019s complaint without prejudice,\nvacate the dismissal of the remaining counts, and remand for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                             29\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "1dc4345acdf33db172c9e34bd40d030a11637aec", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/20372/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/105881/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111221/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112092/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112397/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/117902/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118260/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118347/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118450/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/118506/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/160487/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/185105/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/198599/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/544622/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/660196/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/744536/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/764713/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/772087/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/778414/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/780682/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/792254/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/799969/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2415298/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2569508/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2015-10-13T22:40:19.703489Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 30, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/3028321/core-comm-inc-v-verizon-pa-inc/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "3028321", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Core Comm Inc v.
