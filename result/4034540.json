Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2698 et seq.), alleging\nthat U-Haul Company of California (U-Haul) violated several provisions of the Labor\nCode, including overtime and meal break requirements. U-Haul filed a motion to compel\nplaintiffs to individually arbitrate whether they qualified as \u201caggrieved employee[s],\u201d\nand therefore had standing to pursue a PAGA claim. (See Labor Code, \u00a7 2699, subd.\n(a).) U-Haul asserted that all other issues regarding the PAGA claim should be stayed\npending resolution of the arbitration. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that\nCalifornia law prohibits an employer from compelling an employee to split the litigation\nof a PAGA claim between multiple forums. We affirm.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       A. Events Preceding the Motion to Compel Arbitration\n       In 2010 and 2011, U-Haul hired plaintiffs Erick Veliz and Sergio Perez\n(collectively plaintiffs) to serve as customer service representatives. As a condition of\ntheir employment, plaintiffs signed a mandatory arbitration agreement that contained the\nfollowing language: \u201cI agree that it is my obligation to . . . submit to final and binding\narbitration any and all claims and disputes . . . that are related in any way to my\nemployment . . . . [B]y agreeing to use arbitration to resolve my dispute, both U-Haul and\nI agree to . . . forego any right to bring claims as a representative or as a member of a\nclass or in a private attorney general capacity. . . .\u201d A separate provision stated that the\nagreement was \u201cgoverned by the Federal Arbitration Act [FAA], 9 U.S.C. et seq.\u201d\n       In 2012, plaintiffs each filed a class action complaint against U-Haul for\nvarious Labor Code violations including (among other things) unpaid overtime (Labor\nCode, \u00a7\u00a7 510, 1194 and 11981), failure to provide meal breaks (\u00a7226.7), failure to pay\nminimum wages (\u00a7\u00a7 1194, 1194.2, 1197, 1197.1), failure to pay wages in a timely\nmanner (\u00a7 204) and failure to provide accurate wage statements (\u00a7 226, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n1      Unless otherwise noted, all further statutory citations are to the Labor Code.\n\n                                              2\n\fVeliz\u2019s complaint additionally alleged a representative PAGA action seeking to collect\npenalties \u201con behalf of all other . . . [a]ggrieved [e]mployees.\u201d\n       The trial court granted a petition to coordinate the actions, and stayed the matter\npending the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Iskanian v. CLS Transportation Los\nAngeles, LLC (2014) 59 Cal.4th 348 (Iskanian). After Iskanian was decided, the\nplaintiffs each filed an amended complaint that alleged a single cause of action under\nPAGA seeking to collect penalties on behalf of themselves and other \u201caggrieved\nemployees\u201d for various Labor Code violations.\n\n       B. U-Haul\u2019s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs to Arbitrate Whether they Are\n          \u201cAggrieved Employees\u201d Within the Meaning of PAGA\n\n       On September 22, 2014, U-Haul filed motions seeking to compel plaintiffs to\nindividually arbitrate the \u201cpredicate issue of whether\u201d they had personally been subjected\nto any Labor Code violation, and therefore had standing to assert a PAGA claim. As\nstated in U-Haul\u2019s motions: \u201cStanding under PAGA requires that the plaintiff be an\n\u2018aggrieved employee\u2019 in order to bring a claim for statutory penalties on behalf of himself\nand other employees. [Citation] The Labor Code defines \u2018aggrieved employee\u2019 as \u2018any\nperson who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the\nallege violations was committed.\u2019 [Citation] [\u00b6] Whether plaintiff is an \u2018aggrieved\nemployee\u2019 will require a determination of whether U-Haul committed Labor Code\nviolations against him, specifically, whether U-Haul was allegedly in violation of\nCalifornia Labor Codes.\u201d U-Haul further asserted that the \u201crepresentative portion\u201d of the\nPAGA claims, which included \u201cthe number, scope and identities of other \u2018aggrieved\nemployees\u2019 . . . . and the amount of representative penalties,\u201d were \u201cnon-arbitrable\u201d under\nthe employment agreement, and should be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.\n       Plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing that the California Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Iskanian made clear that \u201cclaims brought pursuant to PAGA are not arbitrable\nin any manner whatsoever, as it is against public policy.\u201d Plaintiffs further contended\nthat if every employee could be compelled to arbitrate \u201cwhether [he or she had] suffered\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthe underlying Labor Code violations to establish that [he or she is an] aggrieved\nemployee,\u201d Iskanian would be rendered \u201cmeaningless as . . . then this argument could be\napplied to . . . require every [employee] to first arbitrate whether they are a true\n\u2018aggrieved employee.\u2019\u201d\n       In reply, U-Haul argued that Iskanian did \u201cnot hold that part of a PAGA claim\ncannot be arbitrated or that the predicate issue of whether U-Haul committed Labor Code\nviolations against [plaintiff] cannot be arbitrated. Instead, Iskanian requires [only] that\n\u2018aggrieved employees\u2019 be allowed to bring representative PAGA actions.\u201d U-haul further\ncontended that the employment agreement was governed by the FAA, which explicitly\n\u201cauthorizes the severance of arbitrable issues from non-arbitrable issues.\u201d U-Haul argued\nthat several federal decisions applying the FAA had held that when a single claim raises\n\u201c\u2018both arbitrable issues and nonarbitrable issues,\u2019\u201d the court must \u201csever[] the arbitrable\nissues.\u201d According to U-Haul, because plaintiffs\u2019 status as \u201caggrieved employee[s]\u201d was\nan \u201carbitrable issue\u201d under the employment agreement, the FAA required that the issue to\nbe severed from the remaining \u201crepresentative\u201d issues of the PAGA claim.\nAfter a hearing, the court entered an order concluding there was no legal basis to compel\narbitration \u201cof the predicate issue of whether U-Haul committed Labor Code violations\nagainst Plaintiffs.\u201d The court explained that Iskanian had \u201cspoken on this issue and\ndetermined that the FAA does not apply to PAGA . . . [\u00b6] Contrary to defendant\u2019s\narguments . . ., the Iskanian Court was unequivocal in finding that a PAGA claim is not\nsubject to the [FAA]. That is the dispute is, in fact, between the State and the employer.\nThus, the federal cases [regarding severance] cited by Defendant, which all rely on the\nFAA, are distinguishable.\u201d The trial court further explained that other California\ndecisions had held that PAGA claims can only be brought in a representative capacity,\nand \u201cnot [as] an individual [claim]. . . . As such, there is no basis for individuals to\narbitrate whether they are individual \u2018aggrieved employees\u2019 before proceeding to [a trial\non the remainder of the PAGA claim]. [B]ecause the [plaintiffs\u2019] PAGA claim is (1)\noutside the FAA, and (2) not an individual claim, there is no basis to compel arbitration\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fto first determine whether the representative plaintiffs are \u2018aggrieved employees\u2019 under\nPAGA.\u201d\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       A. Standard of Review and Summary of the Issue on Appeal\n       An order denying a petition to compel arbitration is appealable. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n\u00a7 1294, subd. (a).) \u201cIn general, \u2018[t]here is no uniform standard of review for evaluating an\norder denying a [petition] to compel arbitration. [Citation.] If the court\u2019s order is based\non a decision of fact, then we adopt a substantial evidence standard. [Citations.]\nAlternatively, if the court\u2019s denial rests solely on a decision of law, then a de novo\nstandard of review is employed. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Laswell v. AG Seal Beach,\nLLC (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1399, 1406.)\n       The parties do not dispute that: (1) the parties entered into a valid, enforceable\narbitration agreement that is governed by the FAA; (2) the agreement\u2019s provision\nprecluding employees from asserting a representative PAGA claim is unenforceable as a\nmatter of California law (see Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 384); and (3) the parties did\nnot contemplate arbitrating a representative PAGA action, meaning that the\nrepresentative claim must proceed in court. They disagree, however, whether the\nagreement nonetheless requires plaintiffs to individually arbitrate whether they qualify as\n\u201caggrieved employee[s],\u201d and therefore have standing to bring a representative PAGA\naction on behalf of \u201cother current or former employees.\u201d (See \u00a7 2699, subd. (a).)2 For\nthe purposes of PAGA, an \u201caggrieved employee\u201d is defined to \u201cmean[] any person who\nwas employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the alleged\n[Labor Code] violations was committed.\u201d (\u00a7 2699, subd. (c).)\n\n\n\n2      Section 2699, subdivision (a) states, in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other\nprovision of law, any provision of this code that provides for a civil penalty to be\nassessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency . . . , for a\nviolation of this code, may, as an alternative, be recovered through a civil action brought\nby an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former\nemployees pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 2699.3.\u201d\n\n                                              5\n\f       Plaintiffs contend the analysis and reasoning in Iskanian makes clear that\nemployers are not permitted to compel employees to arbitrate any aspect of a PAGA\nclaim, including the question whether they qualify as aggrieved employees. U-Haul\ndisagrees, arguing that Iskanian merely held that PAGA waivers in arbitration\nagreements are unenforceable as a matter of state law, and that the FAA does not preempt\nthis rule. U-Haul further contends that, in this case, it is not seeking to preclude plaintiffs\nfrom pursuing a representative PAGA claim, but rather is seeking only to arbitrate the\nplaintiffs\u2019 individual standing to bring a PAGA claim. If the arbitrator determines the\nplaintiffs are aggrieved employees within the meaning of PAGA, they may then proceed\nwith their representative action in the superior court.\n\n       B. Summary of Iskanian v. CLS Transportation\n\n       The issues in this appeal turn largely on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in\nIskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th 348. The plaintiff in Iskanian filed a class action against his\nemployer for unpaid overtime and various other Labor Code violations. The complaint\nalso alleged a representative claim under the PAGA seeking penalties on behalf of all\naggrieved employees. The employer moved to compel individual arbitration of each\nclaim, contending that plaintiff had signed an employment agreement that contained a\nwaiver of his right to pursue class or representative claims.\n       While the motion was pending, the California Supreme Court issued Gentry v.\nSuperior Court (2007) 42 Cal.4th 443, which held that \u201cclass action waivers in\nemployment arbitration agreements are invalid under certain circumstances.\u201d (Iskanian,\nsupra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 361.) The employer subsequently withdrew its motion to compel\narbitration, and the parties proceeded to litigate the case. After the plaintiff had obtained\na class certification order, the United States Supreme Court issued AT & T Mobility LLC\nv. Concepcion (2011) 563 U.S. 333 (Concepcion ), which invalidated a prior California\nSupreme Court decision that \u201crestricted consumer class action waivers in arbitration\nagreements.\u201d (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 361 [discussing Discover Bank v.\nSuperior Court (2005) 36 Cal.4th 148].) The employer then renewed its motion to\n\n\n                                               6\n\fcompel individual arbitration, arguing that Concepcion had invalidated Gentry\u2019s state law\nrule precluding the enforcement of class action waivers. The trial court granted the\nmotion, ordered the case into individual arbitration and dismissed the class and\nrepresentative claims. The Court of Appeal affirmed.\n       The California Supreme Court agreed that the principles set forth in Concepcion\nmade clear that the FAA preempted Gentry\u2019s state law rule precluding the enforcement of\nclass arbitration waivers in employment agreements. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\np. 362.) The Court explained that Concepcion had two central holdings: (1) the FAA\npreempts state rules that are incompatible with the fundamental attributes of arbitration;\nand (2) classwide arbitration interferes with numerous attributes of arbitration, including\nits expediency and informality. The Court concluded that in light of these holdings, the\n\u201cGentry rule\u201d was no longer valid. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 366.)\n       The Court next considered whether state law prohibited the enforcement of\nrepresentative PAGA claim waivers in employment agreements, and, if so, whether the\nFAA preempted application of such a prohibition. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\npp. 361.) The court began its analysis by summarizing the purpose and structure of\nPAGA: \u201cThe Legislature declared that adequate financing of labor law enforcement was\nnecessary to achieve maximum compliance with state labor laws, that staffing levels for\nlabor law enforcement agencies had declined and were unlikely to keep pace with the\nfuture growth of the labor market, and that it was therefore in the public interest to allow\naggrieved employees, acting as private attorneys general, to recover civil penalties for\nLabor Code violations, with the understanding that labor law enforcement agencies were\nto retain primacy over private enforcement efforts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Id. at p. 379.) To\nachieve those goals, PAGA authorizes \u201can \u2018aggrieved employee\u2019 [to] bring a civil action\npersonally and on behalf of other current or former employees to recover civil penalties\nfor Labor Code violations. [Citation.] Of the civil penalties recovered, 75 percent goes\nto the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, leaving the remaining 25 percent for\nthe \u201caggrieved employees.\u201d [Citations.] [\u00b6] Before bringing a civil action for statutory\npenalties, an employee must . . . give written notice of the alleged Labor Code violation\n\n                                              7\n\fto both the employer and the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. . . . If the\nagency does not intend to investigate . . . , the employee may commence a civil action.\n[Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Id. at p. 380.)\n       The Court explained that the purpose and structure of the PAGA statute\ndemonstrated that \u201c\u2018[a]n employee plaintiff suing . . . under the [statute] does so as the\nproxy or agent of the state\u2019s labor law enforcement agencies . . . . In a lawsuit brought\nunder the act, the employee plaintiff represents the same legal right and interest as state\nlabor law enforcement agencies\u2014namely, recovery of civil penalties that otherwise\nwould have been assessed and collected by the Labor Workforce Development Agency.\n[Citations.] . . . . [\u00b6] . . . . [Thus, a]n action to recover civil penalties \u2018is fundamentally a\nlaw enforcement action designed to protect the public and not to benefit private parties\u2019\n[Citation.] . . . .[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . . The government entity on whose behalf the plaintiff files\nsuit is always the real party in interest in the suit.\u201d (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\npp. 380-382)\n       The Court concluded that in light of these \u201clegal characteristics\u201d (Iskanian, supra,\n59 Cal.4th at p. 380), \u201can employee\u2019s right to bring a PAGA action is unwaivable.\u201d\nHence, an employer cannot compel an employee to waive his right to bring a\nrepresentative PAGA claim through an agreement. The Court reasoned that because \u201cthe\nLegislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the PAGA was to augment the limited enforcement\ncapability of the Labor and Workforce Development Agency by empowering employees\nto enforce the Labor Code as representatives of the Agency,\u201d a PAGA waiver \u201cserve[d]\nto disable one of the primary mechanisms for enforcing the Labor Code. . . . [\u00b6]. . . . The\nPAGA was clearly established for a public reason, and agreements requiring the waiver\nof PAGA rights would harm the state\u2019s interests in enforcing the Labor Code and in\nreceiving the proceeds of civil penalties used to deter violations.\u201d (Id. at p. 383.)\n       The Court further explained that the representative waiver at issue was against\npublic policy even though the plaintiff retained his right to arbitrate a single-claimant\nPAGA claim on behalf of himself and the state: \u201c[A] prohibition of representative\nclaims frustrates the PAGA\u2019s objectives . . . [because] a single-claimant arbitration . . .\n\n                                                 8\n\ffor individual penalties will not result in the penalties contemplated under the PAGA to\npunish and deter employer practices that violate the rights of numerous employees under\nthe Labor Code. That plaintiff and other employees might be able to bring individual\nclaims for Labor Code violations in separate arbitrations does not serve the purpose of the\nPAGA, even if an individual claim has collateral estoppel effects. [Citation.] Other\nemployees would still have to assert their claims in individual proceedings.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d\n(Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at pp. 383-384.)\n       Finally, the Court considered whether the FAA preempted this rule of California\nlaw, concluding that it did not: \u201cConcepcion made clear [that] a state law rule may be\npreempted when it \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\u2019s\nobjectives.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . [T]he rule against PAGA waivers does not frustrate the\nFAA\u2019s objectives because . . . the FAA aims to ensure an efficient forum for the\nresolution of private disputes, whereas a PAGA action is a dispute between an employer\nand the state Agency. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Simply put, a PAGA claim lies outside the FAA\u2019s\ncoverage because it is not a dispute between an employer and an employee arising out of\ntheir contractual relationship. It is a dispute between an employer and the state, which\nalleges directly or through its agents\u2014either the Labor and Workforce Development\nAgency or aggrieved employees\u2014that the employer has violated the Labor Code. . . .\u201d\n(Id. at pp. 384-387.)\n\n       C. The Trial Court Correctly Concluded Plaintiffs Are Not Required to\n          Individually Arbitrate Whether they Qualify as \u201cAggrieved Employees\u201d\n\n       Like the arbitration agreement at issue in Iskanian, U-Haul\u2019s employment\nagreement contains language stating that: (1) the employee must arbitrate \u201cany and all\nclaims and disputes . . . that are in any way related to [his or her] employment\u201d; and (2)\nboth parties \u201cshall forego any right to bring claims as a representative or as a member of\na class or in a private attorney general capacity.\u201d U-Haul concedes that under Iskanian,\nthe PAGA waiver is not enforceable, and that plaintiffs are therefore permitted to proceed\nwith their PAGA action in court.\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       U-Haul contends, however, that the plaintiffs may nonetheless be compelled to\nindividually arbitrate the \u201cpredicate issue of whether\u201d they are \u201caggrieved employee[s]\nwithin the meaning of PAGA, and thus have standing to bring . . . representative\nclaim[s].\u201d According to U-Haul, if the arbitrator determines it did \u201ccommit[] Labor Code\nviolations against [plaintiffs]\u201d (thereby establishing standing), plaintiffs may then pursue\ntheir \u201crepresentative PAGA claim [in court], e.g., . . . the number, scope and identities of\nother \u2018aggrieved employees\u2019 that [plaintiffs] will represent, and the amount of\nrepresentative penalties.\u201d Stated more simply, U-Haul argues that although \u201cneither\n[party] agreed to arbitrate representative issues, and neither may be compelled to\nparticipate in a representative arbitration,\u201d plaintiffs may be compelled to individually\narbitrate whether they have standing to bring such a representative claim.\n\n           1. Whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue a PAGA claim is not an issue\n              that falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement\n\n       Preliminarily, we address whether the particular issue U-Haul seeks to\narbitrate\u2015plaintiffs\u2019 status as \u201caggrieved employees\u201d with standing to bring a PAGA\nclaim\u2015actually falls within the scope of the parties\u2019 employment agreement. \u201cThe scope\nof arbitration is a matter of agreement between the parties. [Citations.] A party can be\ncompelled to arbitrate only those issues it has agreed to arbitrate. [Citations.]\u201d (Larkin v.\nWilliams, Woolley, Cogswell, Nakazawa & Russell (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 227, 230\n(Larkin); see also Hayes Children Leasing Co. v. NCR Corp. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 775,\n787 (Hayes) [\u201c[plaintiff], of course, can be compelled to arbitrate only such issues as it in\nfact agreed to arbitrate\u201d].) \u201cAny ambiguity in the scope of the arbitration, however, will\nbe resolved in favor of arbitration.\u201d (Hayes, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 788; see also\nLarkin, supra, 76 Cal.App.4th at p. 230 [\u201cdoubts as to the scope of an agreement to\narbitrate are to be resolved in favor of arbitration\u201d].)\n       In support of its assertion that plaintiffs agreed to arbitrate whether they had\nstanding to bring a PAGA claim, U-Haul relies on a broadly-worded clause stating that\nthe parties would arbitrate \u201cany and all claims and disputes . . . in any way related to\n\n\n                                              10\n\f[plaintiffs\u2019] employment.\u201d U-Haul contends that because plaintiffs\u2019 standing to bring a\nPAGA claim involves issues related to their employment, the arbitration provision\nnecessarily applies. The agreement, however, contains an additional clause stating\nthat the parties would not seek arbitration (or litigation) of any \u201cclaims as a representative\n. . . or in a private attorney general capacity.\u201d U-Haul acknowledges that this language\ndemonstrates neither party agreed (nor could be compelled) to arbitrate representative\nclaims. Iskanian, in turn, held that every PAGA action, including one brought on behalf\nof a single employee, is a representative claim. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 387\n[\u201cevery PAGA action, whether seeking penalties for Labor Code violations as to only one\naggrieved employee\u2014the plaintiff bringing the action\u2014or as to other employees as well,\nis a representative action on behalf of the state\u201d] [emphasis in original].) Given that the\nparties did not agree to arbitrate representative claims, and that a PAGA action is by\ndefinition a form of representative claim, we conclude that PAGA claims are\ncategorically excluded from the arbitration agreement. Moreover, the agreement contains\nno language suggesting that despite this exclusion of representative claims, the parties did\nagree to arbitrate whether the complaining party had standing to initiate a representative\nclaim in court. We fail to see how an agreement that excludes representative claims can\nnonetheless be reasonably interpreted to require plaintiffs to arbitrate their standing to\nbring a representative claim.\n\n          2. Even if the agreement does require plaintiffs to arbitrate whether they have\n             standing to bring a PAGA claim, the provision is unenforceable under\n             California law\n\n       Even if we were to accept U-Haul\u2019s interpretation of the employment agreement,\nwe are not aware of any authority supporting its argument that an employer may legally\ncompel an employee to arbitrate the individual aspects of his or her PAGA claim, while\nsimultaneously preserving its own right to litigate the representative aspects of the claim\nin court. The only decision that has addressed the issue, Williams v. Superior Court\n(2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 642 (Williams), held that an employer could not force employees\nto proceed in such a manner. As in this case, the plaintiff in Williams signed an\n\n                                             11\n\farbitration agreement that contained a waiver of his right to assert a representative claim.\nThe plaintiff subsequently a filed \u201ca single-count [PAGA] action\u201d alleging that his\nemployer had \u201cfailed to provide off-duty rest periods, as required by section 226.7.\u201d\n(Id. at pp. 644-645.) The employer \u201cmoved . . . for an order staying the PAGA claim, but\nsending the \u2018individual claim\u2019 that [plaintiff] had been subjected to Labor Code violations\nto arbitration.\u201d (Id. at p. 645.) The trial court granted the motion, explaining that while\nIskanian precluded the employer from \u201cforc[ing] [plaintiff] to waive or arbitrate his\nPAGA claim[,] . . . the \u2018threshold dispute between plaintiff . . . and his former employer\nas to whether or not he was denied off-duty rest periods\u2019 [was] . . . \u2018amenable to\narbitration under Iskanian.\u2019\u201d (Id. at p. 646.)\n       The appellate court reversed, concluding there was no basis for the trial court\u2019s\n\u201cdetermin[ation] that [the plaintiff] must submit the \u2018underlying controversy\u2019 to\narbitration for a determination whether he is an \u2018aggrieved employee\u2019 under the Labor\nCode with standing to bring a representative PAGA claim. [Citation.]\u201d (Williams, supra,\n237 Cal.App.4th at p. 647.) The court noted that neither the employer nor the trial court\nhad \u201ccited [any] legal authority . . . that a single representative action may be split in such\na manner. . . . Indeed, case law suggests that a single representative PAGA claim cannot\nbe split into an arbitrable individual claim and a nonarbitrable representative claim\nbrought solely on the employee\u2019s behalf [because every] . . . . PAGA claim [is\nbrought] . . . \u2018as the proxy or agent of the state\u2019s labor law enforcement agencies.\u201d\n[Citation.]\u2019 Accordingly, petitioner cannot be compelled to submit any portion of his\nrepresentative PAGA claim to arbitration, including whether he was an \u2018aggrieved\nemployee.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Id. at p. 649 [emphasis in original].)\n       We agree with Williams\u2019s conclusion that California law prohibits the enforcement\nof an employment agreement provision that requires an employee to individually arbitrate\nwhether he or she qualifies as an \u201caggrieved employee\u201d under PAGA, and then (if\nsuccessful) to litigate the remainder of the \u201crepresentative action in the superior court.\u201d\nIn Iskanian, the Supreme Court explained that \u201cevery PAGA action, whether seeking\npenalties for Labor Code violations as to only one aggrieved employee\u2015the plaintiff\n\n                                              12\n\fbringing the action\u2014or as to other employees as well, is a representative action on\nbehalf of the state.\u201d (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 387.) The Court also held that\nrequiring an employee to bring a PAGA claim in his or her \u201cindividual\u201d capacity, rather\nthan in a \u201crepresentative\u201d capacity, would undermine the purposes of the statute. (Id. at\npp. 383-384.) Given these conclusions, we do not believe an employer may force an\nemployee to split a PAGA claim into \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201crepresentative\u201d components, with\neach being litigated in a different forum.\n       Moreover, the reasoning of Iskanian indicates that an employer is not permitted to\nimpose arbitration provisions that impede an aggrieved employee\u2019s ability to bring a\nPAGA claim, which is \u201c\u2018fundamentally a law enforcement action designed to protect the\npublic. . . . \u2019 [Citation].\u201d (See Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at pp. 381, 383-384 [because\nPAGA was \u201cestablished for a public reason,\u201d it \u201ccannot be contravened by a private\nagreement\u201d; an employer may not impose arbitration terms that would \u201cfrustrate PAGA\u2019s\nobjectives\u201d].) Under \u201cIskanian\u2019s . . . public policy rationale,\u201d an arbitration provision is\nunenforceable if it \u201ccircumvents [PAGA\u2019s] intent to empower employees to enforce the\nLabor Code as agency representatives and harms the state\u2019s interest in enforcing the\nLabor Code.\u201d (Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. v. Superior Court (2015) 234\nCal.App.4th 1109, 184.) In this cause, U-Haul is, in effect, attempting to impose its\npreferred forum for different aspects of the PAGA claim by requiring plaintiffs to\nindividually arbitrate whether a Labor Code violation was committed against them, while\nsimultaneously preserving its right to a judicial forum for the \u201crepresentative\u201d issues.3\n\n\n3       In Concepcion, supra, 566 U.S. 333, which involved the validity of consumer\nclass action waivers, the United States Supreme Court observed that while defendants\ngenerally favor arbitration for \u201cindividual disputes,\u201d they are unwilling to participate in\narbitration on a classwide basis: \u201c[A]lthough [t]he absence of multilayered review [in\narbitration] makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected[,] [d]efendants are\nwilling to accept the costs of these errors in [individual] arbitration, since their impact is\nlimited to the size of individual disputes, and presumably outweighed by savings from\navoiding the courts. But when damages allegedly owed to tens of thousands of potential\nclaimants are aggregated and decided at once, the risk of an error will often become\nunacceptable. Faced with even a small chance of a devastating loss, defendants will be\n\n                                              13\n\fWe think it clear that a private agreement requiring an employee to litigate his or her\nPAGA claim in multiple forums that have been selected based solely on the employer\u2019s\nown preferences interferes with \u201cthe state\u2019s interests in enforcing the Labor Code,\u201d and is\ntherefore against public policy. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 381.)\n       For the purposes of this case, we need not determine whether PAGA claims are\ncategorically exempted from private arbitration agreements. We conclude only that\nCalifornia law precludes an employer from requiring an employee to individually\narbitrate whether he or she qualifies as an \u201caggrieved employee\u201d within the meaning of\nPAGA, while simultaneously preserving its right to a judicial forum for all other aspects\nof the claim.\n\n          3. The FAA does not preempt state law rules applicable to PAGA claims\n       In its appellate briefing, U-Haul repeatedly argues that: (1) the FAA requires that\nall \u201c[a]rbitrable issues within a claim . . . be compelled to arbitration\u201d; and (2) because\nthe parties\u2019 employment agreement is governed by the FAA, federal law requires\narbitration of the \u201cpredicate issue of whether U-Haul committee Labor Code violations\nagainst [plaintiffs].\u201d To the extent U-Haul is suggesting the FAA preempts any state law\nrule that precludes an employer from forcing its employees to individually arbitrate their\nstatus as an \u201caggrieved employee,\u201d that argument is foreclosed by Iskanian, which held\nthat \u201ca PAGA claim lies outside the FAA\u2019s coverage.\u201d (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\np. 386.) Because the FAA does not apply to \u201cclaims belonging to a government agency\n[or] . . . claim[s] brought by a statutorily designated proxy for the agency\u201d (id. at p. 388),\nit has no effect on the issues presented herein.\n\n\n\n\npressured into settling questionable claims.\u201d (Id. at p. 350.) U-Haul\u2019s preference for\narbitration of the individual aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, but not the representative aspects,\nappears to be motivated by similar interests and concerns.\n\n                                              14\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n      The trial court\u2019s order denying the motion to compel arbitration is affirmed.\nRespondents shall recover their costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   ZELON, J.

Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2698 et seq.), alleging\nthat U-Haul Company of California (U-Haul) violated several provisions of the Labor\nCode, including overtime and meal break requirements. U-Haul filed a motion to compel\nplaintiffs to individually arbitrate whether they qualified as \u201caggrieved employee[s],\u201d\nand therefore had standing to pursue a PAGA claim. (See Labor Code, \u00a7 2699, subd.\n(a).) U-Haul asserted that all other issues regarding the PAGA claim should be stayed\npending resolution of the arbitration. The trial court denied the motion, concluding that\nCalifornia law prohibits an employer from compelling an employee to split the litigation\nof a PAGA claim between multiple forums. We affirm.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       A. Events Preceding the Motion to Compel Arbitration\n       In 2010 and 2011, U-Haul hired plaintiffs Erick Veliz and Sergio Perez\n(collectively plaintiffs) to serve as customer service representatives. As a condition of\ntheir employment, plaintiffs signed a mandatory arbitration agreement that contained the\nfollowing language: \u201cI agree that it is my obligation to . . . submit to final and binding\narbitration any and all claims and disputes . . . that are related in any way to my\nemployment . . . . [B]y agreeing to use arbitration to resolve my dispute, both U-Haul and\nI agree to . . . forego any right to bring claims as a representative or as a member of a\nclass or in a private attorney general capacity. . . .\u201d A separate provision stated that the\nagreement was \u201cgoverned by the Federal Arbitration Act [FAA], 9 U.S.C. et seq.\u201d\n       In 2012, plaintiffs each filed a class action complaint against U-Haul for\nvarious Labor Code violations including (among other things) unpaid overtime (Labor\nCode, \u00a7\u00a7 510, 1194 and 11981), failure to provide meal breaks (\u00a7226.7), failure to pay\nminimum wages (\u00a7\u00a7 1194, 1194.2, 1197, 1197.1), failure to pay wages in a timely\nmanner (\u00a7 204) and failure to provide accurate wage statements (\u00a7 226, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n1      Unless otherwise noted, all further statutory citations are to the Labor Code.\n\n                                              2\n\fVeliz\u2019s complaint additionally alleged a representative PAGA action seeking to collect\npenalties \u201con behalf of all other . . . [a]ggrieved [e]mployees.\u201d\n       The trial court granted a petition to coordinate the actions, and stayed the matter\npending the California Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Iskanian v. CLS Transportation Los\nAngeles, LLC (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iskanian). After Iskanian was decided, the\nplaintiffs each filed an amended complaint that alleged a single cause of action under\nPAGA seeking to collect penalties on behalf of themselves and other \u201caggrieved\nemployees\u201d for various Labor Code violations.\n\n       B. U-Haul\u2019s Motion to Compel Plaintiffs to Arbitrate Whether they Are\n          \u201cAggrieved Employees\u201d Within the Meaning of PAGA\n\n       On September 22, 2014, U-Haul filed motions seeking to compel plaintiffs to\nindividually arbitrate the \u201cpredicate issue of whether\u201d they had personally been subjected\nto any Labor Code violation, and therefore had standing to assert a PAGA claim. As\nstated in U-Haul\u2019s motions: \u201cStanding under PAGA requires that the plaintiff be an\n\u2018aggrieved employee\u2019 in order to bring a claim for statutory penalties on behalf of himself\nand other employees. [Citation] The Labor Code defines \u2018aggrieved employee\u2019 as \u2018any\nperson who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the\nallege violations was committed.\u2019 [Citation] [\u00b6] Whether plaintiff is an \u2018aggrieved\nemployee\u2019 will require a determination of whether U-Haul committed Labor Code\nviolations against him, specifically, whether U-Haul was allegedly in violation of\nCalifornia Labor Codes.\u201d U-Haul further asserted that the \u201crepresentative portion\u201d of the\nPAGA claims, which included \u201cthe number, scope and identities of other \u2018aggrieved\nemployees\u2019 . . . . and the amount of representative penalties,\u201d were \u201cnon-arbitrable\u201d under\nthe employment agreement, and should be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration.\n       Plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing that the California Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in Iskanian made clear that \u201cclaims brought pursuant to PAGA are not arbitrable\nin any manner whatsoever, as it is against public policy.\u201d Plaintiffs further contended\nthat if every employee could be compelled to arbitrate \u201cwhether [he or she had] suffered\n\n\n                                              3\n\fthe underlying Labor Code violations to establish that [he or she is an] aggrieved\nemployee,\u201d Iskanian would be rendered \u201cmeaningless as . . . then this argument could be\napplied to . . . require every [employee] to first arbitrate whether they are a true\n\u2018aggrieved employee.\u2019\u201d\n       In reply, U-Haul argued that Iskanian did \u201cnot hold that part of a PAGA claim\ncannot be arbitrated or that the predicate issue of whether U-Haul committed Labor Code\nviolations against [plaintiff] cannot be arbitrated. Instead, Iskanian requires [only] that\n\u2018aggrieved employees\u2019 be allowed to bring representative PAGA actions.\u201d U-haul further\ncontended that the employment agreement was governed by the FAA, which explicitly\n\u201cauthorizes the severance of arbitrable issues from non-arbitrable issues.\u201d U-Haul argued\nthat several federal decisions applying the FAA had held that when a single claim raises\n\u201c\u2018both arbitrable issues and nonarbitrable issues,\u2019\u201d the court must \u201csever[] the arbitrable\nissues.\u201d According to U-Haul, because plaintiffs\u2019 status as \u201caggrieved employee[s]\u201d was\nan \u201carbitrable issue\u201d under the employment agreement, the FAA required that the issue to\nbe severed from the remaining \u201crepresentative\u201d issues of the PAGA claim.\nAfter a hearing, the court entered an order concluding there was no legal basis to compel\narbitration \u201cof the predicate issue of whether U-Haul committed Labor Code violations\nagainst Plaintiffs.\u201d The court explained that Iskanian had \u201cspoken on this issue and\ndetermined that the FAA does not apply to PAGA . . . [\u00b6] Contrary to defendant\u2019s\narguments . . ., the Iskanian Court was unequivocal in finding that a PAGA claim is not\nsubject to the [FAA]. That is the dispute is, in fact, between the State and the employer.\nThus, the federal cases [regarding severance] cited by Defendant, which all rely on the\nFAA, are distinguishable.\u201d The trial court further explained that other California\ndecisions had held that PAGA claims can only be brought in a representative capacity,\nand \u201cnot [as] an individual [claim]. . . . As such, there is no basis for individuals to\narbitrate whether they are individual \u2018aggrieved employees\u2019 before proceeding to [a trial\non the remainder of the PAGA claim]. [B]ecause the [plaintiffs\u2019] PAGA claim is (1)\noutside the FAA, and (2) not an individual claim, there is no basis to compel arbitration\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fto first determine whether the representative plaintiffs are \u2018aggrieved employees\u2019 under\nPAGA.\u201d\n                                      DISCUSSION\n       A. Standard of Review and Summary of the Issue on Appeal\n       An order denying a petition to compel arbitration is appealable. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n\u00a7 1294, subd. (a).) \u201cIn general, \u2018[t]here is no uniform standard of review for evaluating an\norder denying a [petition] to compel arbitration. [Citation.] If the court\u2019s order is based\non a decision of fact, then we adopt a substantial evidence standard. [Citations.]\nAlternatively, if the court\u2019s denial rests solely on a decision of law, then a de novo\nstandard of review is employed. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Laswell v. AG Seal Beach,\nLLC (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1399</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1406.)\n       The parties do not dispute that: (1) the parties entered into a valid, enforceable\narbitration agreement that is governed by the FAA; (2) the agreement\u2019s provision\nprecluding employees from asserting a representative PAGA claim is unenforceable as a\nmatter of California law (see Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 384); and (3) the parties did\nnot contemplate arbitrating a representative PAGA action, meaning that the\nrepresentative claim must proceed in court. They disagree, however, whether the\nagreement nonetheless requires plaintiffs to individually arbitrate whether they qualify as\n\u201caggrieved employee[s],\u201d and therefore have standing to bring a representative PAGA\naction on behalf of \u201cother current or former employees.\u201d (See \u00a7 2699, subd. (a).)2 For\nthe purposes of PAGA, an \u201caggrieved employee\u201d is defined to \u201cmean[] any person who\nwas employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the alleged\n[Labor Code] violations was committed.\u201d (\u00a7 2699, subd. (c).)\n\n\n\n2      Section 2699, subdivision (a) states, in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other\nprovision of law, any provision of this code that provides for a civil penalty to be\nassessed and collected by the Labor and Workforce Development Agency . . . , for a\nviolation of this code, may, as an alternative, be recovered through a civil action brought\nby an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former\nemployees pursuant to the procedures specified in Section 2699.3.\u201d\n\n                                              5\n\f       Plaintiffs contend the analysis and reasoning in Iskanian makes clear that\nemployers are not permitted to compel employees to arbitrate any aspect of a PAGA\nclaim, including the question whether they qualify as aggrieved employees. U-Haul\ndisagrees, arguing that Iskanian merely held that PAGA waivers in arbitration\nagreements are unenforceable as a matter of state law, and that the FAA does not preempt\nthis rule. U-Haul further contends that, in this case, it is not seeking to preclude plaintiffs\nfrom pursuing a representative PAGA claim, but rather is seeking only to arbitrate the\nplaintiffs\u2019 individual standing to bring a PAGA claim. If the arbitrator determines the\nplaintiffs are aggrieved employees within the meaning of PAGA, they may then proceed\nwith their representative action in the superior court.\n\n       B. Summary of Iskanian v. CLS Transportation\n\n       The issues in this appeal turn largely on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in\nIskanian, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The plaintiff in Iskanian filed a class action against his\nemployer for unpaid overtime and various other Labor Code violations. The complaint\nalso alleged a representative claim under the PAGA seeking penalties on behalf of all\naggrieved employees. The employer moved to compel individual arbitration of each\nclaim, contending that plaintiff had signed an employment agreement that contained a\nwaiver of his right to pursue class or representative claims.\n       While the motion was pending, the California Supreme Court issued Gentry v.\nSuperior Court (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2518818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2518818/gentry-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which held that \u201cclass action waivers in\nemployment arbitration agreements are invalid under certain circumstances.\u201d (Iskanian,\nsupra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 361.) The employer subsequently withdrew its motion to compel\narbitration, and the parties proceeded to litigate the case. After the plaintiff had obtained\na class certification order, the United States Supreme Court issued AT & T Mobility LLC\nv. Concepcion (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Concepcion ), which invalidated a prior California\nSupreme Court decision that \u201crestricted consumer class action waivers in arbitration\nagreements.\u201d (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 361 [discussing Discover Bank v.\nSuperior Court (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2570216\"><a href=\"/opinion/2570216/discover-bank-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">].) The employer then renewed its motion to\n\n\n                                               6\n\fcompel individual arbitration, arguing that Concepcion had invalidated Gentry\u2019s state law\nrule precluding the enforcement of class action waivers. The trial court granted the\nmotion, ordered the case into individual arbitration and dismissed the class and\nrepresentative claims. The Court of Appeal affirmed.\n       The California Supreme Court agreed that the principles set forth in Concepcion\nmade clear that the FAA preempted Gentry\u2019s state law rule precluding the enforcement of\nclass arbitration waivers in employment agreements. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\np. 362.) The Court explained that Concepcion had two central holdings: (1) the FAA\npreempts state rules that are incompatible with the fundamental attributes of arbitration;\nand (2) classwide arbitration interferes with numerous attributes of arbitration, including\nits expediency and informality. The Court concluded that in light of these holdings, the\n\u201cGentry rule\u201d was no longer valid. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 366.)\n       The Court next considered whether state law prohibited the enforcement of\nrepresentative PAGA claim waivers in employment agreements, and, if so, whether the\nFAA preempted application of such a prohibition. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\npp. 361.) The court began its analysis by summarizing the purpose and structure of\nPAGA: \u201cThe Legislature declared that adequate financing of labor law enforcement was\nnecessary to achieve maximum compliance with state labor laws, that staffing levels for\nlabor law enforcement agencies had declined and were unlikely to keep pace with the\nfuture growth of the labor market, and that it was therefore in the public interest to allow\naggrieved employees, acting as private attorneys general, to recover civil penalties for\nLabor Code violations, with the understanding that labor law enforcement agencies were\nto retain primacy over private enforcement efforts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Id. at p. 379.) To\nachieve those goals, PAGA authorizes \u201can \u2018aggrieved employee\u2019 [to] bring a civil action\npersonally and on behalf of other current or former employees to recover civil penalties\nfor Labor Code violations. [Citation.] Of the civil penalties recovered, 75 percent goes\nto the Labor and Workforce Development Agency, leaving the remaining 25 percent for\nthe \u201caggrieved employees.\u201d [Citations.] [\u00b6] Before bringing a civil action for statutory\npenalties, an employee must . . . give written notice of the alleged Labor Code violation\n\n                                              7\n\fto both the employer and the Labor and Workforce Development Agency. . . . If the\nagency does not intend to investigate . . . , the employee may commence a civil action.\n[Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Id. at p. 380.)\n       The Court explained that the purpose and structure of the PAGA statute\ndemonstrated that \u201c\u2018[a]n employee plaintiff suing . . . under the [statute] does so as the\nproxy or agent of the state\u2019s labor law enforcement agencies . . . . In a lawsuit brought\nunder the act, the employee plaintiff represents the same legal right and interest as state\nlabor law enforcement agencies\u2014namely, recovery of civil penalties that otherwise\nwould have been assessed and collected by the Labor Workforce Development Agency.\n[Citations.] . . . . [\u00b6] . . . . [Thus, a]n action to recover civil penalties \u2018is fundamentally a\nlaw enforcement action designed to protect the public and not to benefit private parties\u2019\n[Citation.] . . . .[\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . . The government entity on whose behalf the plaintiff files\nsuit is always the real party in interest in the suit.\u201d (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\npp. 380-382)\n       The Court concluded that in light of these \u201clegal characteristics\u201d (Iskanian, supra,\n59 Cal.4th at p. 380), \u201can employee\u2019s right to bring a PAGA action is unwaivable.\u201d\nHence, an employer cannot compel an employee to waive his right to bring a\nrepresentative PAGA claim through an agreement. The Court reasoned that because \u201cthe\nLegislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the PAGA was to augment the limited enforcement\ncapability of the Labor and Workforce Development Agency by empowering employees\nto enforce the Labor Code as representatives of the Agency,\u201d a PAGA waiver \u201cserve[d]\nto disable one of the primary mechanisms for enforcing the Labor Code. . . . [\u00b6]. . . . The\nPAGA was clearly established for a public reason, and agreements requiring the waiver\nof PAGA rights would harm the state\u2019s interests in enforcing the Labor Code and in\nreceiving the proceeds of civil penalties used to deter violations.\u201d (Id. at p. 383.)\n       The Court further explained that the representative waiver at issue was against\npublic policy even though the plaintiff retained his right to arbitrate a single-claimant\nPAGA claim on behalf of himself and the state: \u201c[A] prohibition of representative\nclaims frustrates the PAGA\u2019s objectives . . . [because] a single-claimant arbitration . . .\n\n                                                 8\n\ffor individual penalties will not result in the penalties contemplated under the PAGA to\npunish and deter employer practices that violate the rights of numerous employees under\nthe Labor Code. That plaintiff and other employees might be able to bring individual\nclaims for Labor Code violations in separate arbitrations does not serve the purpose of the\nPAGA, even if an individual claim has collateral estoppel effects. [Citation.] Other\nemployees would still have to assert their claims in individual proceedings.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d\n(Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at pp. 383-384.)\n       Finally, the Court considered whether the FAA preempted this rule of California\nlaw, concluding that it did not: \u201cConcepcion made clear [that] a state law rule may be\npreempted when it \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA\u2019s\nobjectives.\u2019 [Citation.] . . . [T]he rule against PAGA waivers does not frustrate the\nFAA\u2019s objectives because . . . the FAA aims to ensure an efficient forum for the\nresolution of private disputes, whereas a PAGA action is a dispute between an employer\nand the state Agency. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Simply put, a PAGA claim lies outside the FAA\u2019s\ncoverage because it is not a dispute between an employer and an employee arising out of\ntheir contractual relationship. It is a dispute between an employer and the state, which\nalleges directly or through its agents\u2014either the Labor and Workforce Development\nAgency or aggrieved employees\u2014that the employer has violated the Labor Code. . . .\u201d\n(Id. at pp. 384-387.)\n\n       C. The Trial Court Correctly Concluded Plaintiffs Are Not Required to\n          Individually Arbitrate Whether they Qualify as \u201cAggrieved Employees\u201d\n\n       Like the arbitration agreement at issue in Iskanian, U-Haul\u2019s employment\nagreement contains language stating that: (1) the employee must arbitrate \u201cany and all\nclaims and disputes . . . that are in any way related to [his or her] employment\u201d; and (2)\nboth parties \u201cshall forego any right to bring claims as a representative or as a member of\na class or in a private attorney general capacity.\u201d U-Haul concedes that under Iskanian,\nthe PAGA waiver is not enforceable, and that plaintiffs are therefore permitted to proceed\nwith their PAGA action in court.\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       U-Haul contends, however, that the plaintiffs may nonetheless be compelled to\nindividually arbitrate the \u201cpredicate issue of whether\u201d they are \u201caggrieved employee[s]\nwithin the meaning of PAGA, and thus have standing to bring . . . representative\nclaim[s].\u201d According to U-Haul, if the arbitrator determines it did \u201ccommit[] Labor Code\nviolations against [plaintiffs]\u201d (thereby establishing standing), plaintiffs may then pursue\ntheir \u201crepresentative PAGA claim [in court], e.g., . . . the number, scope and identities of\nother \u2018aggrieved employees\u2019 that [plaintiffs] will represent, and the amount of\nrepresentative penalties.\u201d Stated more simply, U-Haul argues that although \u201cneither\n[party] agreed to arbitrate representative issues, and neither may be compelled to\nparticipate in a representative arbitration,\u201d plaintiffs may be compelled to individually\narbitrate whether they have standing to bring such a representative claim.\n\n           1. Whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue a PAGA claim is not an issue\n              that falls within the scope of the arbitration agreement\n\n       Preliminarily, we address whether the particular issue U-Haul seeks to\narbitrate\u2015plaintiffs\u2019 status as \u201caggrieved employees\u201d with standing to bring a PAGA\nclaim\u2015actually falls within the scope of the parties\u2019 employment agreement. \u201cThe scope\nof arbitration is a matter of agreement between the parties. [Citations.] A party can be\ncompelled to arbitrate only those issues it has agreed to arbitrate.

The agreement, however, contains an additional clause stating\nthat the parties would not seek arbitration (or litigation) of any \u201cclaims as a representative\n. . . or in a private attorney general capacity.\u201d U-Haul acknowledges that this language\ndemonstrates neither party agreed (nor could be compelled) to arbitrate representative\nclaims. Iskanian, in turn, held that every PAGA action, including one brought on behalf\nof a single employee, is a representative claim. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 387\n[\u201cevery PAGA action, whether seeking penalties for Labor Code violations as to only one\naggrieved employee\u2014the plaintiff bringing the action\u2014or as to other employees as well,\nis a representative action on behalf of the state\u201d] [emphasis in original].) Given that the\nparties did not agree to arbitrate representative claims, and that a PAGA action is by\ndefinition a form of representative claim, we conclude that PAGA claims are\ncategorically excluded from the arbitration agreement. Moreover, the agreement contains\nno language suggesting that despite this exclusion of representative claims, the parties did\nagree to arbitrate whether the complaining party had standing to initiate a representative\nclaim in court. We fail to see how an agreement that excludes representative claims can\nnonetheless be reasonably interpreted to require plaintiffs to arbitrate their standing to\nbring a representative claim.\n\n          2. Even if the agreement does require plaintiffs to arbitrate whether they have\n             standing to bring a PAGA claim, the provision is unenforceable under\n             California law\n\n       Even if we were to accept U-Haul\u2019s interpretation of the employment agreement,\nwe are not aware of any authority supporting its argument that an employer may legally\ncompel an employee to arbitrate the individual aspects of his or her PAGA claim, while\nsimultaneously preserving its own right to litigate the representative aspects of the claim\nin court. The only decision that has addressed the issue, Williams v. Superior Court\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Williams), held that an employer could not force employees\nto proceed in such a manner. As in this case, the plaintiff in Williams signed an\n\n                                             11\n\farbitration agreement that contained a waiver of his right to assert a representative claim.\nThe plaintiff subsequently a filed \u201ca single-count [PAGA] action\u201d alleging that his\nemployer had \u201cfailed to provide off-duty rest periods, as required by section 226.7.\u201d\n(Id. at pp. 644-645.) The employer \u201cmoved . . . for an order staying the PAGA claim, but\nsending the \u2018individual claim\u2019 that [plaintiff] had been subjected to Labor Code violations\nto arbitration.\u201d (Id. at p. 645.) The trial court granted the motion, explaining that while\nIskanian precluded the employer from \u201cforc[ing] [plaintiff] to waive or arbitrate his\nPAGA claim[,] . . . the \u2018threshold dispute between plaintiff . . . and his former employer\nas to whether or not he was denied off-duty rest periods\u2019 [was] . . . \u2018amenable to\narbitration under Iskanian.\u2019\u201d (Id. at p. 646.)\n       The appellate court reversed, concluding there was no basis for the trial court\u2019s\n\u201cdetermin[ation] that [the plaintiff] must submit the \u2018underlying controversy\u2019 to\narbitration for a determination whether he is an \u2018aggrieved employee\u2019 under the Labor\nCode with standing to bring a representative PAGA claim. [Citation.]\u201d (Williams, supra,\n237 Cal.App.4th at p. 647.) The court noted that neither the employer nor the trial court\nhad \u201ccited [any] legal authority . . . that a single representative action may be split in such\na manner. . . . Indeed, case law suggests that a single representative PAGA claim cannot\nbe split into an arbitrable individual claim and a nonarbitrable representative claim\nbrought solely on the employee\u2019s behalf [because every] . . . . PAGA claim [is\nbrought] . . . \u2018as the proxy or agent of the state\u2019s labor law enforcement agencies.\u201d\n[Citation.]\u2019 Accordingly, petitioner cannot be compelled to submit any portion of his\nrepresentative PAGA claim to arbitration, including whether he was an \u2018aggrieved\nemployee.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Id. at p. 649 [emphasis in original].)\n       We agree with Williams\u2019s conclusion that California law prohibits the enforcement\nof an employment agreement provision that requires an employee to individually arbitrate\nwhether he or she qualifies as an \u201caggrieved employee\u201d under PAGA, and then (if\nsuccessful) to litigate the remainder of the \u201crepresentative action in the superior court.\u201d\nIn Iskanian, the Supreme Court explained that \u201cevery PAGA action, whether seeking\npenalties for Labor Code violations as to only one aggrieved employee\u2015the plaintiff\n\n                                              12\n\fbringing the action\u2014or as to other employees as well, is a representative action on\nbehalf of the state.\u201d (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 387.) The Court also held that\nrequiring an employee to bring a PAGA claim in his or her \u201cindividual\u201d capacity, rather\nthan in a \u201crepresentative\u201d capacity, would undermine the purposes of the statute. (Id. at\npp. 383-384.) Given these conclusions, we do not believe an employer may force an\nemployee to split a PAGA claim into \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201crepresentative\u201d components, with\neach being litigated in a different forum.\n       Moreover, the reasoning of Iskanian indicates that an employer is not permitted to\nimpose arbitration provisions that impede an aggrieved employee\u2019s ability to bring a\nPAGA claim, which is \u201c\u2018fundamentally a law enforcement action designed to protect the\npublic. . . . \u2019 [Citation].\u201d (See Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at pp. 381, 383-384 [because\nPAGA was \u201cestablished for a public reason,\u201d it \u201ccannot be contravened by a private\nagreement\u201d; an employer may not impose arbitration terms that would \u201cfrustrate PAGA\u2019s\nobjectives\u201d].) Under \u201cIskanian\u2019s . . . public policy rationale,\u201d an arbitration provision is\nunenforceable if it \u201ccircumvents [PAGA\u2019s] intent to empower employees to enforce the\nLabor Code as agency representatives and harms the state\u2019s interest in enforcing the\nLabor Code.\u201d (Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. v. Superior Court (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In this cause, U-Haul is, in effect, attempting to impose its\npreferred forum for different aspects of the PAGA claim by requiring plaintiffs to\nindividually arbitrate whether a Labor Code violation was committed against them, while\nsimultaneously preserving its right to a judicial forum for the \u201crepresentative\u201d issues.3\n\n\n3       In Concepcion, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which involved the validity of consumer\nclass action waivers, the United States Supreme Court observed that while defendants\ngenerally favor arbitration for \u201cindividual disputes,\u201d they are unwilling to participate in\narbitration on a classwide basis: \u201c[A]lthough [t]he absence of multilayered review [in\narbitration] makes it more likely that errors will go uncorrected[,] [d]efendants are\nwilling to accept the costs of these errors in [individual] arbitration, since their impact is\nlimited to the size of individual disputes, and presumably outweighed by savings from\navoiding the courts. But when damages allegedly owed to tens of thousands of potential\nclaimants are aggregated and decided at once, the risk of an error will often become\nunacceptable. Faced with even a small chance of a devastating loss, defendants will be\n\n                                              13\n\fWe think it clear that a private agreement requiring an employee to litigate his or her\nPAGA claim in multiple forums that have been selected based solely on the employer\u2019s\nown preferences interferes with \u201cthe state\u2019s interests in enforcing the Labor Code,\u201d and is\ntherefore against public policy. (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at p. 381.)\n       For the purposes of this case, we need not determine whether PAGA claims are\ncategorically exempted from private arbitration agreements. We conclude only that\nCalifornia law precludes an employer from requiring an employee to individually\narbitrate whether he or she qualifies as an \u201caggrieved employee\u201d within the meaning of\nPAGA, while simultaneously preserving its right to a judicial forum for all other aspects\nof the claim.\n\n          3. The FAA does not preempt state law rules applicable to PAGA claims\n       In its appellate briefing, U-Haul repeatedly argues that: (1) the FAA requires that\nall \u201c[a]rbitrable issues within a claim . . . be compelled to arbitration\u201d; and (2) because\nthe parties\u2019 employment agreement is governed by the FAA, federal law requires\narbitration of the \u201cpredicate issue of whether U-Haul committee Labor Code violations\nagainst [plaintiffs].\u201d To the extent U-Haul is suggesting the FAA preempts any state law\nrule that precludes an employer from forcing its employees to individually arbitrate their\nstatus as an \u201caggrieved employee,\u201d that argument is foreclosed by Iskanian, which held\nthat \u201ca PAGA claim lies outside the FAA\u2019s coverage.\u201d (Iskanian, supra, 59 Cal.4th at\np. 386.) Because the FAA does not apply to \u201cclaims belonging to a government agency\n[or] . . . claim[s] brought by a statutorily designated proxy for the agency\u201d (id. at p. 388),\nit has no effect on the issues presented herein.\n\n\n\n\npressured into settling questionable claims.\u201d (Id. at p. 350.) U-Haul\u2019s preference for\narbitration of the individual aspects of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, but not the representative aspects,\nappears to be motivated by similar interests and concerns.\n\n                                              14\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n      The trial court\u2019s order denying the motion to compel arbitration is affirmed.\nRespondents shall recover their costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   ZELON, J.
