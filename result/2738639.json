Spencer, attempts to appeal from the trial court\u2019s order\n\ngranting the motion to dismiss filed by appellees, Joe Pagliarulo and CC Media\n\nHoldings, Inc., pursuant to section 27.003 of the Texas Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code. We dismiss the appeal.\n\f      An appeal from an \u201corder on a motion to dismiss a legal action under\n\nSection 27.003\u201d of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code is an accelerated\n\nappeal. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 27.008(b) (West Supp. 2014)\n\n(requiring appellate court to expedite appeal from order on motion filed pursuant to\n\nsection 27.003); TEX. R. APP. P. 28.1(a) (defining accelerated appeal to include\n\nappeals required by statute to be expedited). In an accelerated appeal, absent a\n\nmotion to extend time under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 26.3, \u201cthe\n\ndeadline for filing a notice of appeal is strictly set at twenty days after the\n\njudgment is signed, with no exceptions . . . .\u201d In re K.A.F., 160 S.W.3d 923, 927\n\n(Tex. 2005); see TEX. R. APP. P. 26.1(b). If a motion for extension of time to file\n\nthe notice of appeal is timely filed, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal is\n\nextended by fifteen days, to thirty-five days after the judgment is signed. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 26.3; Verburgt v. Dorner, 959 S.W.2d 615, 617 (Tex. 1997). Filing a\n\nmotion for new trial does not extend the appellate deadlines in an accelerated\n\nappeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 28.1(b); K.A.F., 160 S.W.3d at 927, 928; In re R.B.M.,\n\n338 S.W.3d 755, 756 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.).\n\n      Because the trial court granted the appellees\u2019 section 27.003 motion to\n\ndismiss on March 3, 2014 and issued its final judgment on March 25, 2014,\n\nSpencer\u2019s notice of appeal was due by April 14, 2014. Spencer, proceeding pro se,\n\nfiled his notice of appeal on May 2, 2014, which was thirty-eight days after the\n\n\n                                         2\n\ffinal judgment was rendered.     Hence, Spencer\u2019s notice of appeal was untimely.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 26.1(b), 26.3; K.A.F., 160 S.W.3d at 927.\n\n      On September 2, 2014, we notified Spencer that his appeal was subject to\n\ndismissal for want of jurisdiction unless he filed a written response showing how\n\nthis Court has jurisdiction over this appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 42.3(a) (allowing\n\ninvoluntary dismissal of case after notice). Although Spencer did not respond to\n\nour September 2, 2014 notice, he had previously filed a response to a notice issued\n\nby the Clerk on August 20, 2014, in which he contended that he had sixty days to\n\nappeal the trial court\u2019s ruling under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nsection 27.008. This argument appears to rely on former section 27.008(c), which\n\nwas repealed effective June 14, 2013 and is therefore inapplicable to this case. See\n\nAct of May 21, 2011, 82d Leg., R.S., ch. 341, \u00a7 2, sec. 27.008(c), 2011 Tex. Gen.\n\nLaws 961, 963, repealed by Act of May 24, 2013, 83d Leg., R.S., ch. 1042, \u00a7 5,\n\n2013 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. 2501, 2502 (West).\n\n      Because Spencer\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed within twenty days of the\n\ntrial court\u2019s final judgment or within the fifteen-day extension period, Spencer\u2019s\n\nresponse fails to demonstrate either that his notice of appeal was timely or that we\n\nhave jurisdiction over this appeal. See TEX. R. APP. P. 2 (prohibiting appellate\n\ncourt from construing Rule 2 to \u201calter the time for perfecting an appeal in a civil\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fcase\u201d), 26.3 (authorizing extension of time if motion for extension is filed within\n\nfifteen days of deadline); K.A.F., 160 S.W.3d at 927.\n\n      Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.
