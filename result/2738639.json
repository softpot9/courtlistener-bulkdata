See TEX. R. APP. P. 42.3(a) (allowing\n\ninvoluntary dismissal of case after notice). Although Spencer did not respond to\n\nour September 2, 2014 notice, he had previously filed a response to a notice issued\n\nby the Clerk on August 20, 2014, in which he contended that he had sixty days to\n\nappeal the trial court\u2019s ruling under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\nsection 27.008. This argument appears to rely on former section 27.008(c), which\n\nwas repealed effective June 14, 2013 and is therefore inapplicable to this case.
