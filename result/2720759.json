Mitchell (Movant) appeals the motion court\u201fs denial, without an\n\nevidentiary hearing, of his Rule 24.035 amended motion for post-conviction relief.     In\n\nhis sole point relied on, Movant contends that the motion court erred by denying his\n\nmotion without an evidentiary hearing because counsel pressured him into entering his\n\nguilty plea, thereby rendering his plea involuntary, and that, but for counsel\u201fs deficient\n\nperformance, Movant would not have pleaded guilty but would have proceeded to trial.\n\nWe affirm.\n\f                                             Factual Background\n\n           In December 2003, Movant had deviate sexual intercourse with an eight-year-old\n\nvictim. Once the victim disclosed the abuse, police contacted Movant and Movant, after\n\nreceiving his Miranda1 rights, confessed to the sexual contact. Movant was indicted in\n\nApril 2010 and, in May 2011, Movant entered a blind plea of guilty to first-degree\n\nstatutory sodomy.2 The circuit court accepted the plea and, at a later hearing, sentenced\n\nMovant to 15 years\u201f imprisonment in the Department of Corrections.\n\n           In August 2011, Movant filed a pro se Rule 24.035 motion seeking post-\n\nconviction relief. Subsequently, appointed counsel filed an amended motion alleging that\n\ndefense counsel\u201fs performance was \u201cineffective for pressuring [Movant] to enter a plea of\n\nguilty even though [Movant] wanted to proceed to trial to prove his innocence\u201d and that\n\n\u201c[b]ut for counsel\u201fs ineffectiveness, [Movant] would not have entered a plea of guilty,\n\nbut would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d The motion court denied the motion without\n\nan evidentiary hearing, finding that \u201cthe record clearly refutes Movant\u201fs claim that he\n\nwas pressured into pleading guilty . . . .\u201d This appeal followed.\n\n                                             Standard of Review\n\n           We review the denial of a Rule 24.035 post-conviction motion to determine\n\nwhether the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the motion court are clearly\n\nerroneous.

Movant\n\nmaintains that counsel\u201fs performance rendered his guilty plea involuntary, unknowing,\n\nand unintelligent and, but for counsel\u201fs advice, Movant would not have pleaded guilty\n\nand would have proceeded to trial.

Smith, 353 S.W.3d at 3.\n\n       Further, a movant is not entitled to a post-conviction evidentiary hearing on an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim if the guilty plea proceedings directly refute the\n\nmovant\u201fs claims that the plea was involuntary.

App. E.D. 2010). \u201cTo justify the denial of an evidentiary hearing on an ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim, the record must be \u201especific enough to refute conclusively\n\nthe movant\u201fs allegation.\u201f\u201d Nichols, 409 S.W.3d at 569 (citation omitted). \u201c[A] motion\n\ncourt properly denies an evidentiary hearing on a motion for post-conviction relief where\n\nthe movant repeatedly assured the plea court that he was satisfied with counsel\u201fs\n\nrepresentation and that counsel did everything he requested and the movant was given\n\nample opportunity to express his duress to the court.\u201d Id. at 570 (citation and quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n       At the plea hearing, Movant indicated that defense counsel had \u201cadvised [Movant]\n\nas to all aspects of this case, including [Movant\u201fs] legal rights\u201d and that Movant had had\n\n\u201cenough time before deciding\u201d that he wanted to plead guilty. When asked whether he\n\nhad had \u201csufficient time\u201d to discuss the case with his attorney, Movant initially answered,\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d but then clarified that he had had enough time to \u201cjust now\u201d discuss the case\n\n\n                                            4\n\fwith his attorney. Movant also repeatedly confirmed that he understood that, by pleading\n\nguilty, he was waiving his rights to a jury trial, to be presumed innocent, and to present\n\nand confront witnesses. After the State announced the evidence against Movant, which\n\nMovant affirmed to be substantially true and correct, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n       THE COURT: Do you understand that the Court will not accept a plea of\n       guilty from anyone who claims to be innocent?\n\n       [MOVANT]: Yes, your honor.\n\n       THE COURT: Have any threats or promises been made to you to induce\n       you to plead guilty?\n\n       [MOVANT]: No, Your Honor.\n\nAfter Movant again admitted to the circuit court that he committed the offense, the circuit\n\ncourt asked defense counsel whether there was \u201cany reason why the Court should not\n\naccept [Movant\u201fs] plea of guilty?\u201d to which defense counsel responded, \u201cNo, Your\n\nHonor.\u201d When the circuit court asked Movant whether he had any questions, Movant\n\nresponded, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d The circuit court then accepted Movant\u201fs plea as \u201cfreely,\n\nvoluntarily and intelligently made with a full understanding of the charge and the\n\nconsequences of the plea . . . .\u201d\n\n       Two months later at the sentencing hearing, the circuit court asked Movant\n\nwhether he had anything to say before the court announced the sentence, to which\n\nMovant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d         Regarding counsel\u201fs performance, Movant testified as\n\nfollows:\n\n       THE COURT: Did you have sufficient time to discuss this case with your\n       attorney prior to entering your plea of guilty in this matter?\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      [MOVANT]: Yeah.\n\n      THE COURT: Did your attorney do the things that you asked him to do\n      prior to entering your plea of guilty?\n\n      [MOVANT]: Yes.\n\n                                     *     *      *\n\n      THE COURT: Other than the plea, did your attorney communicate any\n      threats or promises to you to induce you to enter your plea of guilty?\n\n      [MOVANT]: No.\n\n      THE COURT:        Are you satisfied with the services rendered by your\n      attorney?\n\n      [MOVANT]: Yes.\n\n      THE COURT: Is there anything you wish to add concerning the assistance\n      you received from your attorney?\n\n                                     *     *      *\n\n      [MOVANT]: No. He did good.\n\n      THE COURT: Is there anything that you wish me to consider concerning\n      your representation by your attorney before I determine whether or not\n      probable cause exists to believe that you received ineffective assistance of\n      counsel?\n\n      [MOVANT]: No. I\u201fm okay.\n\n\n      Movant\u201fs answers to the circuit court\u201fs questions at both the plea and sentencing\n\nhearings directly refute Movant\u201fs assertion that defense counsel pressured Movant to\n\nenter his plea of guilty. At the plea hearing and again at the sentencing hearing, Movant\n\nindicated that he had had sufficient time to discuss the case with defense counsel before\n\ndeciding to plead guilty. Movant also confirmed at both hearings that no threats or\n\n\n                                           6\n\fpromises had been made to induce him to enter his guilty plea, which directly refutes\n\nMovant\u201fs claim that his plea was the result of pressure from counsel. Moreover, the\n\ncircuit court gave Movant repeated opportunities at both the plea and sentencing hearings\n\nto inform the court that he had been pressured into pleading guilty. Movant, however,\n\nnever indicated that his plea was the result of coercion or \u201cpressure\u201d and instead\n\nunequivocally indicated that he was fully satisfied with counsel\u201fs performance.\n\n       Despite Movant\u201fs repeated assertions that he was satisfied with counsel\u201fs\n\nperformance and that his plea had not been induced by threats or promises, Movant\n\nasserts that the facts of the instant case warrant relief because the circuit court did not\n\nspecifically ask him whether he had been \u201cpressured\u201d into entering his plea. This fact\n\ndoes not nullify the abundant evidence on the record directly refuting Movant\u201fs claim\n\nthat his plea was involuntarily made. It is true that \u201c[a] negative response to a routine\n\ninquiry regarding whether any promises or threats had been made to induce a guilty plea\n\nis too general to encompass all possible statements by counsel to his client.\u201d Conger v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 222 (Mo.

To establish prejudice where a movant has pleaded\n\nguilty, the movant must show that but for counsel\u201fs errors, he would not have pleaded\n\nguilty and would instead have insisted on proceeding to trial. Smith, 353 S.W.3d at 3.\n\n       Further, a movant is not entitled to a post-conviction evidentiary hearing on an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim if the guilty plea proceedings directly refute the\n\nmovant\u201fs claims that the plea was involuntary. Wilder v. State, 301 S.W.3d 122, 127\n\n(Mo. App. E.D. 2010). \u201cTo justify the denial of an evidentiary hearing on an ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim, the record must be \u201especific enough to refute conclusively\n\nthe movant\u201fs allegation.\u201f\u201d Nichols, 409 S.W.3d at 569 (citation omitted). \u201c[A] motion\n\ncourt properly denies an evidentiary hearing on a motion for post-conviction relief where\n\nthe movant repeatedly assured the plea court that he was satisfied with counsel\u201fs\n\nrepresentation and that counsel did everything he requested and the movant was given\n\nample opportunity to express his duress to the court.\u201d Id. at 570 (citation and quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n       At the plea hearing, Movant indicated that defense counsel had \u201cadvised [Movant]\n\nas to all aspects of this case, including [Movant\u201fs] legal rights\u201d and that Movant had had\n\n\u201cenough time before deciding\u201d that he wanted to plead guilty. When asked whether he\n\nhad had \u201csufficient time\u201d to discuss the case with his attorney, Movant initially answered,\n\n\u201cNot really,\u201d but then clarified that he had had enough time to \u201cjust now\u201d discuss the case\n\n\n                                            4\n\fwith his attorney. Movant also repeatedly confirmed that he understood that, by pleading\n\nguilty, he was waiving his rights to a jury trial, to be presumed innocent, and to present\n\nand confront witnesses. After the State announced the evidence against Movant, which\n\nMovant affirmed to be substantially true and correct, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n       THE COURT: Do you understand that the Court will not accept a plea of\n       guilty from anyone who claims to be innocent?\n\n       [MOVANT]: Yes, your honor.\n\n       THE COURT: Have any threats or promises been made to you to induce\n       you to plead guilty?\n\n       [MOVANT]: No, Your Honor.\n\nAfter Movant again admitted to the circuit court that he committed the offense, the circuit\n\ncourt asked defense counsel whether there was \u201cany reason why the Court should not\n\naccept [Movant\u201fs] plea of guilty?\u201d to which defense counsel responded, \u201cNo, Your\n\nHonor.\u201d When the circuit court asked Movant whether he had any questions, Movant\n\nresponded, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d The circuit court then accepted Movant\u201fs plea as \u201cfreely,\n\nvoluntarily and intelligently made with a full understanding of the charge and the\n\nconsequences of the plea . . . .\u201d\n\n       Two months later at the sentencing hearing, the circuit court asked Movant\n\nwhether he had anything to say before the court announced the sentence, to which\n\nMovant responded, \u201cNo.\u201d         Regarding counsel\u201fs performance, Movant testified as\n\nfollows:\n\n       THE COURT: Did you have sufficient time to discuss this case with your\n       attorney prior to entering your plea of guilty in this matter?\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      [MOVANT]: Yeah.\n\n      THE COURT: Did your attorney do the things that you asked him to do\n      prior to entering your plea of guilty?\n\n      [MOVANT]: Yes.\n\n                                     *     *      *\n\n      THE COURT: Other than the plea, did your attorney communicate any\n      threats or promises to you to induce you to enter your plea of guilty?\n\n      [MOVANT]: No.\n\n      THE COURT:        Are you satisfied with the services rendered by your\n      attorney?\n\n      [MOVANT]: Yes.\n\n      THE COURT: Is there anything you wish to add concerning the assistance\n      you received from your attorney?\n\n                                     *     *      *\n\n      [MOVANT]: No. He did good.\n\n      THE COURT: Is there anything that you wish me to consider concerning\n      your representation by your attorney before I determine whether or not\n      probable cause exists to believe that you received ineffective assistance of\n      counsel?\n\n      [MOVANT]: No. I\u201fm okay.\n\n\n      Movant\u201fs answers to the circuit court\u201fs questions at both the plea and sentencing\n\nhearings directly refute Movant\u201fs assertion that defense counsel pressured Movant to\n\nenter his plea of guilty. At the plea hearing and again at the sentencing hearing, Movant\n\nindicated that he had had sufficient time to discuss the case with defense counsel before\n\ndeciding to plead guilty. Movant also confirmed at both hearings that no threats or\n\n\n                                           6\n\fpromises had been made to induce him to enter his guilty plea, which directly refutes\n\nMovant\u201fs claim that his plea was the result of pressure from counsel. Moreover, the\n\ncircuit court gave Movant repeated opportunities at both the plea and sentencing hearings\n\nto inform the court that he had been pressured into pleading guilty. Movant, however,\n\nnever indicated that his plea was the result of coercion or \u201cpressure\u201d and instead\n\nunequivocally indicated that he was fully satisfied with counsel\u201fs performance.\n\n       Despite Movant\u201fs repeated assertions that he was satisfied with counsel\u201fs\n\nperformance and that his plea had not been induced by threats or promises, Movant\n\nasserts that the facts of the instant case warrant relief because the circuit court did not\n\nspecifically ask him whether he had been \u201cpressured\u201d into entering his plea. This fact\n\ndoes not nullify the abundant evidence on the record directly refuting Movant\u201fs claim\n\nthat his plea was involuntarily made. It is true that \u201c[a] negative response to a routine\n\ninquiry regarding whether any promises or threats had been made to induce a guilty plea\n\nis too general to encompass all possible statements by counsel to his client.\u201d Conger v.\n\nState, 356 S.W.3d 217, 222 (Mo. App. E.D. 2011) (citation and quotations omitted).\n\nHowever, in a case like the present, where Movant repeatedly indicated that his plea was\n\nnot induced by threats or promises, affirmed that he was satisfied with counsel\u201fs\n\nassistance, made assurances that counsel did everything Movant requested, and made no\n\ncomplaints despite being given \u201cample opportunity to express his duress\u201d to the court, an\n\nevidentiary hearing is properly denied. See id. (citation omitted).\n\n       Under the circumstances, the record clearly refutes Movant\u201fs claim that counsel\n\npressured him into pleading guilty. Accordingly, no evidentiary hearing was required\n\n\n                                             7\n\fand the motion court did not err by denying Movant\u201fs post-conviction motion without an\n\nevidentiary hearing. Point denied.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                       ________________________________\n                                       Philip M.
