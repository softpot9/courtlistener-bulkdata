Consistent with our holding in In re Personal Restraint of\n\nCoggin, No. 89694-1 (Wash. Dec. 11, 2014), a petitioner claiming a public trial\n\n\n\n       1\n          This case was certified to this court by Division One of the Court of Appeals with In re\nPersonal Restraint of Coggin, No. 89694-1 (Wash.

Speight cannot show actual and substantial prejudice arising\n\nfrom the closure; therefore, his petition is denied.\n\n                          FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      On December 3, 2004, Speight drove Kelly Nixon to an inn where Speight\n\nwas performing routine maintenance as a caretaker. While at the inn, Speight\n\nforced Nixon into oral and vaginal intercourse, resulting in torn clothing and\n\ninjuries to Nixon's face and leg.\n\n       Speight was charged with second degree rape in San Juan County. At the\n\nbeginning of jury selection, the judge had jurors fill out questionnaires regarding\n\nany experiences they may have had with a sexual offense. While the jurors were\n\nfilling out these questionnaires, the trial judge, counsel, the clerk, the sheriffs\n\ndeputy, and the court reporter went into the judge's chambers for motions in\n\nlimine. Then, in response to the juror's answers to the questionnaires, 14\n\nprospective jurors were questioned in chambers without the court engaging in the\n\nanalysis required by State v. Bone-Club, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127355\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127355/state-v-bone-club/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995).\n\nSeveral prospective jurors were then excused or dismissed for cause.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fIn re Pers. Restraint ofSpeight, No. 89693-3\n\n\n           Speight was convicted of second degree rape, and in 2006, the Court of\n\nAppeals affirmed his convictions in an unpublished opinion. 2 Speight filed a timely\n\npersonal restraint petition in 2007, arguing that his right to a public trial was\n\nviolated during the in-chambers conference regarding the motions in limine and the\n\nindividual questioning ofjurors. 3 Division One stayed the petition multiple times,\n\npending decisions by this court. Division One of the Court of Appeals then\n\ncertified the case to this court in December 2013, alongside Coggin.\n\n                                                ANALYSIS\n\n           Speight claims that he was denied his constitutional public trial right during\n\npretrial in-limine rulings and the jury selection process.

WASH.\nCONST. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 22. However, Speight does not further analyze whether the public's right\nwas violated during the individual questioning of jurors or when the motions in limine were\ndecided in chambers. Therefore, we will analyze only the public trial right issue under article I,\nsection 22.\n\n\n                                                     3\n\fIn re P~rs. RestraintofSpeight, No. 89693-3\n\n\n         We have repeatedly held that the public trial right applies to jury selection.\n\nSpecifically, it is well established that the public trial right in voir dire proceedings\n\ne~tends   to the qtlestioningof individual prospective jurors.

V3d 1113 (2012). While the right to a public trial is not\n\nabsolute~   the trial court here did not conduct the analysis required by Bone-Club\n\neither implicitly or explicitly and therefore, the closure violated the defendant's\n\nright to a public trial. The State argues that the closure satisfies the five factors\n\nrequired by Bone-Club, but \"[a] trial court is required to consider the Bone-Club\n\nfactors before closing a trial proceeding that should be public.\" Wise, 176 Wn.2d at\n\n12 (citing Bone-Club, 128 Wn.2d at 261 ). From the record, the trial court did not\n    ..\n\n\n\nconsider any of these factors in its decision whether to question individual jurors in\n\nchambers.J.v1oreover, a trial court should \"'resist a closure motion except under the\n\nmost unusual circumstances.\"' Wise, 176 Wn.2d at 11 (quoting Bone-Club, 128\n\n\\yn.2d at 259). Here, the\n                      . defendant's constitutional right to a public\n                                                              .\n                                                                     trial was\n\nviolated.\n\n         We have not yet addressed whether a closure occurs when a trial judge\n\ndiscusses and rules on motions in limine in chambers. This court uses the\n\nexperience and logic test to evaluate whether a particular proceeding implicates the\n\npublic trial right. State v.

See Smith, 181 Wn.2d at 512 n.3 (\"Although the\n\nparties disagreed about whether to characterize these hallway conferences as\n\n'sidebars' or something else, we analyze them as sidebars here because that is the\n\nrole these conferences played in the trial. The analysis would not change for on the\n\nrecord evidentiary conferences in chambers.\"). Since jurors were privately\n\nquestioned, a closure occurred, and we need not decide whether a second closure\n\nexists in this case.\n\n       Because Speight's public trial right violation has merit, we must determine\n\nwhether he must show that he was actually and substantially prejudiced by the\n\nviolation. We addressed the issue-whether actual and substantial prejudice must\n\nbe shown from a public trial right violation in order to obtain relief by personal\n\nrestraint petition-in Coggin. Because the issue is identical and the facts are\n\nsimilar, we incorporate the reasoning from that case here. To summarize,\n\ngenerally, for a petitioner to prevail on collateral review, the petitioner must\n\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that the constitutional error worked to\n\nhis actual and substantial prejudice.

Therefore, in Coggin we held that a petitioner claiming a\n\npublic trial right violation for the first time on collateral review must comply with\n\nthe general rule for personal restraint petitions and show actual and substantial\n\nprejudice.\n\n       As a result, Speight can prevail only if he can show that the public trial right\n\nviolation actually and substantially prejudiced him. Speight does not argue that he\n\nwas actually and substantially prejudiced, nor do the facts suggest that he was. As\n\na result of the individual questioning, he likely received a more fair trial and an\n\nimpartial jury.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fIn re Pers.

(concurring)-Like in the companion case, In re Personal\n\nRestraint of Coggin, No. 89694-1 (Wash.

First, he challenges the trial court's decision to hear argument on\n\nmotions in limine in chambers rather than in the courtroom, alleging that this behavior\n\nimplicated his right to a public trial. While venire members were filling out\n\nquestionnaires in the courtroom, the parties and the judge discussed motions in limine on\n\nthe record in chambers. The State moved to bar the defendant from inquiring about the\n\nalleged victim's drug convictions. The defense brought several motions, including\n\nmotions for the State to disclose certain information, to exclude mention of prior contact\n\nbetween the defendant and complainant, and to exclude mention of the defendant's\n\nmental disorder. In addition to challenging the judge's consideration of these motions in\n\nlimine in chambers, Mr. Speight also makes an identical argument to William Coggin,\n\nnamely that the in-chambers voir dire questioning of some venire members violated his\n\npublic trial rights. In particular, the trial court conducted voir dire in chambers for 14\n\nprospective jurors who had indicated a preference for private questioning on their written\n\nquestionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fNo. 89693-3\nMadsen, C.J. concurring\n\n\n       In State v.

We first consider\n\nwhether the public trial right is even implicated and only then determine whether there\n\nwas in fact a closure and, if so, whether that closure was justified. !d. The lead opinion\n\nacknowledges this framework but does not use it to evaluate the petitioner's motion in\n\nlimine challenge. Lead opinion at 4-5. Instead, the lead opinion reasons that \"[s]ince\n\njurors were privately questioned, a closure occurred, and we need not decide whether a\n\nsecond closure exists in this case.\" Lead opinion at 5. I disagree with this analysis. The\n\npetitioner raises two separate public trial right violations, each of which must be\n\nseparately analyzed. Before reaching the question of whether petitioners must prove\n\nprejudice for collateral challenges to public trial rights, this court should consider, first,\n\nwhether the petitioner may be precluded from bringing the challenge due to invited error\n\nor affirmative waiver and, second, following the three step analysis, whether his public\n\ntrial rights were violated.\n\n       Turning first to the motion in limine issue, I would hold that under the first prong\n\nof the Smith analysis, motions in limine do not implicate public trial rights. As the lead\n\nopinion recognizes, under Smith's first step we use \"the experience and logic test to\n\nevaluate whether a particular proceeding implicates the public trial right.\" Lead opinion\n\nat 4 (citing Sublett, 176 Wn.2d at 73).\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fNo. 89693~3\nMadsen, C .J. concurring\n\n\n       \"The first part of the test, the experience prong, asks 'whether the place and\n\nprocess have historically been open to the press and general public.\"' Sublett, 176 Wn.2d\n\nat 73 (quoting Press-Enter.

Motions in limine concern interlocutory pretrial decisions\n\nmade by the trial court, typically involving legal questions about the admissibility of\n\ncertain evidence. Often these pretrial decisions will be revisited during the course of\n\nproceedings as the evidence develops. As with rulings on contemporaneous objections to\n\nevidence, motions in limine are decided outside the hearing of the jury. See ER 103.\n\n       In Smith, this court applied the experience and logic test to hold that sidebar\n\nconferences involving evidentiary rulings on contemporaneous objections do not\n\nimplicate the public trial right. Smith, slip op. at 6-14. There, we noted the history of\n\nconducting sidebars out of view of the public and the practical difficulties with removing\n\njurors from a courtroom. !d. at 7-8. The reasoning in Smith applies here. During voir\n\ndire in Speight's case, the venire members were using the courtroom to fill out juror\n\nquestionnaires before counsel began voir dire questioning in court. The trial judge used\n\nthis downtime to discuss motions in limine in chambers rather than moving jurors in and\n\nout of the courtroom multiple times.\n\n       The second part of the test, the logic prong, asks \"'whether public access plays a\n\nsignificant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.'\" Sublett,\n\n176 Wn.2d at 73 (quoting Press II, 478 U.S. at 8). \"The guiding principle [for the logic\n\nprong] is 'whether openness will enhance[] both the basic fairness of the criminal trial\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fNo. 89693-3\nMadsen, C.J. concurring\n\n\nand the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the system.\"' Smith,\n\nslip op. at 6-7 (second alteration in original) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting\n\nSublett, 176 Wn.2d at 75). For motions in limine, I believe the answer to these questions\n\nis no. In Smith, this court reasoned that sidebars do not \"invoke any of the concerns the\n\npublic trial right is meant to address regarding perjury, transparency, or the appearance of\n\nfairness.\" Smith, slip op. at 12. Specifically, we noted that the sidebars at issue were\n\nimmediately recorded and made available to the public and emphasized the dense legal\n\nnature of the questions considered during such discussions. Id. at 12-13. The same\n\nreasoning applies in the motion in limine context. Here, the motions in limine considered\n\nin chambers were contemporaneously recorded verbatim. Thus, the public was not\n\ndenied access to the proceedings. As with sidebars, the presence of the public would not\n\nhave added anything to the discussion between the judge and counsel regarding questions\n\nof admissibility under the rules of evidence.\n\n       Applying the experience and logic test, I would hold that as long as these\n\ndiscussions occur on the record and concern primarily evidentiary matters, the public trial\n\nright does not attach.\n\n       Turning to petitioner's second public trial right allegation, I would hold that Mr.\n\nSpeight invited the error of conducting voir dire interviews in chambers. As I outline in\n\nmy concurrence in the companion case Coggin, in the voir dire context the key inquiry is\n\nwhether the defendant \"'actively participated\"' in the conduct that led to the error.\n\nCoggin, slip op.

Similarly, here defense counsel\n\nparticipated in a pretrial telephone conference between the parties and the judge where\n\nthey discussed the creation of a juror questionnaire that would allow jurors to note a\n\npreference for private questioning. Defense counsel then participated in the questioning\n\nof the 14 jurors that occurred in chambers without raising any objection. Though the\n\nlanguage ofthe questionnaire did suggest an \"in court\" private questioning experience to\n\nthe potential jurors, the totality of the circumstances demonstrate that the in-chambers\n\nquestioning was in line with defense counsel's expectations following the pretrial\n\ntelephone call. Defense counsel did more than simply acquiesce to the trial court's\n\ndecision to conduct questioning in chambers; he spoke with opposing counsel and the\n\njudge about the need for a mechanism for private voir dire questioning, agreed to the\n\nquestionnaire proposed by the prosecutor, did not question the judge's decision to hold\n\nthat private questioning in chambers, and in fact engaged in questioning the prospective\n\njurors.

(dissenting)-This case turns largely on the same issue as In\n\nre Personal Restraint of Coggin, No. 89694-1 (Wash. Dec. 11, 2014): whether a\n\npersonal restraint petitioner who suffered a violation of his right to a public trial\n\nshould be denied a new trial when the petitioner does not also allege ineffective\n\nassistance of appellate counsel. I would hold that personal restraint petitioners\n\nshould not have to make a special showing of prejudice beyond establishing the\n\nprejudice of stn1ctural public trial error. The reasoning and facts in both cases on\n\nthis issue do not differ, so I incorporate the reasoning from my dissent in Coggin\n\nhere. Because the lead opinion in both cases \"requires personal restraint petitioners\n\nto prove the impossible, and because its holding erodes the promise of open justice\n\nin our courts, I respectfully dissent.\" Slip op. (dissent) at 2.\n\n      I also point out that because I would grant William Speight's personal restraint\n\npetition on the basis of the improper voir dire closure, it is unnecessary for me to\n\nconsider whether the closed motion in limine hearing also warrants a new trial. The\n\nlead opinion does not have this luxury, though it practically ignores the motion in\n\nlimine issue. Lead opinion at 4-5. Having determined that the closure of individual\n\nvoir dire constituted a public trial violation, the lead opinion moves to the prejudice\n\fIn re Pers. Restraint of Speight (Roland Arthur), 89693-3 (Stephens, J. Dissent)\n\n\n\n\nissue and finds no prejudice. !d. at 5-6 (citing Coggin, slip op. at 10). It concludes\n\nthat Speight was not actually and substantially prejudiced because \"[a]s a result of\n\nthe individual questioning, he likely received a more fair trial and an impartial jury.\"\n\n!d. at 6.\n\n       The individual questioning of jurors took place after the motions in limine\n\nwere heard, so whatever prejudice might have occurred from the closed motion\n\nhearing would already have tainted the trial before voir dire began. Thus, the lead\n\nopinion needs to address the motions hearing, not only as to prejudice but as to\n\nwhether the public trial right attaches to such a hearing. Its conclusion that the closed\n\nvoir dire was not prejudicial because it likely benefited Speight is insufficient; how\n\ndid the closed motion hearing work to his benefit? 1 The lead opinion's prejudice\n\nanalysis is incomplete under its own post hoc analysis and provides no basis to\n\ndismiss this personal restraint petition in its entirety. See Coggin, slip op.

Consistent with our holding in In re Personal Restraint of\n\nCoggin, No. 89694-1 (Wash. Dec. 11, 2014), a petitioner claiming a public trial\n\n\n\n       1\n          This case was certified to this court by Division One of the Court of Appeals with In re\nPersonal Restraint of Coggin, No. 89694-1 (Wash. Dec. 11, 2014). Both cases present the same\ncentral issue but were not consolidated.\n\fIn re Pers. Restraint of Speight, No. 89693-3\n\n\nright violation for the first time on collateral review must show actual and\n\nsubstantial prejudice. Speight cannot show actual and substantial prejudice arising\n\nfrom the closure; therefore, his petition is denied.\n\n                          FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      On December 3, 2004, Speight drove Kelly Nixon to an inn where Speight\n\nwas performing routine maintenance as a caretaker. While at the inn, Speight\n\nforced Nixon into oral and vaginal intercourse, resulting in torn clothing and\n\ninjuries to Nixon's face and leg.\n\n       Speight was charged with second degree rape in San Juan County. At the\n\nbeginning of jury selection, the judge had jurors fill out questionnaires regarding\n\nany experiences they may have had with a sexual offense. While the jurors were\n\nfilling out these questionnaires, the trial judge, counsel, the clerk, the sheriffs\n\ndeputy, and the court reporter went into the judge's chambers for motions in\n\nlimine. Then, in response to the juror's answers to the questionnaires, 14\n\nprospective jurors were questioned in chambers without the court engaging in the\n\nanalysis required by State v. Bone-Club, 128 Wn.2d 254, 906 P.2d 325 (1995).\n\nSeveral prospective jurors were then excused or dismissed for cause.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\fIn re Pers. Restraint ofSpeight, No. 89693-3\n\n\n           Speight was convicted of second degree rape, and in 2006, the Court of\n\nAppeals affirmed his convictions in an unpublished opinion. 2 Speight filed a timely\n\npersonal restraint petition in 2007, arguing that his right to a public trial was\n\nviolated during the in-chambers conference regarding the motions in limine and the\n\nindividual questioning ofjurors. 3 Division One stayed the petition multiple times,\n\npending decisions by this court. Division One of the Court of Appeals then\n\ncertified the case to this court in December 2013, alongside Coggin.\n\n                                                ANALYSIS\n\n           Speight claims that he was denied his constitutional public trial right during\n\npretrial in-limine rulings and the jury selection process. A criminal defendant has a\n\nrig;ht to a public trial as guaranteed by our state and federal constitutions. U.S.\n\nCONST. amend. VI; WASH. CONST. art. I,\u00a7 22 (providing \"the accused shall have\n\nthe right ... tohaye a speedy public trial\"); State v. Paumier, 176 Wn.2d 29, 34,\n\n288 P.3d 1126 (2012).\n ,\u2022   ',       .  '\n\n\n\n\n----------\u00b7---\n           2\n               State v. Speight, noted at 136 Wn. App. 1006 (2006).\n           3\n         In his opening brief, Speight asserts that his article I, section 22 rights to a public trial\nand the public and !)tess's article I, section 10 rights to a public trial were violated. WASH.\nCONST. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 22. However, Speight does not further analyze whether the public's right\nwas violated during the individual questioning of jurors or when the motions in limine were\ndecided in chambers. Therefore, we will analyze only the public trial right issue under article I,\nsection 22.\n\n\n                                                     3\n\fIn re P~rs. RestraintofSpeight, No. 89693-3\n\n\n         We have repeatedly held that the public trial right applies to jury selection.\n\nSpecifically, it is well established that the public trial right in voir dire proceedings\n\ne~tends   to the qtlestioningof individual prospective jurors. State v. Wise, 176\n\nWn.2d 1, l(j719, 288. V3d 1113 (2012). While the right to a public trial is not\n\nabsolute~   the trial court here did not conduct the analysis required by Bone-Club\n\neither implicitly or explicitly and therefore, the closure violated the defendant's\n\nright to a public trial. The State argues that the closure satisfies the five factors\n\nrequired by Bone-Club, but \"[a] trial court is required to consider the Bone-Club\n\nfactors before closing a trial proceeding that should be public.\" Wise, 176 Wn.2d at\n\n12 (citing Bone-Club, 128 Wn.2d at 261 ). From the record, the trial court did not\n    ..\n\n\n\nconsider any of these factors in its decision whether to question individual jurors in\n\nchambers.J.v1oreover, a trial court should \"'resist a closure motion except under the\n\nmost unusual circumstances.\"' Wise, 176 Wn.2d at 11 (quoting Bone-Club, 128\n\n\\yn.2d at 259). Here, the\n                      . defendant's constitutional right to a public\n                                                              .\n                                                                     trial was\n\nviolated.\n\n         We have not yet addressed whether a closure occurs when a trial judge\n\ndiscusses and rules on motions in limine in chambers. This court uses the\n\nexperience and logic test to evaluate whether a particular proceeding implicates the\n\npublic trial right. State v. Sublett, 176 Wn.2d 58, 73, 292 P.3d 715 (2012). In State\n\n                                             4\n\fIn re Pers. Restraint of Speight, No. 89693-3\n\n\nv. Smith, 181 Wn.2d 508, 334 P.3d 1049 (2014), we alluded to the fact that\n\nevidentiary motions may not implicate the public trial right, but because sidebars,\n\nand not evidentiary conferences, were at issue in that case we did not decide\n\ndefinitively one way or the other. See Smith, 181 Wn.2d at 512 n.3 (\"Although the\n\nparties disagreed about whether to characterize these hallway conferences as\n\n'sidebars' or something else, we analyze them as sidebars here because that is the\n\nrole these conferences played in the trial. The analysis would not change for on the\n\nrecord evidentiary conferences in chambers.\"). Since jurors were privately\n\nquestioned, a closure occurred, and we need not decide whether a second closure\n\nexists in this case.\n\n       Because Speight's public trial right violation has merit, we must determine\n\nwhether he must show that he was actually and substantially prejudiced by the\n\nviolation. We addressed the issue-whether actual and substantial prejudice must\n\nbe shown from a public trial right violation in order to obtain relief by personal\n\nrestraint petition-in Coggin. Because the issue is identical and the facts are\n\nsimilar, we incorporate the reasoning from that case here. To summarize,\n\ngenerally, for a petitioner to prevail on collateral review, the petitioner must\n\nestablish by a preponderance of the evidence that the constitutional error worked to\n\nhis actual and substantial prejudice. In re Pers. Restraint of St. Pierre, 118 Wn.2d\n\n                                           5\n\fIn re Pers. Restraint of Speight, No. 89693-3\n\n\n321,328, 823 P.2d 492 (1992). We carved out an exception to this general rule in\n\nIn rePersonalRestraintofMorris, 176 Wn.2d 157, 166,288 P.3d 1140 (2012),\n\nwhere we held that we will presume prejudice for a petitioner who alleges a public\n\ntrial right violation through an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim.\n\nBut in Coggin we refused to extend this exception any further and held that our\n\ninterest in finality required us to draw a line and not presume prejudice when a\n\npetitioner raises a public trial right violation for the first time on collateral review.\n\nCoggin, slip op. at 10. Therefore, in Coggin we held that a petitioner claiming a\n\npublic trial right violation for the first time on collateral review must comply with\n\nthe general rule for personal restraint petitions and show actual and substantial\n\nprejudice.\n\n       As a result, Speight can prevail only if he can show that the public trial right\n\nviolation actually and substantially prejudiced him. Speight does not argue that he\n\nwas actually and substantially prejudiced, nor do the facts suggest that he was. As\n\na result of the individual questioning, he likely received a more fair trial and an\n\nimpartial jury.\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fIn re Pers.

(concurring)-Like in the companion case, In re Personal\n\nRestraint of Coggin, No. 89694-1 (Wash. Dec. 11, 2014), I agree with the lead opinion's\n\ndecision to deny Roland Speight's personal restraint petition, but for different reasons.\n\nFirst, I believe that this court must decide whether motions in limine implicate the public\n\ntrial right, and I would decide this question in the negative. Second, I would hold that\n\nMr. Speight invited the judge to conduct portions of voir dire in chambers. Thus, in\n\ncontrast to the lead opinion and in line with my concurrence in Coggin, I believe we need\n\nnot determine the prejudice showing required of personal restraint petitioners.\n\n       Nevertheless, because guidance is needed I would agree with the majority that the\n\nerror here, failure to engage in the analysis outlined in State v. Bone-Club, 128 Wn.2d\n\n254, 906 P.2d 325 (1995), requires a petitioner in a personal restraint petition to prove\n\nprejudice unless he can demonstrate that the error in his case '\"infect[ ed] the entire trial\n\nprocess\"' and deprive the defendant of \"'basic protections,\"' without which \"'no criminal\n\fNo. 89693-3\nMadsen, C.J. concurring\n\n\npunishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\"' Neder v.

Ed. 2d 460 (1986)).\n\n                                         Discussion\n\n       In contrast to the companion case, here the petitioner alleges two different public\n\ntrial right violations. First, he challenges the trial court's decision to hear argument on\n\nmotions in limine in chambers rather than in the courtroom, alleging that this behavior\n\nimplicated his right to a public trial. While venire members were filling out\n\nquestionnaires in the courtroom, the parties and the judge discussed motions in limine on\n\nthe record in chambers. The State moved to bar the defendant from inquiring about the\n\nalleged victim's drug convictions. The defense brought several motions, including\n\nmotions for the State to disclose certain information, to exclude mention of prior contact\n\nbetween the defendant and complainant, and to exclude mention of the defendant's\n\nmental disorder. In addition to challenging the judge's consideration of these motions in\n\nlimine in chambers, Mr. Speight also makes an identical argument to William Coggin,\n\nnamely that the in-chambers voir dire questioning of some venire members violated his\n\npublic trial rights. In particular, the trial court conducted voir dire in chambers for 14\n\nprospective jurors who had indicated a preference for private questioning on their written\n\nquestionnaire.\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fNo. 89693-3\nMadsen, C.J. concurring\n\n\n       In State v. Smith, this court outlined a three step inquiry to assess alleged public\n\ntrial right violations. 181 Wn.2d 508, 513,334 P.3d 1049 (2014) (citing State v. Sublett,\n\n176 Wn.2d 58, 92, 292 P.3d 715 (2012) (Madsen, C.J., concurring)). We first consider\n\nwhether the public trial right is even implicated and only then determine whether there\n\nwas in fact a closure and, if so, whether that closure was justified. !d. The lead opinion\n\nacknowledges this framework but does not use it to evaluate the petitioner's motion in\n\nlimine challenge. Lead opinion at 4-5. Instead, the lead opinion reasons that \"[s]ince\n\njurors were privately questioned, a closure occurred, and we need not decide whether a\n\nsecond closure exists in this case.\" Lead opinion at 5. I disagree with this analysis. The\n\npetitioner raises two separate public trial right violations, each of which must be\n\nseparately analyzed. Before reaching the question of whether petitioners must prove\n\nprejudice for collateral challenges to public trial rights, this court should consider, first,\n\nwhether the petitioner may be precluded from bringing the challenge due to invited error\n\nor affirmative waiver and, second, following the three step analysis, whether his public\n\ntrial rights were violated.\n\n       Turning first to the motion in limine issue, I would hold that under the first prong\n\nof the Smith analysis, motions in limine do not implicate public trial rights. As the lead\n\nopinion recognizes, under Smith's first step we use \"the experience and logic test to\n\nevaluate whether a particular proceeding implicates the public trial right.\" Lead opinion\n\nat 4 (citing Sublett, 176 Wn.2d at 73).\n\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fNo. 89693~3\nMadsen, C .J. concurring\n\n\n       \"The first part of the test, the experience prong, asks 'whether the place and\n\nprocess have historically been open to the press and general public.\"' Sublett, 176 Wn.2d\n\nat 73 (quoting Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court (Press II), 478 U.S. 1, 8, 106 S. Ct.\n\n2735, 92 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1986)). Motions in limine concern interlocutory pretrial decisions\n\nmade by the trial court, typically involving legal questions about the admissibility of\n\ncertain evidence. Often these pretrial decisions will be revisited during the course of\n\nproceedings as the evidence develops. As with rulings on contemporaneous objections to\n\nevidence, motions in limine are decided outside the hearing of the jury. See ER 103.\n\n       In Smith, this court applied the experience and logic test to hold that sidebar\n\nconferences involving evidentiary rulings on contemporaneous objections do not\n\nimplicate the public trial right. Smith, slip op. at 6-14. There, we noted the history of\n\nconducting sidebars out of view of the public and the practical difficulties with removing\n\njurors from a courtroom. !d. at 7-8. The reasoning in Smith applies here. During voir\n\ndire in Speight's case, the venire members were using the courtroom to fill out juror\n\nquestionnaires before counsel began voir dire questioning in court. The trial judge used\n\nthis downtime to discuss motions in limine in chambers rather than moving jurors in and\n\nout of the courtroom multiple times.\n\n       The second part of the test, the logic prong, asks \"'whether public access plays a\n\nsignificant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.'\" Sublett,\n\n176 Wn.2d at 73 (quoting Press II, 478 U.S. at 8). \"The guiding principle [for the logic\n\nprong] is 'whether openness will enhance[] both the basic fairness of the criminal trial\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fNo. 89693-3\nMadsen, C.J. concurring\n\n\nand the appearance of fairness so essential to public confidence in the system.\"' Smith,\n\nslip op. at 6-7 (second alteration in original) (internal quotations omitted) (quoting\n\nSublett, 176 Wn.2d at 75). For motions in limine, I believe the answer to these questions\n\nis no. In Smith, this court reasoned that sidebars do not \"invoke any of the concerns the\n\npublic trial right is meant to address regarding perjury, transparency, or the appearance of\n\nfairness.\" Smith, slip op. at 12. Specifically, we noted that the sidebars at issue were\n\nimmediately recorded and made available to the public and emphasized the dense legal\n\nnature of the questions considered during such discussions. Id. at 12-13. The same\n\nreasoning applies in the motion in limine context. Here, the motions in limine considered\n\nin chambers were contemporaneously recorded verbatim. Thus, the public was not\n\ndenied access to the proceedings. As with sidebars, the presence of the public would not\n\nhave added anything to the discussion between the judge and counsel regarding questions\n\nof admissibility under the rules of evidence.\n\n       Applying the experience and logic test, I would hold that as long as these\n\ndiscussions occur on the record and concern primarily evidentiary matters, the public trial\n\nright does not attach.\n\n       Turning to petitioner's second public trial right allegation, I would hold that Mr.\n\nSpeight invited the error of conducting voir dire interviews in chambers. As I outline in\n\nmy concurrence in the companion case Coggin, in the voir dire context the key inquiry is\n\nwhether the defendant \"'actively participated\"' in the conduct that led to the error.\n\nCoggin, slip op. (concurrence) at2-3 (quoting State v. Wise, 176 Wn.2d 1,15 n.8, 288\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\fNo. 89693-3\nMadsen, C.J. concurring\n\n\nP.3d 1113 (2002)). In State v. Momah, we reasoned that invited error principles applied\n\nwhere defense counsel agreed beforehand to a juror questionnaire that permitted\n\nindividual questioning, never objected to the proposal to conduct this questioning in\n\nchambers (presumably because the private questioning benefited his client), and actively\n\nparticipated in the questioning. 167 Wn.2d 140, 145-46, 153-56, 217 P.3d 321 (2009);\n\nsee also Wise, 176 Wn.2d at 15 n.8 (reaffirming that defendants can invite public trial\n\nviolations, pointing to factors outlined in Momah). Similarly, here defense counsel\n\nparticipated in a pretrial telephone conference between the parties and the judge where\n\nthey discussed the creation of a juror questionnaire that would allow jurors to note a\n\npreference for private questioning. Defense counsel then participated in the questioning\n\nof the 14 jurors that occurred in chambers without raising any objection. Though the\n\nlanguage ofthe questionnaire did suggest an \"in court\" private questioning experience to\n\nthe potential jurors, the totality of the circumstances demonstrate that the in-chambers\n\nquestioning was in line with defense counsel's expectations following the pretrial\n\ntelephone call. Defense counsel did more than simply acquiesce to the trial court's\n\ndecision to conduct questioning in chambers; he spoke with opposing counsel and the\n\njudge about the need for a mechanism for private voir dire questioning, agreed to the\n\nquestionnaire proposed by the prosecutor, did not question the judge's decision to hold\n\nthat private questioning in chambers, and in fact engaged in questioning the prospective\n\njurors. By all accounts, defense counsel \"actively participated\" in the in chambers\n\nquestioning of jurors and consequently invited the public trial error that resulted.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fNo. 89693-3\nMadsen, C.J. concurring\n\n\n       In sum, I would address petitioner's motion in limine challenge but would hold\n\nthat under our experience and logic test, motions in limine do not implicate public trial\n\nrights. I would also dismiss petitioner's challenge to the voir dire procedure on invited\n\nerror grounds and thus would not reach the question of prejudice considered by the\n\nmajority. I concur in the majority's decision to deny Mr. Speight's petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fNo. 89693-3\nMadsen, C .J. concurring\n\n\n\n\n                           8\n\fIn re Pers.

(dissenting)-This case turns largely on the same issue as In\n\nre Personal Restraint of Coggin, No. 89694-1 (Wash. Dec. 11, 2014): whether a\n\npersonal restraint petitioner who suffered a violation of his right to a public trial\n\nshould be denied a new trial when the petitioner does not also allege ineffective\n\nassistance of appellate counsel. I would hold that personal restraint petitioners\n\nshould not have to make a special showing of prejudice beyond establishing the\n\nprejudice of stn1ctural public trial error. The reasoning and facts in both cases on\n\nthis issue do not differ, so I incorporate the reasoning from my dissent in Coggin\n\nhere. Because the lead opinion in both cases \"requires personal restraint petitioners\n\nto prove the impossible, and because its holding erodes the promise of open justice\n\nin our courts, I respectfully dissent.\" Slip op. (dissent) at 2.\n\n      I also point out that because I would grant William Speight's personal restraint\n\npetition on the basis of the improper voir dire closure, it is unnecessary for me to\n\nconsider whether the closed motion in limine hearing also warrants a new trial. The\n\nlead opinion does not have this luxury, though it practically ignores the motion in\n\nlimine issue. Lead opinion at 4-5. Having determined that the closure of individual\n\nvoir dire constituted a public trial violation, the lead opinion moves to the prejudice\n\fIn re Pers. Restraint of Speight (Roland Arthur), 89693-3 (Stephens, J. Dissent)\n\n\n\n\nissue and finds no prejudice. !d. at 5-6 (citing Coggin, slip op. at 10). It concludes\n\nthat Speight was not actually and substantially prejudiced because \"[a]s a result of\n\nthe individual questioning, he likely received a more fair trial and an impartial jury.\"\n\n!d. at 6.\n\n       The individual questioning of jurors took place after the motions in limine\n\nwere heard, so whatever prejudice might have occurred from the closed motion\n\nhearing would already have tainted the trial before voir dire began. Thus, the lead\n\nopinion needs to address the motions hearing, not only as to prejudice but as to\n\nwhether the public trial right attaches to such a hearing. Its conclusion that the closed\n\nvoir dire was not prejudicial because it likely benefited Speight is insufficient; how\n\ndid the closed motion hearing work to his benefit? 1 The lead opinion's prejudice\n\nanalysis is incomplete under its own post hoc analysis and provides no basis to\n\ndismiss this personal restraint petition in its entirety. See Coggin, slip op. (dissent)\n\nat 9 n.2 (explaining that the lead opinion's prejudice analysis constitutes a post hoc\n\nappellate Bone-Club 2 inquiry).\n\n\n        1\n         The State claims that the motions in limine occurred in chambers because the\nvenire was completing questionnaires in the courtroom. Resp. toPers. Restraint Pet. at 4.\nSo, it might be argued that the closure facilitated selecting an impartial jury because the\nclosure shielded prospective jurors from exposure to potentially inadmissible evidence.\nThis argument fails because the \"purpose of a motion in limine is to dispose oflega1 matters\nso counsel will not be forced to make comments in the presence of the jury which might\nprejudice his presentation.\" State v. Evans, 96 Wn.2d 119, 123, 634 P.2d 845 (1981). The\nvenire could have filled out questionnaires elsewhere while the court considered the\nmotions in limine in open court. See In re Pers. Restraint of Orange, 152 Wn.2d 795, 810,\n100 P.3d 291 (2004) (concerns stemming from \"courtroom management and convenience\"\nwithout consideration of-the-public-trial right was insufficient to justify closure of voir\ndire).\n       2\n         State v.
