Taylor\n\nalso states that he has met the standard for obtaining a\n\npreliminary injunction.   Because Taylor has not shown that he has\n\na substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the above\n\nclaims, Taylor has not shown that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his motion for a preliminary injunction or\n\nthat exceptional circumstances exist which warrant the reversal\n\nof the denial of his motion.
