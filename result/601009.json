Fitch appeals from an order of the district court affirming a decision of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Virginia which held Fitch liable to his former employer, Robertson Electric Company (REC), for conversion of corporate assets.  REC cross-appeals the district court's denial of its claim for punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central question presented in this case is whether REC ratified unauthorized bonus payments totalling $30,000 that Fitch caused to be paid to himself in 1990.  The district court determined that REC's bookkeeper, Emily Pace, had actual knowledge of the bonus payments, but that Fitch had misinformed her that the payments had been authorized by REC's president and sole shareholder, William Robertson.  In fact, William Robertson, the only REC officer who had the power to ratify the unauthorized payments, was never told of the payments by either Fitch or Pace, and did not learn of their existence until after the last installment had been paid, at which point he fired Fitch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting that under Virginia law, ratification can occur only where the principal has full knowledge of the material facts concerning the transaction in question, see White v.

Although the court thus rejected Fitch's defense to REC's conversion action, it declined to disturb the bankruptcy court's finding that an award of punitive damages to REC would be inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have read the briefs, heard oral argument, and given thorough consideration to the parties' contentions.
