Both appeal, contending that insufficient evidence of their guilt was offered at\n\ntrial.\n\n\n\n         *\n               Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should\nnot be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n       Close to midnight on April 26, 2000, Laredo police officer Arturo Vela (\u201cVela\u201d) was on\n\npatrol when a fellow officer was dispatched to an intersection near the banks of the Rio Grande\n\nbased on a report of suspicious activity, i.e., that unidentified individuals were loading bundles\n\ninto a white Nissan Maxima.\n\n       Vela decided to proceed to the location, and while en route, spotted a white Maxima,\n\nwhich appeared to be heavily loaded, traveling away from the reported location. After observing\n\nthe Maxima commit two traffic infractions, Vela activated his vehicle\u2019s flashing lights and\n\nattempted to pull the Maxima over. The driver of the Maxima did not stop, however, and\n\ncontinued driving at normal speed for approximately five blocks before pulling into the driveway\n\nof a residence located at 1911 Santa Rita Street, a location approximately one-half mile from\n\nwhere the Maxima was loaded.\n\n       As Vela exited his patrol car, the driver of the Maxima, later identified as Ezequiel\n\nVillarreal (\u201cVillarreal\u201d), also exited. Shortly thereafter, two other men, later identified as Torres\n\nand Agredano, exited the Maxima. Their exit was somewhat unusual because both individuals\n\nexited through the right, front passenger door of the four-door vehicle.1 Both then walked\n\ntowards the residence and waited in front of it. It was later determined that Agredano and\n\nVillarreal both lived in the 1911 Santa Rita Street residence.\n\n       At approximately the same time, officer Christi Hinojosa (\u201cHinojosa\u201d) arrived at the scene.\n\nVela asked her to make contact with Torres and Agredano. As she approached the fence to the\n\n\n       1\n        The Maxima has only two bucket seats in the front.\n\n                                                  2\n\fproperty, she observed Torres washing his hands under an outside water spigot. Speaking\n\nSpanish, she told both men to \u201ccome over here,\u201d at which point both men turned and ran.\n\n       Hinojosa radioed to the dispatcher and requested that other officers be sent to the area to\n\nset up a perimeter. Additional officers subsequently arrived and aided in the search for Agredano\n\nand Torres. Agredano was found by officers hiding near the rear of the 1911 Santa Rita\n\nresidence. Torres was found hiding between a junked vehicle and a fence line a few blocks away.\n\nTorres was crouched in a squatting position; he was sweating, out of breath and very nervous.\n\nDespite being found in a squatting position, he claimed to be relieving himself. He stated that he\n\nwas afraid because he was an illegal alien. Both Agredano and Torres were returned to the 1911\n\nSanta Rita residence and Vela identified them as the individuals who exited the Maxima.\n\n       While the search for Agredano and Torres was taking place, Vela approached the Maxima\n\nand noticed some large bundles that filled the entire back seat of the vehicle. Vela subsequently\n\nrequested a drug-sniffing dog. When the dog alerted to the vehicle, Vela entered the vehicle and\n\nremoved the bundles. After inspection and testing, it was determined that the bundles were\n\nduffle-bags wrapped in black tape, containing 722 pounds of 75% pure cocaine in individual\n\nbricks with an estimated value of over six million dollars. The wrapped duffle bags were too\n\nheavy for one person to lift.\n\n       An inventory search of the vehicle was later conducted. That search yielded a \u201cfanny\n\npack,\u201d containing a cell phone, a firearm magazine containing live ammunition and a wallet. The\n\nwallet contained a Mexican driver\u2019s license issued to Torres.\n\n       At trial, Yolanda Flores, a friend of the Villarreal family, testified that she visited the 1911\n\nSanta Rita residence on April 26, 2000 and that when she left at 10:45 p.m. Agredano was\n\n\n                                                  3\n\foutside drinking with Hector. Julio Villarreal, Agredano\u2019s grandfather, testified that he returned\n\nfrom walking Yolanda Flores home at approximately 11:00 p.m. and saw that Hector and\n\nAgredano were still outside. He further testified that he was in his bedroom at the 1911 Santa\n\nRita residence on April 26, 2000 from 11:00 p.m. until the police arrived, and that, though he\n\ncould not see them, he heard Hector and Agredano talking outside his window during this period.\n\n                                               ANALYSIS\n\nWe review the denial of a properly made Rule 29 motion for sufficiency of the evidence.2\n\n        \u201cIn assessing these challenges, this court must view the evidence in the light most\n        favorable to the jury verdict and affirm if a rational trier of fact could find that the\n        government proved all essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt. We consider\n        the countervailing evidence as well as the evidence that supports the verdict. It is\n        not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence\n        or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt provided a\n        reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a\n        reasonable doubt. The jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of\n        the evidence. If, however, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n        government, gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt\n        and a theory of innocence, the conviction should be reversed.\n\nUnited States v. Richards, 204 F.3d 177, 206 (5th Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).\n\n        Because Torres did not put on any evidence, as to Torres this court considers only the\n\nevidence offered in the Government\u2019s case-in-chief. United States v. Casilla, 20 F.3d 600, 605-06\n\n(5th Cir. 1994). In contrast, because Agredano did put on evidence, to wit, the testimony of\n\nYolanda Flores and Julio Villarreal, our review of his conviction involves consideration of that\n\ntestimony as well. Id.\n\n        To obtain a conviction for aiding and abetting the possession of cocaine with intent to\n\n\n        2\n         The parties dispute the standard of review to be applied to the review of Agredano\u2019s conviction.\nThe United States contends we should review for plain error, Agredano contends we should apply the\nsufficiency standard. Because the result is the same under either standard, we need not resolve this dispute.\n\n                                                     4\n\fdistribute, the government was required to prove \u201cthat the elements of the substantive offense3\n\noccurred and that [Torres and Agredano] associated with the criminal venture, purposefully\n\nparticipated in the criminal activity, and sought by [their] actions to make the venture succeed.\n\nAssociate means that the defendant shares in the principal\u2019s criminal intent. Participate means that\n\nthe defendant engages in some affirmative conduct designed to aid the venture or assists the\n\nperpetrator of the crime.\u201d United States v. Garcia, 242 F.3d 593, 596 (5th Cir. 2001) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n        In order to obtain a conviction for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute,\n\nthe government was required to prove \u201c(1) the existence of an agreement between two or more\n\npersons to violate federal narcotics laws; (2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the agreement; and (3)\n\nthe defendant\u2019s voluntary participation in the agreement.\u201d United States v. DeLeon, 247 F.3d\n\n593, 596 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n        Because of the similarity of the conspiracy and the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d elements, the\n\nevidence supporting the two will often be the same. United States v. Delgado, 256 F.3d 264,\n\n274-75 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\n        Both defendants contend that their mere presence at the scene of the arrest was\n\ninsufficient to support conviction on either count, in part because they contend that no reasonable\n\njury could have concluded that they were one of the passengers in the Maxima.\n\n\n\n        3\n          In order to obtain a conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the Government\nwas required to prove: (1) knowing (2) possession of cocaine (3) with intent to distribute it. United States\nv. Delgado, 256 F.3d 264, 274 (5th Cir. 2001). The appellants do not contend that the Government failed\nto prove the substantive possession offense. The amount of the drugs in the car and the fact that they filled\nthe entire back seat alone is sufficient to support a finding on all three elements as to at least one of the\noccupants of the vehicle.\n\n                                                      5\n\f        As an initial matter, while the defendants are correct that establishing their presence in the\n\nMaxima was an indispensable part of the Government\u2019s case, there was overwhelming evidence\n\nsupporting it. Vela testified that Agredano and Torres were the two men who exited the Maxima\n\nafter Villarreal. Hinojosa testified that Agredano and Torres were the two men who fled from the\n\n1911 Santa Rita residence. Finally, Agredano and Torres were both found hiding at midnight very\n\nnear the scene. The purported inconsistencies in the trial evidence that the defendants mention in\n\ntheir briefs provide no basis to disturb the jury verdict. United States v. Garza, 990 F.2d 171, 175\n\n(5th Cir. 1993) (\u201cThe jury is the ultimate arbiter of witnesses\u2019 credibility and is free to choose\n\namong reasonable constructions of evidence.\u201d).\n\n        Next, while Agredano and Torres are also correct that proof of their mere presence at the\n\nscene was insufficient to support the convictions, United States v. Dean, 59 F.3d 1479, 1486 (5th\n\nCir. 1995) (\u201cMere presence and association alone cannot support a conspiracy conviction.\u201d), they\n\nwere more than merely present.\n\n        The evidence demonstrated, or allowed the jury to reasonably conclude, that Villareal and\n\nTorres picked up Agredano at nearly midnight shortly before picking up 6 million dollars of\n\ncocaine a half mile away, cocaine wrapped in bundles too heavy for one man to carry.4 After\n\nloading the drugs, the three men stuffed themselves into a compact car with a backseat full of 722\n\npounds cocaine. Upon arriving at Villareal and Agredano\u2019s residence chased by the police, Torres\n\nand Agredano left the car together and Torres immediately found a water spigot, presumably to\n\n\n\n        4\n          See United States v. Martinez-Moncivais, 14 F.3d 1030, 1035 (5th Cir. 1994)(\u201c[I]t is reasonable\nfor a jury to conclude that in the course of transporting millions of dollars of readily marketable [cocaine]\nthrough channels that should lack the protections of organized society, a prudent smuggler is not likely to\nsuffer the presence of unaffiliated bystanders.\u201d) (citations omitted).\n\n                                                      6\n\fwash the cocaine residue off his hands. When approached by the police the men fled. United\n\nStates v. Lopez, 979 F.2d 1024, 1030 (5th Cir. 1992). These facts constitute more than mere\n\npresence.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n       In light of the foregoing discussion, the convictions of Agredano and Torres are hereby\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                       IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                                 FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                         _______________________________________\n\n                                       No. 00-41343\n                        _______________________________________\n\n\n\n         UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ,\n\n                                                         Plaintiff \u2013 Appellee,\n\n                               v.\n\n         ALBERTO JOEL TORRES; NORBERTO AGREDANO,\n\n                                                         Defendants \u2013 Appellants.\n\n                        -----------------------------------------------------------\n                           Appeal from the United States District Court\n                                  for the Southern District of Texas\n                                    U.S.D.C.

The driver of the Maxima did not stop, however, and\n\ncontinued driving at normal speed for approximately five blocks before pulling into the driveway\n\nof a residence located at 1911 Santa Rita Street, a location approximately one-half mile from\n\nwhere the Maxima was loaded.\n\n       As Vela exited his patrol car, the driver of the Maxima, later identified as Ezequiel\n\nVillarreal (\u201cVillarreal\u201d), also exited. Shortly thereafter, two other men, later identified as Torres\n\nand Agredano, exited the Maxima. Their exit was somewhat unusual because both individuals\n\nexited through the right, front passenger door of the four-door vehicle.1 Both then walked\n\ntowards the residence and waited in front of it. It was later determined that Agredano and\n\nVillarreal both lived in the 1911 Santa Rita Street residence.\n\n       At approximately the same time, officer Christi Hinojosa (\u201cHinojosa\u201d) arrived at the scene.\n\nVela asked her to make contact with Torres and Agredano. As she approached the fence to the\n\n\n       1\n        The Maxima has only two bucket seats in the front.\n\n                                                  2\n\fproperty, she observed Torres washing his hands under an outside water spigot. Speaking\n\nSpanish, she told both men to \u201ccome over here,\u201d at which point both men turned and ran.\n\n       Hinojosa radioed to the dispatcher and requested that other officers be sent to the area to\n\nset up a perimeter. Additional officers subsequently arrived and aided in the search for Agredano\n\nand Torres. Agredano was found by officers hiding near the rear of the 1911 Santa Rita\n\nresidence. Torres was found hiding between a junked vehicle and a fence line a few blocks away.\n\nTorres was crouched in a squatting position; he was sweating, out of breath and very nervous.\n\nDespite being found in a squatting position, he claimed to be relieving himself. He stated that he\n\nwas afraid because he was an illegal alien. Both Agredano and Torres were returned to the 1911\n\nSanta Rita residence and Vela identified them as the individuals who exited the Maxima.\n\n       While the search for Agredano and Torres was taking place, Vela approached the Maxima\n\nand noticed some large bundles that filled the entire back seat of the vehicle. Vela subsequently\n\nrequested a drug-sniffing dog. When the dog alerted to the vehicle, Vela entered the vehicle and\n\nremoved the bundles. After inspection and testing, it was determined that the bundles were\n\nduffle-bags wrapped in black tape, containing 722 pounds of 75% pure cocaine in individual\n\nbricks with an estimated value of over six million dollars. The wrapped duffle bags were too\n\nheavy for one person to lift.\n\n       An inventory search of the vehicle was later conducted. That search yielded a \u201cfanny\n\npack,\u201d containing a cell phone, a firearm magazine containing live ammunition and a wallet. The\n\nwallet contained a Mexican driver\u2019s license issued to Torres.\n\n       At trial, Yolanda Flores, a friend of the Villarreal family, testified that she visited the 1911\n\nSanta Rita residence on April 26, 2000 and that when she left at 10:45 p.m. Agredano was\n\n\n                                                  3\n\foutside drinking with Hector. Julio Villarreal, Agredano\u2019s grandfather, testified that he returned\n\nfrom walking Yolanda Flores home at approximately 11:00 p.m. and saw that Hector and\n\nAgredano were still outside. He further testified that he was in his bedroom at the 1911 Santa\n\nRita residence on April 26, 2000 from 11:00 p.m. until the police arrived, and that, though he\n\ncould not see them, he heard Hector and Agredano talking outside his window during this period.\n\n                                               ANALYSIS\n\nWe review the denial of a properly made Rule 29 motion for sufficiency of the evidence.2\n\n        \u201cIn assessing these challenges, this court must view the evidence in the light most\n        favorable to the jury verdict and affirm if a rational trier of fact could find that the\n        government proved all essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt. We consider\n        the countervailing evidence as well as the evidence that supports the verdict. It is\n        not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence\n        or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt provided a\n        reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence establishes guilt beyond a\n        reasonable doubt. The jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of\n        the evidence. If, however, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n        government, gives equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt\n        and a theory of innocence, the conviction should be reversed.\n\nUnited States v.

The appellants do not contend that the Government failed\nto prove the substantive possession offense. The amount of the drugs in the car and the fact that they filled\nthe entire back seat alone is sufficient to support a finding on all three elements as to at least one of the\noccupants of the vehicle.\n\n                                                      5\n\f        As an initial matter, while the defendants are correct that establishing their presence in the\n\nMaxima was an indispensable part of the Government\u2019s case, there was overwhelming evidence\n\nsupporting it. Vela testified that Agredano and Torres were the two men who exited the Maxima\n\nafter Villarreal. Hinojosa testified that Agredano and Torres were the two men who fled from the\n\n1911 Santa Rita residence. Finally, Agredano and Torres were both found hiding at midnight very\n\nnear the scene. The purported inconsistencies in the trial evidence that the defendants mention in\n\ntheir briefs provide no basis to disturb the jury verdict. United States v.
