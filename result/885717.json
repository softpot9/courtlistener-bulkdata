We affirm.\n\n\u00b63 The following issues are presented on appeal:\n\n\u00b64 1. Is Phillips' sentence illegal because the District Court erred in interpreting and\napplying Montana's correctional and sentencing statutes?\n\n\u00b65 2. Do the procedures used by Montana's courts in maintaining sentencing data violate\nPhillips' constitutional rights to due process under the Montana and U.S. Constitutions?\n\n\u00b66 3. Do Phillips' convictions and sentences for conspiracy and theft violate Montana\nstatutes and the Montana and U.S. Constitutions?\n\n\n                                                         BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b67 By the time Phillips was convicted of burglary in 1995, he had been involuntarily\ndismissed from high school and the Job Corps. The District Court deferred sentencing\nPhillips on condition he participate successfully in a community-based alternative, which\nprovided housing and mentoring to Phillips. Within a year, he was involved in a physical\naltercation, provided a BB gun for use in a robbery, and failed to complete his chemical\ndependency regimen. The State moved to revoke Phillips' deferred sentence, but the\nDistrict Court arranged for inpatient treatment in Phillips' mother's home. This program\n\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (2 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\nfailed and he was placed in a pre-release center. This, too, failed and Phillips was placed\nin the Montana State Prison (MSP) for 16 months. While at MSP, he received 15\ndisciplinary reports. He was discharged in June of 1998.\n\n\u00b68 A year later, Phillips entered guilty pleas to charges of robbery, conspiracy to commit a\nsecond robbery, theft and felony assault resulting from offenses committed only months\nafter his discharge from prison. Phillips had conspired with others to rob a Pizza Hut in\nJanuary 1999. Two other conspirators actually robbed the Pizza Hut while Phillips and\nanother person stole a pickup. After being stopped by sheriff's deputies, Phillips fired\napproximately four shots from his handgun at the officers. On August 31, 1999, the\nDistrict Court sentenced Phillips to serve a total of 50 years in MSP, with no time\nsuspended: 15 years for robbery; 15 years for conspiracy to commit robbery; 10 years for\ntheft; and 10 years for assault, all sentences to be served consecutively. Phillips replaced\nhis counsel following the entry of his guilty pleas.\n\n\u00b69 On October 13, 1999, Phillips filed a motion to correct his sentence with the trial court,\npursuant to \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA, asserting that the sentences imposed by the court were in\nerror or illegal. Phillips claimed: 1) that the District Court failed to sentence him in\naccordance with Montana's correctional and sentencing statutes; 2) that the failure to\nmaintain statutorily-required sentencing data violated his due process rights; and 3) that\nhis convictions and consecutive sentences for conspiracy to commit robbery of the\nBozeman Pizza Hut and for theft of a vehicle to be used as a getaway car violated\nprohibitions against double jeopardy found in \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, and the Montana and U.\nS. Constitutions. The District Court denied Phillips' motion and he appeals.\n\n                                                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\u00b610 1.

Montoya, \u00b6 16\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (3 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n\u00b612 Phillips concedes that the sentences imposed are within the statutory parameters for\nsentences for the offenses of which he was convicted. He argues, however, that Montana's\nsentencing and correctional policy set forth in \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA, requires the District\nCourt to sentence him commensurate with sentences imposed on others committing the\nsame offenses. The court having failed to do so, Phillips contends, his sentence is illegal.\nPhillips misstates the law.\n\n\u00b613 The Legislature has specified that the correctional and sentencing policy of this State\nis to:\n\n        (a) punish each offender commensurate with the nature and degree of harm caused\n        by the offense;\n\n        (b) protect the public by incarcerating violent offenders and serious repeat offenders;\n\n        (c) provide restitution, reparation, and restoration to the victim of the offense; and\n\n        (d) encourage and provide opportunities for the offender's self-improvement.\n\n\nSection 46-18-101(2), MCA. This policy is to be achieved pursuant to certain enumerated\nprinciples:\n\n        (a) Sentencing and punishment must be certain, timely, consistent, and\n        understandable.\n\n        (b) Sentences should be commensurate with the punishment imposed on other\n        persons committing the same offenses.\n\n        (c) Sentencing practices must be neutral with respect to the offender's race, gender,\n        religion, national origin, or social or economic status.\n\n        (d) Sentencing practices must permit judicial discretion to consider aggravating and\n        mitigating circumstances.\n\n        (e) Sentencing practices must include punishing violent and serious repeat felony\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (4 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\n        offenders with incarceration.\n\n        (f) Sentencing practices must provide alternatives to imprisonment for the\n        punishment of those nonviolent felony offenders who do not have serious criminal\n        records.\n\n        (g)Sentencing and correctional practices must emphasize that the offender is\n        responsible for obeying the law and must hold the offender accountable for the\n        offender's actions.\n\n        (h) Sentencing practices must emphasize restitution to the victim by the offender. A\n        sentence must require an offender who is financially able to do so to pay restitution,\n        costs as provided in 46-18-232, costs of court-appointed counsel as provided in 46-8-\n        113, and, if the offender is a sex offender, costs of any chemical treatment.\n\n\nSection 46-18-101(3), MCA.\n\n\u00b614 Even a casual reading of \u00a7 46-18-101(3), MCA, reflects that all but one of the\nsentencing principles are mandatory; that is, they \"must\" be followed by the sentencing\ncourt. The only exception is the commensurate sentencing factor, which is a \"should.\"\n\"Should,\" when used in connection with an obligation or duty, is somewhat weaker than\n\"ought\" and appreciably weaker than \"must\" and \"have to.\" See Montco v.

See also Webster's New\nAmerican Dictionary 369, 480 (1995) (\"ought\" expresses obligation or advisability;\n\"should\" expresses obligation or propriety).\n\n\u00b615 The Legislature chose a word with a significantly different meaning for \u00a7 46-18-101(3)\n(b), MCA, regarding commensurate sentences, than it did for the other seven factors that\n\"must\" be considered by sentencing courts, clearly reflecting its intent to ascribe a lesser\nweight to the commensurate sentences factor. We give words their common meaning and\nmay not insert into a statute that which has been omitted. Sections 1-2-101 and 106, MCA.\n\n\u00b616 Moreover, the District Court's failure to assign the commensurate sentences factor the\nweight desired by Phillips does not equate to the court giving it no meaningful effect,\nPhillips' assertion to the contrary notwithstanding. Indeed, Phillips acknowledges, and the\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (5 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\nrecord reflects, that the District Court considered the commensurate sentences factor in\nsentencing Phillips. Finally, Phillips mistakenly argues that information regarding\ncommensurate sentences could only be gained from the sentencing data that has never\nbeen maintained under \u00a7 46-18-604, MCA, when in fact the statute establishes no such\nlink.\n\n\u00b617 Phillips next requests that this Court take judicial notice, pursuant to Rule 201, M.R.\nEvid., of certain \"facts,\" which consist of information he compiled and submitted to the\nDistrict Court post-sentencing regarding sentences imposed on others for similar crimes.\n\n\u00b618 Rule 201, M.R.Evid., addresses judicial notice of facts, and provides in pertinent part:\n\n        (b) Kinds of facts. A fact to be judicially noticed must be one not subject to\n        reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial\n        jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by\n        resort to sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned.\n\n        (c) When discretionary. A court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not.\n\n        (d) When mandatory. A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and\n        supplied with the necessary information.\n\n\u00b619 Taking judicial notice is generally the act of recognizing the existence and truth of\ncertain facts. Phillips' facts, as he refers to them, do not meet the criteria set forth in the\nstatute, if for no other reason than none of the defendants he refers to were charged\ncollectively with the same crimes as was he, nor is there any information regarding other\nstatutory factors involved in their sentencing. His interpretation of the information is, as a\nresult, subject to reasonable dispute, and is, therefore, not capable of accurate and ready\ndetermination from sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. While\nPhillips asks this Court to take judicial notice of the sentencing data he provided, we will\nnot do so for the above reasons.\n\n\u00b620 Moreover, Phillips' sentences were supported by other evidence in that the sentences\nwere consistent with Montana's correctional and sentencing statutes. Phillips contends the\ncourt refused to take notice of the sentencing information he compiled, but this very\ninformation was presented in his briefs to the courts, and the record shows the information\nregarding other participants was the subject of the sentencing court's Reasons for\n\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (6 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\nSentence, and later an extended discussion with the court regarding Phillips' motion to\ncorrect sentence. We conclude the information Phillips compiled did not meet the\nstandards set forth in Rule 201, M.R.Evid. But even if it did, the District Court did not err\nwhen it sentenced Phillips consistent with the policies and factors set forth in \u00a7 46-18-101,\nMCA, and the statutes setting forth the sentences for the specific crimes to which Phillips\npleaded guilty.\n\n\u00b621 We conclude from the record that the District Court gave all the sentencing factors\nproper consideration as required under \u00a7 46-18-102(3)(b), MCA, and sentenced Phillips to\nterms of incarceration within statutory parameters. Nothing more is required. Because the\nDistrict Court did not err in interpreting and applying Montana's correctional and\nsentencing statutes, we hold that Phillips' sentences are legal and not in error.\n\n\u00b622 Because we review sentences only for legality, and because we have determined these\nsentences are legal, further arguments relating to sentencing equity must be made to the\nSentence Review Division. See \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-901 through 905, MCA; State v.

Do the procedures used by Montana's courts in maintaining sentencing data violate\nPhillips' constitutional rights to due process under the Montana and U.S. Constitutions?\n\n\u00b624 Section 46-18-604, MCA, sets forth detailed sentencing data which must be forwarded\nto the clerk of this Court by the clerks of Montana's district courts. The clerk of this Court\nis then required to compile the reports and distribute the data to district court clerks and\nother interested parties annually. These statutory requirements have never been met.\n\n\u00b625 Phillips argues that the failures to compile and submit the statutorily required\nsentencing data to a central repository, and of the District Court to consider the data,\nviolate his federal and state constitutional rights to due process. For Phillips to prevail on\nthis argument we would have to agree with his premise under Issue 1 that the courts must\nconsider and then impose sentences consistent with this data at sentencing. We have\nrejected Phillips' arguments in that regard.\n\n\u00b626 Phillips mistakenly argues that \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA, confers a constitutional right to a\ncommensurate sentence. As we concluded in Issue 1, the commensurate sentence factor is\nbut one of eight broad sentencing factors to achieve the correctional and sentencing\npolicies set forth by the Legislature, and is singularly to be accorded the least weight of\n\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (7 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\nthe eight factors.\n\n\u00b627 In support of his argument, Phillips cites State v. Goulet (1996), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"883951\"><a href=\"/opinion/883951/state-v-goulet/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, for the premise that it is fundamentally unfair for a state to fail to afford its\ncitizens rights provided by that state's statutory laws. Goulet actually stands more for a\nvalidation by the U.S. Supreme Court of this Court's historic enforcement of Montana's\nsentencing parameters, which is what we are faced with here, and militates in favor of the\nState's position in this case. In Goulet, the defendant committed the offense of felony\nescape and pleaded guilty thereto. The sentence imposed was consistent with\nrecommendations of the probation officer and prosecutor, and within the statutory\nparameters for his crimes. The trial court took into consideration Goulet's prior record and\nlong history of contact with the legal system as a juvenile, and this Court affirmed the\nsentence imposed by the District Court. Goulet, 277 Mont. at 311-12, 921 P.2d at 1247.\nHere, Phillips committed the crimes for which he was charged and to which he pleaded\nguilty. The sentence imposed was consistent with the recommendations of the probation\nofficer and within the statutory parameters for his crimes. The District Court noted his\nprior record and long history with the legal system as a juvenile.\n\n\u00b628 Goulet is underpinned by our decision in State v.

We\nhave also stated, entirely consistent with this analysis, that Montana recognizes that due\nprocess applies to sentencing, but the defendant's liberty interest during sentencing is less\nthan that interest during trial. The process that is due, therefore, is not as great as that\nrequired by the substantive criminal charges. The defendant is entitled to reasonable notice\nand an opportunity to be heard during sentencing.\n\nState v. Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 42, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 42, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"884653\"><a href=\"/opinion/884653/state-v-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 42.\n\n\u00b630 The sentencing information at issue here relates solely to the severity of sentencing,\nand has no bearing on Phillips' actual conviction. Phillips received adequate notice and\nwas heard during sentencing. Moreover, under \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA, the sentencing\ninformation at issue here is to be assigned the least weight of all sentencing factors. The\nstatute in no way implies or states that the only possible source for commensurate sentence\ninformation is the information called for under \u00a7 46-18-604, MCA. The court referenced\nits familiarity with the sentences imposed on others perpetrating these crimes and did not\nerr in the way it did so. The court stated in its Order:\n\n        The undersigned judge, having presided over criminal sentencings for almost 17\n        years, has both recollections of sentencing other defendants in Gallatin County and a\n        strong sense of the type and length of sentences meted out against other defendants\n        in the state of Montana. . . . [T]he court considered in this case, among other factors,\n        the length of sentence to be imposed on defendant. . . . The availability of statewide\n        sentencing statistics would not have changed the court's reasons for sentencing this\n        defendant.\n\nThe lack of the sentencing information called for under \u00a7 46-18-604, MCA, does not\nimplicate Phillips' constitutional rights to due process as he asserts. As a result, we\nconclude that the procedures used by Montana's courts in maintaining sentencing data do\nnot violate Phillips' constitutional rights to due process under either the Montana or U.S.\nConstitutions.\n\n\u00b631 Moreover, Phillips has failed to demonstrate that any prejudice resulted from the fact\nthat the State has not compiled sentencing data under \u00a7 46-18-604, MCA. Again, the trial\ncourt specifically noted that additional data regarding sentences imposed on others around\nthe State would not have affected in any way the sentences earned by Phillips for his\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (9 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\ncrimes, for which he entered voluntary and intelligent pleas of guilty, and which fall\nwithin statutory parameters. The court properly reviewed the requisite sentencing factors\nand properly exercised its statutory discretion.\n\n\u00b632 Finally, the record does not reflect that Phillips requested the information required by\n\u00a7 46-18-604, MCA, at the time of his original sentencing, but rather that he raised the\nissue for the first time when he challenged the correctness and legality of his sentence\nunder \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA. Arguably, and notwithstanding that we have addressed Phillips'\narguments, he has not even properly preserved this issue for appellate review.\n\n\u00b633 We conclude that Phillips' constitutional rights to due process under the Montana and\nU.S. Constitutions have not been violated by the manner in which the State maintains\nsentencing data.\n\n\u00b634. Do Phillips' convictions and sentences for conspiracy and theft violate Montana\nstatutes and the Montana and U.S. Constitutions?\n\n\u00b635 Phillips contends that his convictions and sentences for conspiracy and theft violate \u00a7\n46-11-410(2), MCA, which prohibits convictions of more than one offense under certain\ncircumstances. He also contends that his convictions violate the double jeopardy\nprovisions of both the Montana and U.S. Constitutions.\n\n\u00b636 Phillips argues that his claims that his convictions and sentences for the crimes of\nconspiracy and theft violate provisions of the state and federal constitutions, and \u00a7 46-11-\n410(2)(b), MCA, were not waived because they raise jurisdictional defects or defenses\nwhich could be determined from the face of the record before the court. Phillips does not\nclearly articulate the jurisdictional defects or defenses he claims are present, and only\nraises this issue for the first time in his reply brief to this Court. However, since the\ndefects would be obvious from the record, we will address his claims.\n\n\u00b637 The core of Phillips' argument is that he was sentenced once for the theft of the pickup\nwhen he was sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery of the pizza parlor and a second\ntime for the same theft when he was sentenced on his conviction for the substantive\noffense of theft of the pickup. His argument as a whole is circular and would lead to\nabsurd results. Under his reasoning, had he committed murder while stealing the pickup,\nas he nearly did when he shot at the deputies in pursuit of him, he would be immune from\nprosecution for the murder as it was merely an act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (10 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\n\u00b638 The conspiracy to commit the robbery and the theft were two separate criminal acts.\nThe conspiracy charge did not stem from a conspiracy to steal the pickup. The conspiracy\ncharge stemmed from the conspiracy to rob the pizza parlor. That the theft of the pickup\nwas listed as one of ten overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy does not negate the\nimport of the other nine acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, nor does it somehow convert\nthe substantive offense of the pickup theft into a legally inconsequential act as argued by\nPhillips. Phillips and another individual stole the truck without the knowledge of the\nrobbery actually occurring at the Pizza Hut. Two other individuals completed the robbery\nwithout the benefit of the stolen get-away vehicle. The fact that there was an agreement to\nsteal a vehicle to effectuate a successful escape from the robbery does not mean that\nPhillips cannot be held accountable for this separate conduct. More importantly, Phillips\nwas convicted of the conspiracy to commit robbery of the Pizza Hut, not the robbery itself.\nThe District Court correctly concluded that \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, was not violated\nbecause the conspiracy to rob the Pizza Hut was not a form of preparation to commit theft\nof the pickup.\n\n\u00b639 Phillips also argues that his convictions and sentences for conspiracy and theft violate\nthe double jeopardy provisions of both the Montana and U.S. Constitutions. To that end,\nPhillips correctly points out that Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution\nprotects persons from multiple prosecutions for offenses arising out of the same\ntransaction and multiple punishments imposed at a single prosecution for the same\noffense. See State v. Guillaume, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"885141\"><a href=\"/opinion/885141/state-v-guillaume/\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 8, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 8, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"885141\"><a href=\"/opinion/885141/state-v-guillaume/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 8\n(citations omitted). However, Phillips incorrectly claims that his convictions for\nconspiracy and theft constitute multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\n\u00b640 Phillips claims that he was made to suffer twice for the single act of the theft of the\npickup and he relies on Guillaume for his contention that this was a violation of the double\njeopardy provision. Guillaume, however, does not lend support to Phillips' argument. We\nheld in Guillaume that the application of a weapon enhancement statute to a felony\nconviction where the underlying offense required proof of the use of a weapon violated the\ndouble jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.\nGuillaume, \u00b6 16. We noted in Guillaume that the only fact which raised Guillaume's\ncharge from a misdemeanor assault to a felony assault was the use of a weapon. Thus,\nwhen the weapon enhancement statute was applied to Guillaume's felony assault\nconviction, he was subjected to double punishment for the use of a weapon: once when the\ncharge was elevated from misdemeanor assault to felony assault, and again when the\nweapon enhancement statute was applied. Guillaume, \u00b6 18.\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (11 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\n\u00b641 In the case sub judice, the District Court correctly concluded that the offense of theft\nand the offense of conspiracy to commit robbery have distinct elements which require\nproof of a fact that the other does not. To convict Phillips of conspiracy, the State had to\nprove that Phillips, with the purpose that an offense be committed, agreed with another to\nthe commission of that offense and either Phillips or his co-conspirator completed an act\nin furtherance of that offense. Section 45-4-102, MCA. To convict Phillips of theft, the\nState had to prove that Phillips obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the property\nof another. Section 45-6-301, MCA. Hence, as the District Court noted, Phillips' conduct\nin committing conspiracy went beyond the one act of stealing the pickup and he could be\nconvicted of the conspiracy without considering the act of stealing the pickup. Likewise,\nstealing the pickup was a separate and completed act which did not require proof of any\nagreement between Phillips and others.\n\n\u00b642 Accordingly, we hold that Phillips' convictions and sentences for conspiracy and theft\ndo not violate \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, and the double jeopardy provisions of the Montana\nand U.S. Constitutions.\n\n\u00b643 Affirmed.\n\n\n                                                         /S/ JAMES C.

The District Court deferred sentencing\nPhillips on condition he participate successfully in a community-based alternative, which\nprovided housing and mentoring to Phillips. Within a year, he was involved in a physical\naltercation, provided a BB gun for use in a robbery, and failed to complete his chemical\ndependency regimen. The State moved to revoke Phillips' deferred sentence, but the\nDistrict Court arranged for inpatient treatment in Phillips' mother's home. This program\n\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (2 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\nfailed and he was placed in a pre-release center. This, too, failed and Phillips was placed\nin the Montana State Prison (MSP) for 16 months. While at MSP, he received 15\ndisciplinary reports. He was discharged in June of 1998.\n\n\u00b68 A year later, Phillips entered guilty pleas to charges of robbery, conspiracy to commit a\nsecond robbery, theft and felony assault resulting from offenses committed only months\nafter his discharge from prison. Phillips had conspired with others to rob a Pizza Hut in\nJanuary 1999. Two other conspirators actually robbed the Pizza Hut while Phillips and\nanother person stole a pickup. After being stopped by sheriff's deputies, Phillips fired\napproximately four shots from his handgun at the officers. On August 31, 1999, the\nDistrict Court sentenced Phillips to serve a total of 50 years in MSP, with no time\nsuspended: 15 years for robbery; 15 years for conspiracy to commit robbery; 10 years for\ntheft; and 10 years for assault, all sentences to be served consecutively. Phillips replaced\nhis counsel following the entry of his guilty pleas.\n\n\u00b69 On October 13, 1999, Phillips filed a motion to correct his sentence with the trial court,\npursuant to \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA, asserting that the sentences imposed by the court were in\nerror or illegal. Phillips claimed: 1) that the District Court failed to sentence him in\naccordance with Montana's correctional and sentencing statutes; 2) that the failure to\nmaintain statutorily-required sentencing data violated his due process rights; and 3) that\nhis convictions and consecutive sentences for conspiracy to commit robbery of the\nBozeman Pizza Hut and for theft of a vehicle to be used as a getaway car violated\nprohibitions against double jeopardy found in \u00a7 46-11-410, MCA, and the Montana and U.\nS. Constitutions. The District Court denied Phillips' motion and he appeals.\n\n                                                                      DISCUSSION\n\n\u00b610 1. Is Phillips' sentence illegal because the District Court erred in interpreting and\napplying Montana's correctional and sentencing statutes?\n\n\n\u00b611 We review a criminal sentence only for legality.

He argues, however, that Montana's\nsentencing and correctional policy set forth in \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA, requires the District\nCourt to sentence him commensurate with sentences imposed on others committing the\nsame offenses. The court having failed to do so, Phillips contends, his sentence is illegal.\nPhillips misstates the law.\n\n\u00b613 The Legislature has specified that the correctional and sentencing policy of this State\nis to:\n\n        (a) punish each offender commensurate with the nature and degree of harm caused\n        by the offense;\n\n        (b) protect the public by incarcerating violent offenders and serious repeat offenders;\n\n        (c) provide restitution, reparation, and restoration to the victim of the offense; and\n\n        (d) encourage and provide opportunities for the offender's self-improvement.\n\n\nSection 46-18-101(2), MCA. This policy is to be achieved pursuant to certain enumerated\nprinciples:\n\n        (a) Sentencing and punishment must be certain, timely, consistent, and\n        understandable.\n\n        (b) Sentences should be commensurate with the punishment imposed on other\n        persons committing the same offenses.\n\n        (c) Sentencing practices must be neutral with respect to the offender's race, gender,\n        religion, national origin, or social or economic status.\n\n        (d) Sentencing practices must permit judicial discretion to consider aggravating and\n        mitigating circumstances.\n\n        (e) Sentencing practices must include punishing violent and serious repeat felony\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (4 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\n        offenders with incarceration.\n\n        (f) Sentencing practices must provide alternatives to imprisonment for the\n        punishment of those nonviolent felony offenders who do not have serious criminal\n        records.\n\n        (g)Sentencing and correctional practices must emphasize that the offender is\n        responsible for obeying the law and must hold the offender accountable for the\n        offender's actions.\n\n        (h) Sentencing practices must emphasize restitution to the victim by the offender. A\n        sentence must require an offender who is financially able to do so to pay restitution,\n        costs as provided in 46-18-232, costs of court-appointed counsel as provided in 46-8-\n        113, and, if the offender is a sex offender, costs of any chemical treatment.\n\n\nSection 46-18-101(3), MCA.\n\n\u00b614 Even a casual reading of \u00a7 46-18-101(3), MCA, reflects that all but one of the\nsentencing principles are mandatory; that is, they \"must\" be followed by the sentencing\ncourt. The only exception is the commensurate sentencing factor, which is a \"should.\"\n\"Should,\" when used in connection with an obligation or duty, is somewhat weaker than\n\"ought\" and appreciably weaker than \"must\" and \"have to.\" See Montco v. Simonich\n(1997), 285 Mont. 280, 287, 947 P.2d 1047, 1051 (for purposes of statutory construction,\nboth \"shall\" and \"must\" are mandatory); State v. Bartlett (1995), 271 Mont. 429, 432-33,\n898 P.2d 98, 100 (the word \"shall\" in a statute is compulsory). See also Webster's New\nAmerican Dictionary 369, 480 (1995) (\"ought\" expresses obligation or advisability;\n\"should\" expresses obligation or propriety).\n\n\u00b615 The Legislature chose a word with a significantly different meaning for \u00a7 46-18-101(3)\n(b), MCA, regarding commensurate sentences, than it did for the other seven factors that\n\"must\" be considered by sentencing courts, clearly reflecting its intent to ascribe a lesser\nweight to the commensurate sentences factor. We give words their common meaning and\nmay not insert into a statute that which has been omitted. Sections 1-2-101 and 106, MCA.\n\n\u00b616 Moreover, the District Court's failure to assign the commensurate sentences factor the\nweight desired by Phillips does not equate to the court giving it no meaningful effect,\nPhillips' assertion to the contrary notwithstanding. Indeed, Phillips acknowledges, and the\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (5 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\nrecord reflects, that the District Court considered the commensurate sentences factor in\nsentencing Phillips. Finally, Phillips mistakenly argues that information regarding\ncommensurate sentences could only be gained from the sentencing data that has never\nbeen maintained under \u00a7 46-18-604, MCA, when in fact the statute establishes no such\nlink.\n\n\u00b617 Phillips next requests that this Court take judicial notice, pursuant to Rule 201, M.R.\nEvid., of certain \"facts,\" which consist of information he compiled and submitted to the\nDistrict Court post-sentencing regarding sentences imposed on others for similar crimes.\n\n\u00b618 Rule 201, M.R.Evid., addresses judicial notice of facts, and provides in pertinent part:\n\n        (b) Kinds of facts. A fact to be judicially noticed must be one not subject to\n        reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial\n        jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by\n        resort to sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned.\n\n        (c) When discretionary. A court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not.\n\n        (d) When mandatory. A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a party and\n        supplied with the necessary information.\n\n\u00b619 Taking judicial notice is generally the act of recognizing the existence and truth of\ncertain facts. Phillips' facts, as he refers to them, do not meet the criteria set forth in the\nstatute, if for no other reason than none of the defendants he refers to were charged\ncollectively with the same crimes as was he, nor is there any information regarding other\nstatutory factors involved in their sentencing. His interpretation of the information is, as a\nresult, subject to reasonable dispute, and is, therefore, not capable of accurate and ready\ndetermination from sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. While\nPhillips asks this Court to take judicial notice of the sentencing data he provided, we will\nnot do so for the above reasons.\n\n\u00b620 Moreover, Phillips' sentences were supported by other evidence in that the sentences\nwere consistent with Montana's correctional and sentencing statutes. Phillips contends the\ncourt refused to take notice of the sentencing information he compiled, but this very\ninformation was presented in his briefs to the courts, and the record shows the information\nregarding other participants was the subject of the sentencing court's Reasons for\n\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (6 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\nSentence, and later an extended discussion with the court regarding Phillips' motion to\ncorrect sentence. We conclude the information Phillips compiled did not meet the\nstandards set forth in Rule 201, M.R.Evid. But even if it did, the District Court did not err\nwhen it sentenced Phillips consistent with the policies and factors set forth in \u00a7 46-18-101,\nMCA, and the statutes setting forth the sentences for the specific crimes to which Phillips\npleaded guilty.\n\n\u00b621 We conclude from the record that the District Court gave all the sentencing factors\nproper consideration as required under \u00a7 46-18-102(3)(b), MCA, and sentenced Phillips to\nterms of incarceration within statutory parameters. Nothing more is required. Because the\nDistrict Court did not err in interpreting and applying Montana's correctional and\nsentencing statutes, we hold that Phillips' sentences are legal and not in error.\n\n\u00b622 Because we review sentences only for legality, and because we have determined these\nsentences are legal, further arguments relating to sentencing equity must be made to the\nSentence Review Division. See \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-901 through 905, MCA; State v. Montoya, 1999\nMT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15.\n\n\u00b623 2. Do the procedures used by Montana's courts in maintaining sentencing data violate\nPhillips' constitutional rights to due process under the Montana and U.S. Constitutions?\n\n\u00b624 Section 46-18-604, MCA, sets forth detailed sentencing data which must be forwarded\nto the clerk of this Court by the clerks of Montana's district courts. The clerk of this Court\nis then required to compile the reports and distribute the data to district court clerks and\nother interested parties annually. These statutory requirements have never been met.\n\n\u00b625 Phillips argues that the failures to compile and submit the statutorily required\nsentencing data to a central repository, and of the District Court to consider the data,\nviolate his federal and state constitutional rights to due process. For Phillips to prevail on\nthis argument we would have to agree with his premise under Issue 1 that the courts must\nconsider and then impose sentences consistent with this data at sentencing. We have\nrejected Phillips' arguments in that regard.\n\n\u00b626 Phillips mistakenly argues that \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA, confers a constitutional right to a\ncommensurate sentence. As we concluded in Issue 1, the commensurate sentence factor is\nbut one of eight broad sentencing factors to achieve the correctional and sentencing\npolicies set forth by the Legislature, and is singularly to be accorded the least weight of\n\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (7 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\nthe eight factors.\n\n\u00b627 In support of his argument, Phillips cites State v. Goulet (1996), 277 Mont. 308, 921\nP.2d 1245, for the premise that it is fundamentally unfair for a state to fail to afford its\ncitizens rights provided by that state's statutory laws. Goulet actually stands more for a\nvalidation by the U.S. Supreme Court of this Court's historic enforcement of Montana's\nsentencing parameters, which is what we are faced with here, and militates in favor of the\nState's position in this case. In Goulet, the defendant committed the offense of felony\nescape and pleaded guilty thereto. The sentence imposed was consistent with\nrecommendations of the probation officer and prosecutor, and within the statutory\nparameters for his crimes. The trial court took into consideration Goulet's prior record and\nlong history of contact with the legal system as a juvenile, and this Court affirmed the\nsentence imposed by the District Court. Goulet, 277 Mont. at 311-12, 921 P.2d at 1247.\nHere, Phillips committed the crimes for which he was charged and to which he pleaded\nguilty. The sentence imposed was consistent with the recommendations of the probation\nofficer and within the statutory parameters for his crimes. The District Court noted his\nprior record and long history with the legal system as a juvenile.\n\n\u00b628 Goulet is underpinned by our decision in State v. Krantz (1990), 241 Mont. 501, 788\nP.2d 298, cert. denied by Krantz v. Montana (1990), 498 U.S. 938, 111 S.Ct. 341, 112 L.\nEd.2d 306. In Krantz, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari to review this\nCourt's application of federal and Montana constitutional due process analysis. In that\ncase, we adopted the rule that the State need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt every\nfact, the existence or nonexistence of which it is willing to recognize as an exculpatory or\nmitigating circumstance affecting the degree of culpability or the severity of punishment.\nKrantz, 241 Mont. at 508-10, 788 P.2d at 302-04 (citing McMillan v. Pennsylvania (1986),\n477 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 91 L.Ed.2d 67) (emphasis added). While various aspects of\nMcMillan have since been refined, this principle has not been modified. It has most\nrecently been reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court when it denied certiorari in United\nStates v. Segien (1997), 114 F.3d 1014, cert. denied by Segien v. United States (1998), 523\nU.S. 1024, 118 S.Ct. 1310, 140 L.Ed.2d 474. The Segien court also noted that \"the Due\nProcess Clause protects [criminal defendants] against conviction except upon proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is\ncharged.\" In re Winship (1970), 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed. 2d 368\n(emphasis added). \"However, facts impacting the severity of a sentence need not be\nproven beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\" Patterson v. New York (1977), 432 U.S. 197, 210,\n214 & n.15, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 2327, 2329 & n.15, 53 L.Ed.2d 281.\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (8 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\n\n\u00b629 The unwillingness of the U.S. Supreme Court to deem sentencing information worthy\nof the level of due process protection Phillips requests is consistent with our own. We\nhave also stated, entirely consistent with this analysis, that Montana recognizes that due\nprocess applies to sentencing, but the defendant's liberty interest during sentencing is less\nthan that interest during trial. The process that is due, therefore, is not as great as that\nrequired by the substantive criminal charges. The defendant is entitled to reasonable notice\nand an opportunity to be heard during sentencing.\n\nState v. Miller, 1998 MT 177, \u00b6 42, 290 Mont. 97, \u00b6 42, 966 P.2d 721, \u00b6 42.\n\n\u00b630 The sentencing information at issue here relates solely to the severity of sentencing,\nand has no bearing on Phillips' actual conviction. Phillips received adequate notice and\nwas heard during sentencing. Moreover, under \u00a7 46-18-101, MCA, the sentencing\ninformation at issue here is to be assigned the least weight of all sentencing factors. The\nstatute in no way implies or states that the only possible source for commensurate sentence\ninformation is the information called for under \u00a7 46-18-604, MCA. The court referenced\nits familiarity with the sentences imposed on others perpetrating these crimes and did not\nerr in the way it did so. The court stated in its Order:\n\n        The undersigned judge, having presided over criminal sentencings for almost 17\n        years, has both recollections of sentencing other defendants in Gallatin County and a\n        strong sense of the type and length of sentences meted out against other defendants\n        in the state of Montana. . . . [T]he court considered in this case, among other factors,\n        the length of sentence to be imposed on defendant. . . . The availability of statewide\n        sentencing statistics would not have changed the court's reasons for sentencing this\n        defendant.\n\nThe lack of the sentencing information called for under \u00a7 46-18-604, MCA, does not\nimplicate Phillips' constitutional rights to due process as he asserts. As a result, we\nconclude that the procedures used by Montana's courts in maintaining sentencing data do\nnot violate Phillips' constitutional rights to due process under either the Montana or U.S.\nConstitutions.\n\n\u00b631 Moreover, Phillips has failed to demonstrate that any prejudice resulted from the fact\nthat the State has not compiled sentencing data under \u00a7 46-18-604, MCA. Again, the trial\ncourt specifically noted that additional data regarding sentences imposed on others around\nthe State would not have affected in any way the sentences earned by Phillips for his\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (9 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\ncrimes, for which he entered voluntary and intelligent pleas of guilty, and which fall\nwithin statutory parameters. The court properly reviewed the requisite sentencing factors\nand properly exercised its statutory discretion.\n\n\u00b632 Finally, the record does not reflect that Phillips requested the information required by\n\u00a7 46-18-604, MCA, at the time of his original sentencing, but rather that he raised the\nissue for the first time when he challenged the correctness and legality of his sentence\nunder \u00a7 46-18-117, MCA. Arguably, and notwithstanding that we have addressed Phillips'\narguments, he has not even properly preserved this issue for appellate review.\n\n\u00b633 We conclude that Phillips' constitutional rights to due process under the Montana and\nU.S. Constitutions have not been violated by the manner in which the State maintains\nsentencing data.\n\n\u00b634. Do Phillips' convictions and sentences for conspiracy and theft violate Montana\nstatutes and the Montana and U.S. Constitutions?\n\n\u00b635 Phillips contends that his convictions and sentences for conspiracy and theft violate \u00a7\n46-11-410(2), MCA, which prohibits convictions of more than one offense under certain\ncircumstances. He also contends that his convictions violate the double jeopardy\nprovisions of both the Montana and U.S. Constitutions.\n\n\u00b636 Phillips argues that his claims that his convictions and sentences for the crimes of\nconspiracy and theft violate provisions of the state and federal constitutions, and \u00a7 46-11-\n410(2)(b), MCA, were not waived because they raise jurisdictional defects or defenses\nwhich could be determined from the face of the record before the court. Phillips does not\nclearly articulate the jurisdictional defects or defenses he claims are present, and only\nraises this issue for the first time in his reply brief to this Court. However, since the\ndefects would be obvious from the record, we will address his claims.\n\n\u00b637 The core of Phillips' argument is that he was sentenced once for the theft of the pickup\nwhen he was sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery of the pizza parlor and a second\ntime for the same theft when he was sentenced on his conviction for the substantive\noffense of theft of the pickup. His argument as a whole is circular and would lead to\nabsurd results. Under his reasoning, had he committed murder while stealing the pickup,\nas he nearly did when he shot at the deputies in pursuit of him, he would be immune from\nprosecution for the murder as it was merely an act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (10 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\n\u00b638 The conspiracy to commit the robbery and the theft were two separate criminal acts.\nThe conspiracy charge did not stem from a conspiracy to steal the pickup. The conspiracy\ncharge stemmed from the conspiracy to rob the pizza parlor. That the theft of the pickup\nwas listed as one of ten overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy does not negate the\nimport of the other nine acts in furtherance of the conspiracy, nor does it somehow convert\nthe substantive offense of the pickup theft into a legally inconsequential act as argued by\nPhillips. Phillips and another individual stole the truck without the knowledge of the\nrobbery actually occurring at the Pizza Hut. Two other individuals completed the robbery\nwithout the benefit of the stolen get-away vehicle. The fact that there was an agreement to\nsteal a vehicle to effectuate a successful escape from the robbery does not mean that\nPhillips cannot be held accountable for this separate conduct. More importantly, Phillips\nwas convicted of the conspiracy to commit robbery of the Pizza Hut, not the robbery itself.\nThe District Court correctly concluded that \u00a7 46-11-410(2), MCA, was not violated\nbecause the conspiracy to rob the Pizza Hut was not a form of preparation to commit theft\nof the pickup.\n\n\u00b639 Phillips also argues that his convictions and sentences for conspiracy and theft violate\nthe double jeopardy provisions of both the Montana and U.S. Constitutions. To that end,\nPhillips correctly points out that Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution\nprotects persons from multiple prosecutions for offenses arising out of the same\ntransaction and multiple punishments imposed at a single prosecution for the same\noffense. See State v. Guillaume, 1999 MT 29, \u00b6 8, 293 Mont. 224, \u00b6 8, 975 P.2d 312, \u00b6 8\n(citations omitted). However, Phillips incorrectly claims that his convictions for\nconspiracy and theft constitute multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\n\u00b640 Phillips claims that he was made to suffer twice for the single act of the theft of the\npickup and he relies on Guillaume for his contention that this was a violation of the double\njeopardy provision. Guillaume, however, does not lend support to Phillips' argument. We\nheld in Guillaume that the application of a weapon enhancement statute to a felony\nconviction where the underlying offense required proof of the use of a weapon violated the\ndouble jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution.\nGuillaume, \u00b6 16. We noted in Guillaume that the only fact which raised Guillaume's\ncharge from a misdemeanor assault to a felony assault was the use of a weapon. Thus,\nwhen the weapon enhancement statute was applied to Guillaume's felony assault\nconviction, he was subjected to double punishment for the use of a weapon: once when the\ncharge was elevated from misdemeanor assault to felony assault, and again when the\nweapon enhancement statute was applied. Guillaume, \u00b6 18.\n\n file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm (11 of 12)1/19/2007 10:48:31 AM\n\f file:///C|/Documents%20and%20Settings/cu1046/Desktop/opinions/00-001%20Opinion.htm\n\n\n\u00b641 In the case sub judice, the District Court correctly concluded that the offense of theft\nand the offense of conspiracy to commit robbery have distinct elements which require\nproof of a fact that the other does not. To convict Phillips of conspiracy, the State had to\nprove that Phillips, with the purpose that an offense be committed, agreed with another to\nthe commission of that offense and either Phillips or his co-conspirator completed an act\nin furtherance of that offense. Section 45-4-102, MCA. To convict Phillips of theft, the\nState had to prove that Phillips obtained or exerted unauthorized control over the property\nof another. Section 45-6-301, MCA. Hence, as the District Court noted, Phillips' conduct\nin committing conspiracy went beyond the one act of stealing the pickup and he could be\nconvicted of the conspiracy without considering the act of stealing the pickup.
