The respondent Carol B., the maternal\ngrandmother of the minor children at issue in this mat-\nter (grandmother), appeals from the judgments of the\ntrial court removing her as guardian and custodian of\nthe children, Jaccari J. and Justin J., and ordering that\ncustody and guardianship be vested in the children\u2019s\nfather, the respondent Angel J.1 On appeal, the grand-\nmother claims that, after the court adjudicated the chil-\ndren neglected, it improperly employed a rebuttable\npresumption in favor of the children\u2019s father when\ndetermining in whom to vest custody and guardianship\nof the children, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129\n(j) (2), and that the use of the rebuttable presumption\nwas harmful. We conclude that the court\u2019s use of a\nrebuttable presumption in favor of the children\u2019s father\nduring the dispositional phase of the neglect proceed-\nings was improper. That error notwithstanding, how-\never, we further conclude, on the basis of the trial\ncourt\u2019s extensive uncontested factual findings and thor-\nough best interest analysis, that the grandmother has\nfailed to demonstrate that she was harmed by the\ncourt\u2019s use of a rebuttable presumption in this case.\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.2\n   On April 25, 2005, the Probate Court awarded custody\nand guardianship of the children to the grandmother.3\nOn June 19, 2013, the petitioner, the Commissioner of\nChildren and Families, filed a neglect petition on behalf\nof the children. After the trial on the neglect petition,\nthe court found that, while living with the grandmother,\nthe children had \u2018\u2018been denied proper care and atten-\ntion, physically, educationally, emotionally, or morally,\nand [had] been permitted to live under conditions, cir-\ncumstances, or associations injurious to their well-\nbeing.\u2019\u2019 In its decision, the court noted that the children\nhave several medical and behavioral issues. They need\ndaily medication, and they lack exercise and healthy\neating habits.4 Appointments with doctors, nutritionists,\ntherapists and counselors were made for them but were\nnot attended, and previous therapy and medical provid-\ners discharged the children due to missed\nappointments.\n   During its analysis of the dispositional phase of the\ntrial, the court engaged in a thorough examination of\nand comparison between placing the children with the\ngrandmother and placing them with their father.5 With\nrespect to the grandmother, the court made the follow-\ning relevant findings. The children had resided with the\ngrandmother since they were infants, but her apartment\nis small. The grandmother and her brother, who also\nlives in the small apartment, had smoked in the home\ndespite the presence of the children and an oxygen\ntank. The grandmother suffers from medical conditions\nthat limit her mobility; she is disabled. Her medical\nconditions previously have caused her to be hospital-\n\fized, and have caused her to miss, cancel, reschedule\nor be unable to schedule medical and counseling\nappointments for the children. Those conditions also\nhamper her ability to insure that the children get proper\nmedical care and therapy. She also has no means of\ntransportation. For months prior to trial, she refused\nto allow the employees of the Department of Children\nand Families to enter her home, and the trial court\nstated that it was not sure whether the children were\nresiding there; Jaccari J. reported to a therapist that he\nand his brother were residing, instead, with their great\naunt, who lives in the same apartment building as the\ngrandmother. The grandmother is strict with the chil-\ndren and has struggled with the parenting style recom-\nmended by therapists. The grandmother loves the\nchildren and has tried to do the best that she can for\nthem.\n   With respect to the children\u2019s father, Angel J., the\ncourt found that he has been arrested and jailed pre-\nviously; his criminal record includes felonies from the\n1980s and 1990s. He does work at his father\u2019s church\nand runs errands for his father. His father, a reverend\nat the church, allows Angel J., in exchange for the work\nhe does, to live rent free in a two-family home owned\nby the church. The home is large enough for each child\nto have his own room. Angel J.\u2019s father also gives him\nmoney for the care of the children and for food. Angel\nJ. has access to a car, and he transports the children\nto and from school each day. He also is available to\ntake the children to their various medical and therapy\nappointments. He always has been a part of the chil-\ndren\u2019s lives and attends church with them on Sundays,\nbut has a hard time saying \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 to them and would\nbring them to McDonald\u2019s after school. The court found,\nhowever, that Angel J. now understands that the chil-\ndren need to be on a strict diet. Angel J. loves the\nchildren.\n   Significantly, the court found that the children\u2019s\nfather could best tailor the food intake of the children\nand regulate their meals. The children were more open\nand acted differently when attending therapy sessions\nwith their father. The court also found that the father\ncould better follow the recommendations of the thera-\npists in addressing the behavioral issues of the children\nat home.\n   Ultimately, the court concluded that the children had\n\u2018\u2018a long-term continuous relationship with their biologi-\ncal parent, the father. [The grandmother] has been\nunable to provide for the boys\u2019 medical and therapy\nneeds and follow through with the recommendations\nof the therapists on a consistent basis. Their housing\nis now in question as to the condition of the apartment,\nthe boys\u2019 accommodations in the apartment and\nwhether the boys actually reside in that apartment. The\nfather has his own first floor unit with plenty of room\n\ffor the boys. He has transportation to take them to\nschool and to all their medical and therapy appoint-\nments. He has the flexibility with his schedule to accom-\nmodate their needs. He is their natural parent. There\nis a presumption that the boys should be with a natural\nparent. The court knows that presumption is rebuttable\nbut, in light of all the above, there has been insufficient\nevidence presented to rebut the presumption.\u2019\u2019\n   The court went on to find, by a fair preponderance\nof the evidence, that \u2018\u2018it is in the best interest of both\n[children] that guardianship and custody be transferred\nto their father, Angel J., and that there be a period of\nprotective supervision for [six] months; that Angel J.\nsign specific steps to ensure the boys\u2019 medical and\ntherapeutic needs are met; that he conform their diet\nto the recommendations of their doctors and the nutri-\ntionist; and that he allow [the grandmother] visitation\nwith the boys.\u2019\u20196 Thereafter, the grandmother filed the\npresent appeal.\n   The petitioner filed motions for articulation\nrequesting that the court articulate whether it had\nfound, on the basis of the evidence, that the children\u2019s\nfather was suitable and worthy to care for each of the\nchildren. The grandmother offered no objection to the\npetitioner\u2019s motions, and the court responded by filing\nan articulation related to each of the children, setting\nforth the same findings in each articulation:\n  \u2018\u2018The court finds that Angel J., the biological father\nof [the children] is suitable and worthy. This is based\non the record and findings stated in the court\u2019s decision,\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n  \u2018\u20181. The father has had a loving, active and continuous\nrelationship with [the children] since [they were] young.\nHe was transporting [them] to school every day and to\nmedical and therapy appointments when allowed. He\nhad weekend visitations with [the children].\n  \u2018\u20182. He has a motor vehicle to take [the children]\nto [their] medical, therapy and specialist appointments\nthat are necessary to address [their] specialized needs.\n  \u2018\u20183. The father resides on the first floor of a house\nthat has ample room for [the children]. They each have\ntheir own room.\n  \u2018\u20184. The father has the time necessary to take [the\nchildren] to all [their] required appointments.\n  \u2018\u20185. The father can prepare and supervise [the chil-\ndren\u2019s] dietary needs.\u2019\u2019\n  On appeal, the grandmother does not contest the\ncourt\u2019s finding of neglect or any of the extensive find-\nings supporting the court\u2019s disposition in this case; she\nargues only that, after adjudicating the children\nneglected, the court improperly used a rebuttable pre-\nsumption in favor of the children\u2019s father, and that this\nwas harmful because the result of the proceedings may\n\fhave been different had the presumption not been\nemployed.7 Under the uncontested facts of this case,\nwhich the court set forth in specific detail in its memo-\nrandum of decision, we conclude that, although the\nuse of the rebuttable presumption was improper, the\ngrandmother has failed to demonstrate that the error\nwas harmful.\n   Here, the grandmother contends that, although there\nis no rebuttable presumption found in \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2),\nwhich applies in this case, the court improperly used\na presumption in favor of the parent when it was\ndetermining in whom to vest custody and guardianship\nof the children. We agree.\n   \u2018\u2018When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objec-\ntive is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent\nof the legislature. . . . In other words, we seek to\ndetermine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the\nstatutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case,\nincluding the question of whether the language actually\ndoes apply. . . . In seeking to determine that meaning,\nGeneral Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the\ntext of the statute itself and its relationship to other\nstatutes. If, after examining such text and considering\nsuch relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and\nunambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable\nresults, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the\nstatute shall not be considered.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.) In re Elvin G., 310 Conn. 485, 499\u2013500,\n78 A.3d 797 (2013).\n   The parties agree that, after the court adjudicated the\nchildren neglected in this case, the decision to transfer\ncustody and guardianship was governed by \u00a7 46b-129\n(j) (2), which provides: \u2018\u2018Upon finding and adjudging\nthat any child or youth is uncared-for, neglected or\nabused the court may (A) commit such child or youth\nto the Commissioner of Children and Families, and such\ncommitment shall remain in effect until further order\nof the court, except that such commitment may be\nrevoked or parental rights terminated at any time by\nthe court; (B) vest such child\u2019s or youth\u2019s legal guardian-\nship in any private or public agency that is permitted\nby law to care for neglected, uncared-for or abused\nchildren or youths or with any other person or persons\nfound to be suitable and worthy of such responsibility\nby the court, including, but not limited to, any relative\nof such child or youth by blood or marriage; (C) vest\nsuch child\u2019s or youth\u2019s permanent legal guardianship in\nany person or persons found to be suitable and worthy\nof such responsibility by the court, including, but not\nlimited to, any relative of such child or youth by blood\nor marriage in accordance with the requirements set\nforth in subdivision (5) of this subsection; or (D) place\nthe child or youth in the custody of the parent or guard-\nian with protective supervision by the Commissioner\nof Children and Families subject to conditions estab-\n\flished by the court.\u2019\u2019\n   Unlike General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56b, which provides\nthat \u2018\u2018[i]n any dispute as to the custody of a minor child\ninvolving a parent and a nonparent, there shall be a\npresumption that it is in the best interest of the child\nto be in the custody of the parent, which presumption\nmay be rebutted by showing that it would be detrimental\nto the child to permit the parent to have custody,\u2019\u2019 \u00a7 46b-\n129 (j) (2) contains no presumption in favor of a parent.\nIt is clear that \u00a7 46b-56b does not apply to this proceed-\ning, and all parties concede this. See also footnotes 6\nand 7 of this opinion. The parties also agree that the\ncourt\u2019s use of the presumption in this case was error,\nand, on the basis of the plain language of \u00a7 46b-129 (j)\n(2), we agree. We have found no applicable case law that\nwould lead us to a different conclusion. Accordingly, we\nconclude that the court improperly applied a rebuttable\npresumption in favor of the father in this case.\n  Next, the grandmother claims that the use of this\npresumption by the trial court was harmful because the\nresults of the proceedings may have been different had\nthe court not employed such a presumption. We\ndisagree.\n    The parties agree that our standard of review requires\nthe grandmother to prove that the court\u2019s use of a rebut-\ntable presumption in favor of the father was harmful.\nSee generally In re Avirex R., 151 Conn. App. 820,\n833\u201334, 96 A.3d 662 (2014) (despite court\u2019s use of\nimproper subsection of \u00a7 46b-129, impropriety was\nharmless because court properly found that transfer\nof guardianship was in child\u2019s best interest and that\nguardian was suitable and worthy); In re Elvin G.,\nsupra, 310 Conn. 506 (court\u2019s failure to provide statuto-\nrily mandated steps was harmless because, \u2018\u2018even if\nsuch steps had been provided, they could not have\nmade a difference in the trial court\u2019s finding of the\nrespondent\u2019s failure to rehabilitate\u2019\u2019). \u2018\u2018Errors of law\nconstitute no ground of reversal if they are immaterial\nor such as have not injuriously affected the appellant.\u2019\u2019\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Wood v. Connecti-\ncut Savings Bank, 87 Conn. 341, 350, 87 A. 983 (1913).\n\u2018\u2018It is axiomatic that to require reversal, error must be\nharmful.

In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No.\n10718), 188 Conn. 259, 266, 449 A.2d 165 (1982) (Shea,\nJ., dissenting).\n  \u2018\u2018Questions of custodial placement generally are\nresolved by a factbound determination of what is in\nthe best interest of the child . . . as shown by a fair\npreponderance of the evidence. . . . To determine\nwhether a custodial placement is in the best interest of\nthe child, the court uses its broad discretion to choose a\nplace that will foster the child\u2019s interest in sustained\ngrowth, development, well-being, and in the continuity\nand stability of its environment. . . . We have stated\n\fthat when making the determination of what is in the\nbest interest of the child, [t]he authority to exercise the\njudicial discretion under the circumstances revealed by\nthe finding is not conferred upon this court, but upon\nthe trial court . . . . Nothing short of a conviction that\nthe action of the trial court is one which discloses a\nclear abuse of discretion can warrant our interference.\n. . . [G]reat weight is given to the judgment of the trial\ncourt because of [the court\u2019s] opportunity to observe\nthe parties and the evidence. . . . [Appellate courts]\nare not in a position to second-guess the opinions of\nwitnesses, professional or otherwise, nor the observa-\ntions and conclusions of the [trial court] when they are\nbased on reliable evidence.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) In re Isaiah J., 141 Conn. App. 474, 476, 62\nA.3d 635, cert. denied, 308 Conn. 936, 66 A.3d 498 (2013).\n   In the present case, the court very clearly set forth\nits reasons for transferring custody and guardianship\nof the children from the grandmother to the children\u2019s\nfather. It is evident from the court\u2019s findings that it\nbelieved that the grandmother loves these children and\nthat she has provided for them to the best of her ability.\nNevertheless, the grandmother has, inter alia, extensive\nhealth issues that render her unable to provide for the\nparticular needs of these children, despite her desire\nto do so.\n   The court, in turn, found that the children\u2019s father\nhas the desire and the means to care for his children\nand to address their particular medical and behavioral\nconcerns. It further found that it would be in the best\ninterest of the children for custody and guardianship\nto be transferred to the father, and that he is a suitable\nand worthy guardian. The grandmother does not con-\ntest any of the court\u2019s findings, and they are fully sup-\nported by the record. Accordingly, although the court\nimproperly stated that there was a rebuttable presump-\ntion in favor of the parent, it is clear, based on its\nbest interest analysis, that the presumption played an\ninsignificant role, if any, in the court\u2019s reasoned deci-\nsion; the court made the necessary findings pursuant\nto \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2) to support its decision to transfer\ncustody and guardianship to Angel J. Accordingly, we\naffirm that decision.\n   The judgments are affirmed.\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  * In accordance with the spirit and intent of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-142\n(b) and Practice Book \u00a7 79a-12, the names of the parties involved in this\nappeal are not disclosed. The records and papers of this case shall be open\nfor inspection only to persons having a proper interest therein and upon\norder of the Appellate Court.\n  ** October 16, 2014, the date that this decision was released as a slip\nopinion, is the operative date for all substantive and procedural purposes.\n  1\n    The mother of the children, the respondent Janielle B., has filed a position\npaper in this court adopting the brief of the grandmother. During the trial,\nthe attorney for the children asked that the children remain with the grand-\nmother. On appeal, however, the attorney for the children and the attorney\nfor the respondent father have filed position papers adopting the brief of\n\fthe petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families.\n   2\n     We note that the grandmother filed separate appeals in this case from\neach of the individual judgments. Both judgments arise from the same\nmemorandum of decision and both appeals are based on the same substan-\ntive issues, namely, whether the court improperly employed a rebuttable\npresumption and whether the use of that presumption was harmful. As a\nresult, we will resolve both appeals in the same opinion in the interests of\njudicial economy.\n   3\n     There is nothing in the record that indicates the circumstances sur-\nrounding the Probate Court\u2019s award of custody and guardianship to the\ngrandmother.\n   4\n     The court set forth lengthy and significant factual findings in its memoran-\ndum of decision with respect to the grandmother\u2019s medical condition as\nwell as the medical conditions of the minor children. It serves no useful\npurpose to repeat all of the court\u2019s specific findings as to these issues in\nthis opinion, except to note generally how these issues impacted the court\u2019s\nultimate findings regarding the best placement for the children.\n   5\n     A careful review of the electronic transcripts in this case also reveals\nthat in March, 2013, the father apparently had filed, in the family court, a\npetition for custody of the children. The exact status of that petition is not\npart of our record. It also is not clear whether the trial court had a copy\nof that petition or whether it considered the filing thereof when rendering\nthe judgments in this case.\n   6\n     The court issued the relevant orders on form JD-JM-65, generally used\nin neglect proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (j), adjudicating the children\nneglected and ordering that custody and guardianship be vested in the\nchildren\u2019s father, subject to six months of protective supervision.\n   At the same time, however, the court also issued two orders on form JD-\nJM-76, which traditionally applies in revocation of commitment proceedings\nunder General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (m), ordering the revocation of the custody\nand guardianship vested in the grandmother, and ordering that custody\nand guardianship revert to the children\u2019s father with six months protective\nsupervision. The propriety, import or relevance of this order has not been\nraised, briefed or addressed by the parties, nor was a copy of the order\nmade part of the grandmother\u2019s appendix.\n   7\n     In its memorandum of decision, the court did not cite to any statute\nupon which it relied in applying the presumption at issue. We note, however,\nthat the petitioner, in an argument to the trial court, cited General Statutes\n\u00a7 46b-56b in support of the position that the court should transfer custody\nand guardianship to Angel J.; the grandmother did not object to or argue\nthe inapplicability of that statute. Thus, we presume that the court was\nreferring to \u00a7 46b-56b when it stated that there was a rebuttal presumption\nin favor of the father in this case. Section 46b-56b contains a statutory\nrebuttable presumption in favor of the parent in custody disputes between\na parent and a nonparent. We use this opportunity to reiterate that the\napplicability of \u00a7 46b-56b is restricted to dissolution and custody matters\nbrought under chapter 815j of the General Statutes and is not applicable in\ncases that do not arise from dissolution of marriage, legal separation or\nannulment actions.

The respondent Carol B., the maternal\ngrandmother of the minor children at issue in this mat-\nter (grandmother), appeals from the judgments of the\ntrial court removing her as guardian and custodian of\nthe children, Jaccari J. and Justin J., and ordering that\ncustody and guardianship be vested in the children\u2019s\nfather, the respondent Angel J.1 On appeal, the grand-\nmother claims that, after the court adjudicated the chil-\ndren neglected, it improperly employed a rebuttable\npresumption in favor of the children\u2019s father when\ndetermining in whom to vest custody and guardianship\nof the children, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129\n(j) (2), and that the use of the rebuttable presumption\nwas harmful. We conclude that the court\u2019s use of a\nrebuttable presumption in favor of the children\u2019s father\nduring the dispositional phase of the neglect proceed-\nings was improper. That error notwithstanding, how-\never, we further conclude, on the basis of the trial\ncourt\u2019s extensive uncontested factual findings and thor-\nough best interest analysis, that the grandmother has\nfailed to demonstrate that she was harmed by the\ncourt\u2019s use of a rebuttable presumption in this case.\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.2\n   On April 25, 2005, the Probate Court awarded custody\nand guardianship of the children to the grandmother.3\nOn June 19, 2013, the petitioner, the Commissioner of\nChildren and Families, filed a neglect petition on behalf\nof the children. After the trial on the neglect petition,\nthe court found that, while living with the grandmother,\nthe children had \u2018\u2018been denied proper care and atten-\ntion, physically, educationally, emotionally, or morally,\nand [had] been permitted to live under conditions, cir-\ncumstances, or associations injurious to their well-\nbeing.\u2019\u2019 In its decision, the court noted that the children\nhave several medical and behavioral issues. They need\ndaily medication, and they lack exercise and healthy\neating habits.4 Appointments with doctors, nutritionists,\ntherapists and counselors were made for them but were\nnot attended, and previous therapy and medical provid-\ners discharged the children due to missed\nappointments.\n   During its analysis of the dispositional phase of the\ntrial, the court engaged in a thorough examination of\nand comparison between placing the children with the\ngrandmother and placing them with their father.5 With\nrespect to the grandmother, the court made the follow-\ning relevant findings. The children had resided with the\ngrandmother since they were infants, but her apartment\nis small. The grandmother and her brother, who also\nlives in the small apartment, had smoked in the home\ndespite the presence of the children and an oxygen\ntank. The grandmother suffers from medical conditions\nthat limit her mobility; she is disabled. Her medical\nconditions previously have caused her to be hospital-\n\fized, and have caused her to miss, cancel, reschedule\nor be unable to schedule medical and counseling\nappointments for the children. Those conditions also\nhamper her ability to insure that the children get proper\nmedical care and therapy. She also has no means of\ntransportation. For months prior to trial, she refused\nto allow the employees of the Department of Children\nand Families to enter her home, and the trial court\nstated that it was not sure whether the children were\nresiding there; Jaccari J. reported to a therapist that he\nand his brother were residing, instead, with their great\naunt, who lives in the same apartment building as the\ngrandmother. The grandmother is strict with the chil-\ndren and has struggled with the parenting style recom-\nmended by therapists. The grandmother loves the\nchildren and has tried to do the best that she can for\nthem.\n   With respect to the children\u2019s father, Angel J., the\ncourt found that he has been arrested and jailed pre-\nviously; his criminal record includes felonies from the\n1980s and 1990s. He does work at his father\u2019s church\nand runs errands for his father. His father, a reverend\nat the church, allows Angel J., in exchange for the work\nhe does, to live rent free in a two-family home owned\nby the church. The home is large enough for each child\nto have his own room. Angel J.\u2019s father also gives him\nmoney for the care of the children and for food. Angel\nJ. has access to a car, and he transports the children\nto and from school each day. He also is available to\ntake the children to their various medical and therapy\nappointments. He always has been a part of the chil-\ndren\u2019s lives and attends church with them on Sundays,\nbut has a hard time saying \u2018\u2018no\u2019\u2019 to them and would\nbring them to McDonald\u2019s after school. The court found,\nhowever, that Angel J. now understands that the chil-\ndren need to be on a strict diet. Angel J. loves the\nchildren.\n   Significantly, the court found that the children\u2019s\nfather could best tailor the food intake of the children\nand regulate their meals. The children were more open\nand acted differently when attending therapy sessions\nwith their father. The court also found that the father\ncould better follow the recommendations of the thera-\npists in addressing the behavioral issues of the children\nat home.\n   Ultimately, the court concluded that the children had\n\u2018\u2018a long-term continuous relationship with their biologi-\ncal parent, the father. [The grandmother] has been\nunable to provide for the boys\u2019 medical and therapy\nneeds and follow through with the recommendations\nof the therapists on a consistent basis. Their housing\nis now in question as to the condition of the apartment,\nthe boys\u2019 accommodations in the apartment and\nwhether the boys actually reside in that apartment. The\nfather has his own first floor unit with plenty of room\n\ffor the boys. He has transportation to take them to\nschool and to all their medical and therapy appoint-\nments. He has the flexibility with his schedule to accom-\nmodate their needs. He is their natural parent. There\nis a presumption that the boys should be with a natural\nparent. The court knows that presumption is rebuttable\nbut, in light of all the above, there has been insufficient\nevidence presented to rebut the presumption.\u2019\u2019\n   The court went on to find, by a fair preponderance\nof the evidence, that \u2018\u2018it is in the best interest of both\n[children] that guardianship and custody be transferred\nto their father, Angel J., and that there be a period of\nprotective supervision for [six] months; that Angel J.\nsign specific steps to ensure the boys\u2019 medical and\ntherapeutic needs are met; that he conform their diet\nto the recommendations of their doctors and the nutri-\ntionist; and that he allow [the grandmother] visitation\nwith the boys.\u2019\u20196 Thereafter, the grandmother filed the\npresent appeal.\n   The petitioner filed motions for articulation\nrequesting that the court articulate whether it had\nfound, on the basis of the evidence, that the children\u2019s\nfather was suitable and worthy to care for each of the\nchildren. The grandmother offered no objection to the\npetitioner\u2019s motions, and the court responded by filing\nan articulation related to each of the children, setting\nforth the same findings in each articulation:\n  \u2018\u2018The court finds that Angel J., the biological father\nof [the children] is suitable and worthy. This is based\non the record and findings stated in the court\u2019s decision,\nincluding, but not limited to, the following:\n  \u2018\u20181. The father has had a loving, active and continuous\nrelationship with [the children] since [they were] young.\nHe was transporting [them] to school every day and to\nmedical and therapy appointments when allowed. He\nhad weekend visitations with [the children].\n  \u2018\u20182. He has a motor vehicle to take [the children]\nto [their] medical, therapy and specialist appointments\nthat are necessary to address [their] specialized needs.\n  \u2018\u20183. The father resides on the first floor of a house\nthat has ample room for [the children]. They each have\ntheir own room.\n  \u2018\u20184. The father has the time necessary to take [the\nchildren] to all [their] required appointments.\n  \u2018\u20185. The father can prepare and supervise [the chil-\ndren\u2019s] dietary needs.\u2019\u2019\n  On appeal, the grandmother does not contest the\ncourt\u2019s finding of neglect or any of the extensive find-\nings supporting the court\u2019s disposition in this case; she\nargues only that, after adjudicating the children\nneglected, the court improperly used a rebuttable pre-\nsumption in favor of the children\u2019s father, and that this\nwas harmful because the result of the proceedings may\n\fhave been different had the presumption not been\nemployed.7 Under the uncontested facts of this case,\nwhich the court set forth in specific detail in its memo-\nrandum of decision, we conclude that, although the\nuse of the rebuttable presumption was improper, the\ngrandmother has failed to demonstrate that the error\nwas harmful.\n   Here, the grandmother contends that, although there\nis no rebuttable presumption found in \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2),\nwhich applies in this case, the court improperly used\na presumption in favor of the parent when it was\ndetermining in whom to vest custody and guardianship\nof the children. We agree.\n   \u2018\u2018When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objec-\ntive is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent\nof the legislature. . . . In other words, we seek to\ndetermine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the\nstatutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case,\nincluding the question of whether the language actually\ndoes apply. . . . In seeking to determine that meaning,\nGeneral Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the\ntext of the statute itself and its relationship to other\nstatutes. If, after examining such text and considering\nsuch relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and\nunambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable\nresults, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the\nstatute shall not be considered.\u2019\u2019 (Internal quotation\nmarks omitted.)

It is evident from the court\u2019s findings that it\nbelieved that the grandmother loves these children and\nthat she has provided for them to the best of her ability.\nNevertheless, the grandmother has, inter alia, extensive\nhealth issues that render her unable to provide for the\nparticular needs of these children, despite her desire\nto do so.\n   The court, in turn, found that the children\u2019s father\nhas the desire and the means to care for his children\nand to address their particular medical and behavioral\nconcerns. It further found that it would be in the best\ninterest of the children for custody and guardianship\nto be transferred to the father, and that he is a suitable\nand worthy guardian. The grandmother does not con-\ntest any of the court\u2019s findings, and they are fully sup-\nported by the record. Accordingly, although the court\nimproperly stated that there was a rebuttable presump-\ntion in favor of the parent, it is clear, based on its\nbest interest analysis, that the presumption played an\ninsignificant role, if any, in the court\u2019s reasoned deci-\nsion; the court made the necessary findings pursuant\nto \u00a7 46b-129 (j) (2) to support its decision to transfer\ncustody and guardianship to Angel J. Accordingly, we\naffirm that decision.\n   The judgments are affirmed.\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  * In accordance with the spirit and intent of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-142\n(b) and Practice Book \u00a7 79a-12, the names of the parties involved in this\nappeal are not disclosed. The records and papers of this case shall be open\nfor inspection only to persons having a proper interest therein and upon\norder of the Appellate Court.\n  ** October 16, 2014, the date that this decision was released as a slip\nopinion, is the operative date for all substantive and procedural purposes.\n  1\n    The mother of the children, the respondent Janielle B., has filed a position\npaper in this court adopting the brief of the grandmother. During the trial,\nthe attorney for the children asked that the children remain with the grand-\nmother. On appeal, however, the attorney for the children and the attorney\nfor the respondent father have filed position papers adopting the brief of\n\fthe petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families.\n   2\n     We note that the grandmother filed separate appeals in this case from\neach of the individual judgments. Both judgments arise from the same\nmemorandum of decision and both appeals are based on the same substan-\ntive issues, namely, whether the court improperly employed a rebuttable\npresumption and whether the use of that presumption was harmful. As a\nresult, we will resolve both appeals in the same opinion in the interests of\njudicial economy.\n   3\n     There is nothing in the record that indicates the circumstances sur-\nrounding the Probate Court\u2019s award of custody and guardianship to the\ngrandmother.\n   4\n     The court set forth lengthy and significant factual findings in its memoran-\ndum of decision with respect to the grandmother\u2019s medical condition as\nwell as the medical conditions of the minor children. It serves no useful\npurpose to repeat all of the court\u2019s specific findings as to these issues in\nthis opinion, except to note generally how these issues impacted the court\u2019s\nultimate findings regarding the best placement for the children.\n   5\n     A careful review of the electronic transcripts in this case also reveals\nthat in March, 2013, the father apparently had filed, in the family court, a\npetition for custody of the children. The exact status of that petition is not\npart of our record. It also is not clear whether the trial court had a copy\nof that petition or whether it considered the filing thereof when rendering\nthe judgments in this case.\n   6\n     The court issued the relevant orders on form JD-JM-65, generally used\nin neglect proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 46b-129 (j), adjudicating the children\nneglected and ordering that custody and guardianship be vested in the\nchildren\u2019s father, subject to six months of protective supervision.\n   At the same time, however, the court also issued two orders on form JD-\nJM-76, which traditionally applies in revocation of commitment proceedings\nunder General Statutes \u00a7 46b-129 (m), ordering the revocation of the custody\nand guardianship vested in the grandmother, and ordering that custody\nand guardianship revert to the children\u2019s father with six months protective\nsupervision. The propriety, import or relevance of this order has not been\nraised, briefed or addressed by the parties, nor was a copy of the order\nmade part of the grandmother\u2019s appendix.\n   7\n     In its memorandum of decision, the court did not cite to any statute\nupon which it relied in applying the presumption at issue. We note, however,\nthat the petitioner, in an argument to the trial court, cited General Statutes\n\u00a7 46b-56b in support of the position that the court should transfer custody\nand guardianship to Angel J.; the grandmother did not object to or argue\nthe inapplicability of that statute. Thus, we presume that the court was\nreferring to \u00a7 46b-56b when it stated that there was a rebuttal presumption\nin favor of the father in this case. Section 46b-56b contains a statutory\nrebuttable presumption in favor of the parent in custody disputes between\na parent and a nonparent. We use this opportunity to reiterate that the\napplicability of \u00a7 46b-56b is restricted to dissolution and custody matters\nbrought under chapter 815j of the General Statutes and is not applicable in\ncases that do not arise from dissolution of marriage, legal separation or\nannulment actions.
