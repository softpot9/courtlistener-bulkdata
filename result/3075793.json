We affirm.\n\n      Chiles\u2019s appointed counsel filed an Anders brief asserting that he has diligently\n\nreviewed the appellate record and that, in his opinion, the appeal is frivolous. See\n\nAnders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967). Counsel informed Chiles of his right to submit\n\na brief on his own behalf, and Chiles filed a brief. However, we review a pro se brief or\n\fother response solely to determine if there are any arguable grounds for appeal. Bledsoe\n\nv. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 827 (Tex. Crim.

See Bledsoe v.\n\nState, 178 S.W.3d 824, 826-27 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). Accordingly, we affirm the trial\n\ncourt's judgment.\n\n        Should Chiles wish to seek further review of this case by the Texas Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals, he must either retain an attorney to file a petition for discretionary\n\nreview or must file a pro se petition for discretionary review.
