Butler (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 557, the defendant was guilty of\nthe crime of stalking because he threatened the victim with violence. (Pen. Code,\n\u00a7 646.9.)1 We held the defendant's offense qualified him as a mentally disordered offender\n(MDO). (Butler, supra, 74 Cal.App.4th 557, 561; \u00a7 2962, subd. (e)(2)(Q).)\n                 Here we hold that a defendant whose stalking offense involves implied\nthreats of violence also meets the criteria of an MDO. Elias Itehua appeals a judgment\ncommitting him to the California Department of Mental Health (now known as State\nDepartment of State Hospitals) for treatment as an MDO, following his conviction of\nstalking. (\u00a7 646.9.) His stalking offense involves a pattern of conduct that \"impliedly\nthreatened another with the use of force or violence\" within the meaning of section 2962,\nsubdivision (e)(2)(Q). We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1\n    All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\f                                 PROCEDURAL FACTS\n              On July 30, 2013, the Board of Parole Hearings determined that Itehua met\nthe criteria of section 2962 to be committed as an MDO. Itehua filed a petition for\nappointment of counsel and hearing to contest the determination. (\u00a7 2966, subd. (b).)\n              Psychologist Phylissa Kwartner testified that Itehua has a severe mental\ndisorder. She said he suffers from schizophrenia-paranoid type and has a history of\npsychosis and auditory hallucinations. He believes \"voices are emanating from his chest.\"\n              Itehua was convicted of stalking a married woman in violation of a\nrestraining order obtained against him. Itehua repeatedly called, texted, and followed her,\nand \"appeared at her house on a regular basis.\" He had the \"manic\" delusion that \"the\nvictim of his offense was in a relationship with him.\" When he appeared at the victim's\nhouse on August 1, 2012, she \"used pepper spray and called the police.\" Kwartner said his\nmental disorder was \"at least an aggravating, if not, a causal factor\" in the commission of\nhis stalking offense.\n              Kwartner testified Itehua's disorder was not in remission and could not be\nkept in remission without treatment. Itehua received five months of treatment. She said he\ndid not \"voluntarily follow the treatment plan.\" He lacks insight about his disorder. He\nrepresents a substantial danger of physical harm to others because of his disorder. \"[H]e\nremains at risk for returning\" to the stalking behavior that was involved in his commitment\noffense. Itehua \"would likely try to find this victim again upon release.\" Kwartner said he\nmet all the criteria for an MDO commitment.\n              The trial court found that Itehua met the requisite MDO criteria. The court\nfound there was evidence \"of some degree of force toward the victim\" based on several\nfactors: \"[Itehua] was stalking her repeatedly,\" there was a restraining order, and \"the\nvictim needed to pull out pepper spray to protect herself.\"\n                                       DISCUSSION\n              Stalking as a Commitment Offense Falling Within Section 2962\n              We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment drawing all\nreasonable inferences in support of the court's findings. (People v. Ewing (1999) 76\n\n                                              2\n\fCal.App.4th 199, 209.) We do not decide the credibility of witnesses or weigh the\nevidence. (People v. Ochoa (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206-1207.)\n              Before a prisoner may be committed as an MDO, the court must find that he\nor she committed (1) an offense listed in section 2962, subdivision (e)(2); or 2) an offense\nnot listed, \"used force or violence, or caused serious bodily injury\" (\u00a7 2962, subd.\n(e)(2)(P)); or (3) \"[a] crime in which the perpetrator expressly or impliedly threatened\nanother with the use of force or violence likely to produce substantial physical harm in\nsuch a manner that a reasonable person would believe and expect that the force or violence\nwould be used\" (\u00a7 2962, subd. (e)(2)(Q), italics added). \"For purposes of this\nsubparagraph, substantial physical harm shall not require proof that the threatened act was\nlikely to cause great or serious bodily injury.\" (Ibid.)\n              Itehua notes that stalking is not one of the listed crimes in section 2962. He\ncontends that to qualify for an MDO commitment, his offense must fall within one of the\n\"catch all\" provisions of the statute. He argues his stalking offense (\u00a7 646.9) was not \"a\ncrime of force or violence, as required for commitment under the MDO statute.\"\n(Boldface omitted.)\n              Section 646.9, subdivision (a) provides: \"Any person who willfully,\nmaliciously, and repeatedly follows or willfully and maliciously harasses another person\nand who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for\nhis or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family is guilty of the crime of\nstalking . . . .\" (Italics added.) Consequently, proof that the defendant made \"a credible\nthreat\" is a required element for a conviction of stalking. (People v. Ewing, supra, 76\nCal.App.4th at p. 210.)\n              In Butler, we held that a defendant who committed the offense of stalking\ncame within the commitment offense requirement for an MDO commitment. (People v.\nButler, supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at p. 561.) \"Appellant's stalking conviction under section\n646.9 meets the criteria of section 2962, subdivision (e)(2)(Q).\" (Ibid.) \"A conviction\nunder section 646.9, subdivision (a) necessarily meets the definition of force . . . .\" (Id. at\np. 560, italics added.)\n\n                                               3\n\f              Itehua claims Butler is distinguishable because there the defendant made a\nverbal threat of violence and made no verbal threats. \"[The defendant] followed his victim\nand threatened to kill her and members of her immediate family.\" (People v. Butler, supra,\n74 Cal.App.4th at pp. 561-562.) Kwartner acknowledged in her testimony that Itehua did\nnot \"verbally\" threaten the victim with violence.\n              The stalking statute defines a \"credible threat\" as \"a verbal or written threat\n. . . or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct . . . made with the intent to place the person\nthat is the target of the threat in reasonable fear for his or her safety . . . and made with the\napparent ability to carry out the threat . . . . \" (\u00a7 646.9, subd. (g), italics added.) The MDO\nstatutory scheme and section 646.9 are harmonious. They contain similar language and\nwere enacted to achieve the same underlying goal to protect the public.\n              An implied credible threat may be inferred from a pattern of stalking\nconduct. (People v. Uecker (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 583, 595 [\"a reasonable jury could\nhave found that defendant made an implied threat to her safety in that he was going to do\nwhatever he needed to get M. to go out with him\"]; People v. Falck (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th\n287, 299 [\"it can be inferred that appellant intended to cause fear in the victim from the\nfact that he insisted on maintaining contact with her although she clearly was attempting to\navoid him, and although he had been warned away by the police\"].)\n              The trial court reasonably inferred Itehua's pattern of conduct was an implied\ncredible threat. The victim was a married woman with children who did not want Itehua to\ncontact her. Kwartner said she \"was trying to get away from him; she had a restraining\norder against him.\" But Itehua violated that restraining order. Kwartner further testified,\n\"Itehua continued to call her, text her, follow her, he appeared at her house on a regular\nbasis. He continued calling her despite her changing her phone number nine times. . . . He\nalso went to the victim's husband's workplace and harassed him.\" Itehua had an\n\"erotomanic delusion\" that he \"was in a relationship with his victim.\" On August 1, 2012,\nItehua went to her home again. The victim \"used pepper spray and called the police.\"\n              \"[S]talking is an act of domestic violence . . . .\" (People v. Ogle (2010) 185\nCal.App.4th 1138, 1140.) In Butler, we held stalking is an MDO qualifying offense where\n\n                                                4\n\fthe defendant made express threats, but we did not exclude stalking involving a pattern of\nimplied threats. \"An implied threat of force was one that 'invited resistance or escape with\npossible resulting injury.'\" (People v. Butler, supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at p. 560.) Here the\ntrial court reasonably inferred that Itehua's pattern of conduct was an implied threat that\ninvited resistance or escape. Harassment restraining orders are issued on a showing that\nthere is \"a course of conduct that would place a reasonable person in fear for his or her\nsafety.\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 527.6, subd. (b)(2).)\n              Itehua violated the restraining order to achieve his \"erotomanic delusion.\"\nThis would instill fear in any reasonable person repeatedly targeted by a severely mentally\ndisordered man who held such a delusion. Indeed, the trial court found the victim \"needed\nto pull out pepper spray to protect herself.\"\n              The judgment is affirmed.\n              CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION.\n\n\n\n\n                                           GILBERT, P.

He\ncontends that to qualify for an MDO commitment, his offense must fall within one of the\n\"catch all\" provisions of the statute. He argues his stalking offense (\u00a7 646.9) was not \"a\ncrime of force or violence, as required for commitment under the MDO statute.\"\n(Boldface omitted.)\n              Section 646.9, subdivision (a) provides: \"Any person who willfully,\nmaliciously, and repeatedly follows or willfully and maliciously harasses another person\nand who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for\nhis or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family is guilty of the crime of\nstalking . . . .\" (Italics added.) Consequently, proof that the defendant made \"a credible\nthreat\" is a required element for a conviction of stalking. (People v. Ewing, supra, 76\nCal.App.4th at p. 210.)\n              In Butler, we held that a defendant who committed the offense of stalking\ncame within the commitment offense requirement for an MDO commitment. (People v.\nButler, supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at p. 561.) \"Appellant's stalking conviction under section\n646.9 meets the criteria of section 2962, subdivision (e)(2)(Q).\" (Ibid.) \"A conviction\nunder section 646.9, subdivision (a) necessarily meets the definition of force . . . .\" (Id. at\np. 560, italics added.)\n\n                                               3\n\f              Itehua claims Butler is distinguishable because there the defendant made a\nverbal threat of violence and made no verbal threats. \"[The defendant] followed his victim\nand threatened to kill her and members of her immediate family.\" (People v. Butler, supra,\n74 Cal.App.4th at pp. 561-562.) Kwartner acknowledged in her testimony that Itehua did\nnot \"verbally\" threaten the victim with violence.\n              The stalking statute defines a \"credible threat\" as \"a verbal or written threat\n. . . or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct . . . made with the intent to place the person\nthat is the target of the threat in reasonable fear for his or her safety . . . and made with the\napparent ability to carry out the threat . . . . \" (\u00a7 646.9, subd. (g), italics added.) The MDO\nstatutory scheme and section 646.9 are harmonious. They contain similar language and\nwere enacted to achieve the same underlying goal to protect the public.\n              An implied credible threat may be inferred from a pattern of stalking\nconduct.

The victim was a married woman with children who did not want Itehua to\ncontact her. Kwartner said she \"was trying to get away from him; she had a restraining\norder against him.\" But Itehua violated that restraining order. Kwartner further testified,\n\"Itehua continued to call her, text her, follow her, he appeared at her house on a regular\nbasis. He continued calling her despite her changing her phone number nine times. . . . He\nalso went to the victim's husband's workplace and harassed him.\" Itehua had an\n\"erotomanic delusion\" that he \"was in a relationship with his victim.\" On August 1, 2012,\nItehua went to her home again. The victim \"used pepper spray and called the police.\"\n              \"[S]talking is an act of domestic violence . . . .\" (People v.

In Butler, we held stalking is an MDO qualifying offense where\n\n                                                4\n\fthe defendant made express threats, but we did not exclude stalking involving a pattern of\nimplied threats. \"An implied threat of force was one that 'invited resistance or escape with\npossible resulting injury.'\" (People v. Butler, supra, 74 Cal.App.4th at p. 560.) Here the\ntrial court reasonably inferred that Itehua's pattern of conduct was an implied threat that\ninvited resistance or escape. Harassment restraining orders are issued on a showing that\nthere is \"a course of conduct that would place a reasonable person in fear for his or her\nsafety.\" (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 527.6, subd. (b)(2).)\n              Itehua violated the restraining order to achieve his \"erotomanic delusion.\"\nThis would instill fear in any reasonable person repeatedly targeted by a severely mentally\ndisordered man who held such a delusion. Indeed, the trial court found the victim \"needed\nto pull out pepper spray to protect herself.\"\n              The judgment is affirmed.\n              CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION.\n\n\n\n\n                                           GILBERT, P.
