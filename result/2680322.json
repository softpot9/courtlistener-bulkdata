Elias Itehua appeals a judgment\ncommitting him to the California Department of Mental Health (now known as State\nDepartment of State Hospitals) for treatment as an MDO, following his conviction of\nstalking. (\u00a7 646.9.) His stalking offense involves a pattern of conduct that \"impliedly\nthreatened another with the use of force or violence\" within the meaning of section 2962,\nsubdivision (e)(2)(Q).

Itehua filed a petition for\nappointment of counsel and hearing to contest the determination. (\u00a7 2966, subd. (b).)\n              Psychologist Phylissa Kwartner testified that Itehua has a severe mental\ndisorder. She said he suffers from schizophrenia-paranoid type and has a history of\npsychosis and auditory hallucinations. He believes \"voices are emanating from his chest.\"\n              Itehua was convicted of stalking a married woman in violation of a\nrestraining order obtained against him. Itehua repeatedly called, texted, and followed her,\nand \"appeared at her house on a regular basis.\" He had the \"manic\" delusion that \"the\nvictim of his offense was in a relationship with him.\" When he appeared at the victim's\nhouse on August 1, 2012, she \"used pepper spray and called the police.\" Kwartner said his\nmental disorder was \"at least an aggravating, if not, a causal factor\" in the commission of\nhis stalking offense.\n              Kwartner testified Itehua's disorder was not in remission and could not be\nkept in remission without treatment. Itehua received five months of treatment. She said he\ndid not \"voluntarily follow the treatment plan.\" He lacks insight about his disorder. He\nrepresents a substantial danger of physical harm to others because of his disorder. \"[H]e\nremains at risk for returning\" to the stalking behavior that was involved in his commitment\noffense. Itehua \"would likely try to find this victim again upon release.\" Kwartner said he\nmet all the criteria for an MDO commitment.\n              The trial court found that Itehua met the requisite MDO criteria. The court\nfound there was evidence \"of some degree of force toward the victim\" based on several\nfactors: \"[Itehua] was stalking her repeatedly,\" there was a restraining order, and \"the\nvictim needed to pull out pepper spray to protect herself.\"\n                                       DISCUSSION\n              Stalking as a Commitment Offense Falling Within Section 2962\n              We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment drawing all\nreasonable inferences in support of the court's findings.

He\ncontends that to qualify for an MDO commitment, his offense must fall within one of the\n\"catch all\" provisions of the statute. He argues his stalking offense (\u00a7 646.9) was not \"a\ncrime of force or violence, as required for commitment under the MDO statute.\"\n(Boldface omitted.)\n              Section 646.9, subdivision (a) provides: \"Any person who willfully,\nmaliciously, and repeatedly follows or willfully and maliciously harasses another person\nand who makes a credible threat with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for\nhis or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family is guilty of the crime of\nstalking . . . .\" (Italics added.) Consequently, proof that the defendant made \"a credible\nthreat\" is a required element for a conviction of stalking. (People v. Ewing, supra, 76\nCal.App.4th at p. 210.)\n              In Butler, we held that a defendant who committed the offense of stalking\ncame within the commitment offense requirement for an MDO commitment.

Butler, supra,\n74 Cal.App.4th at pp. 561-562.) Kwartner acknowledged in her testimony that Itehua did\nnot \"verbally\" threaten the victim with violence.\n              The stalking statute defines a \"credible threat\" as \"a verbal or written threat\n. . . or a threat implied by a pattern of conduct . . . made with the intent to place the person\nthat is the target of the threat in reasonable fear for his or her safety . . . and made with the\napparent ability to carry out the threat . . . . \" (\u00a7 646.9, subd.
