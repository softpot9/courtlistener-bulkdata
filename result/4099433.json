She filed a claim for workers'\ncompensation benefits, which was established for posttraumatic\n\f                              -2-                522762\n\nstress disorder and neck injury. Claimant also commenced an\naction in federal court against her employer and the associate\ndean alleging a hostile work environment, discrimination, battery\nand assault. That action settled in August 2013 for $255,000,\nwith both defendants contributing funds to the settlement and\n$65,000 specifically allocated for \"back and front pay.\"\nThereafter, the employer's workers' compensation carrier, the\nState Insurance Fund (hereinafter the carrier), asserted that\nclaimant should be barred from future workers' compensation\nbenefits because she had neither sought nor obtained its consent\nto the settlement as required by Workers' Compensation Law \u00a7 29\n(5). Claimant contended that the carrier's consent was not\nrequired because the federal action was not a third-party action\nwithin the meaning of the statute. A Workers' Compensation Law\nJudge determined that the federal action was a third-party\naction, which claimant had settled without seeking or obtaining\nthe carrier's consent, and, accordingly, that she forfeited\nfurther benefits as of the date of the August 2013 settlement.\nThe Workers' Compensation Board affirmed and claimant now\nappeals.\n\n      We affirm. \"Workers' Compensation Law \u00a7 29 (5) requires\neither the carrier's consent or a compromise order from the court\nin which the third-party action is pending for a claimant to\nsettle a third-party action and continue receiving compensation\nbenefits\" (Matter of Johnson v Buffalo & Erie County Private\nIndus. Council, 84 NY2d 13, 19 [1994]; see Matter of Hulbert v\nCortland County Sheriff's Dept., 69 AD3d 987, 988 [2010], lv\ndenied 14 NY3d 710 [2010]; Matter of Wright v Golden Arrow Line,\n206 AD2d 759, 760 [1994]). Claimant urges that her federal\nlawsuit was not a third-party action since the statute addresses\n\"the negligence or wrong of another not in the same employ\"\n(Workers' Compensation Law \u00a7 29 [1]) and the associate dean who\nharassed her had the same employer as her. The Court of Appeals,\nhowever, has recently reiterated that Workers' Compensation Law\n\u00a7 29, \"'read in its entirety and in context, clearly reveals a\nlegislative design to provide for reimbursement of the\ncompensation carrier whenever a recovery is obtained in tort for\nthe same injury that was a predicate for the payment of\ncompensation benefits'\" (Matter of Beth V. v New York State Off.\nof Children & Family Servs., 22 NY3d 80, 91 [2013], quoting\n\f                              -3-                522762\n\nMatter of Petterson v Daystrom Corp., 17 NY2d 32, 39 [1966]).\n\"The Court reasoned that \"'[i]t would be unreasonable to read the\nstatute as mandating a different result merely because the\nrecovery came out of the pockets of a coemployee [or the\nemployer] and not from the resources of a stranger'\" (Ronkese v\nTilcon N.Y., Inc., 129 AD3d 1273, 1275 [2015], lv dismissed ___\nNY3d ___ [Nov. 1, 2016], quoting Matter of Beth V. v New York\nState Off. of Children & Family Servs., 22 NY3d at 91). The fact\nthat claimant included allegations of intentional conduct by a\ncoemployee in her federal action does not, as urged by claimant,\ncompel the conclusion that it was not a third-party action (see\nMatter of Beth V. v New York State Off. of Children & Family\nServs., 22 NY3d at 91-92; Hanford v Plaza Packaging Corp., 2 NY3d\n348, 351, n 3 [2004]; but cf.

Given such finding,\nthe Board's determination that the federal action was a third-\nparty action is consistent with the case law construing Workers'\nCompensation Law \u00a7 29 notwithstanding the involvement of a\ncoemployee and allegations of intentional conduct. It is\nundisputed that claimant did not seek or obtain the carrier's\nconsent or a compromise order before settling such action. Under\nsuch circumstances, the Board's determination that claimant\nforfeited future benefits by entering into the settlement without\nthe carrier's consent must be affirmed. The remaining issues\nwere not raised before the Board and, thus, are not preserved for\nour review (see Matter of Duncan v John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 137\nAD3d 1430, 1431 [2016]; Matter of Thomas-Fletcher v New York City\nDept. of Corr., 120 AD3d 867, 867 [2014]; Matter of Stewart v NYC\nTr.
