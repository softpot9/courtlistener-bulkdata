The BIA affirmed on that ground, finding\n\n    additionally that changed conditions in India would alternatively deny relief. We have\n\n    appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and will deny the petition.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n           Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we state the facts only as\n\n    they pertain to our analysis. Petitioner, a citizen of India, entered the United States on\n\n    March 10, 1992 without inspection. On August 7, 1992, he submitted an asylum\n\n    application stating he was a member of the All India Sikh Student Federation (\u201cAISSF\u201d)\n\n    in India, that he was responsible for new member recruitment, and that these activities\n\n    had prompted the Indian police to arrest and detain him on January 30, 1992. He stated\n\n    he was afraid to return to India because the police were still looking for him and he would\n\n    be arrested, tortured, and perhaps even killed if he returned. Petitioner supported his\n\n    application with several affidavits. Three affidavits were from friends of Petitioner who\n\n    had remained in India. Each attested that Petitioner was an active member of the AISSF\n\n    and that he was arrested on January 30, 1992. Additional affidavits from friends and\n\n    family living in the United States attested to the difficulties Petitioner would face as a\n\n    Sikh were he to return to India.\n\n           At his merits hearing on May 31, 2001, Petitioner testified that he was born in\n\n       1\n1        Petitioner did not appeal the IJ\u2019s denial of protection under the Convention Against\n2   Torture.\n\n                                                  2\n\fIndia, that he was a Sikh, and that, in India, he had owned his own farm, was married, and\n\nhad two children. Petitioner testified that his wife and two children stayed in India when\n\nhe left, and that he was now divorced. He testified that he joined the AISSF in 1987, that\n\nhe recruited new members and organized meetings, and that, as a result, he had been\n\narrested six times in those five years. He further testified that he had been abused during\n\none of these arrests. He showed a scar on his leg and introduced a letter from a physician\n\nstating the wound was the result of abuse. Petitioner also testified that he was forced to\n\ngo underground beginning in 1988, although between 1988 and 1992 he was still arrested\n\nfour times as a result of political activities such as participating in a public procession in\n\nJanuary, 1990.\n\n       At the merits hearing, Petitioner was asked about discrepancies between his\n\ntestimony and documents concerning his arrests, his application for asylum, his\n\nsupporting affidavits, his scar, and his subsequent medical treatment. In response, as to\n\nhis arrests, Petitioner testified that his lawyer mistakenly omitted five arrests from his\n\nasylum application in 1992, but Petitioner did not explain why his three affidavits from\n\nIndian friends all mentioned only the January 30, 1992 arrest that appeared in Petitioner\u2019s\n\nasylum application. As to his scar, Petitioner testified that, although his 1981 passport\n\nidentified the presence of a scar on his leg, the scar was nonetheless the result of abuse\n\nbecause Indian police beat the existing scar and made it worse. As to other discrepancies\n\nobserved by the IJ, Petitioner could not explain his lack of documentation corroborating\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fhis divorce, nor could Petitioner explain his lack of documentation with respect to his\n\nmembership in, or activities on behalf of, AISSF.\n\n       Petitioner did not call as witnesses any of his friends or family members living in\n\nAmerica who had provided additional supporting affidavits for his asylum application.\n\nHe only called himself as a witness.\n\n       At the conclusion of Petitioner\u2019s merits hearing, the IJ denied the applications for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture protection and granted\n\nPetitioner his alternative request for voluntary departure. The IJ found Petitioner was not\n\ncredible because his testimony was contradicted by Petitioner\u2019s documentation, not\n\ncorroborated by that documentation, and that, as a result, Petitioner had failed to meet his\n\nburden of proof. Appellant timely filed a petition for review with the BIA. On\n\nNovember 7, 2002, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on the ground that\n\nPetitioner lacked credibility due to the inconsistencies identified in the IJ\u2019s decision. The\n\nBIA alternatively found that Petitioner would have been ineligible for relief in light of\n\nchanged conditions in India. The BIA dismissed the appeal.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       When the BIA defers to the findings and decision of an IJ, we look to the\n\nreasoning of the IJ in our review of that decision. Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 F.3d 228, 244 (3d\n\nCir. 2003) (en banc). Thus, we review the IJ\u2019s credibility determination to determine\n\nwhether it is supported by substantial evidence in the record. See INS v. Elias-Zacarias,\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f    502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992); Gao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 272 (3d Cir. 2002).\n\n    \u201c\u2018Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a\n\n    reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d Senathirajah v. INS,\n\n    157 F.3d 210, 216 (3d Cir. 1998) (quoting Turcios v. INS, 821 F.2d 1396, 1398 (9th Cir.\n\n    1987)). An adverse credibility determination must be upheld unless \u201cany reasonable\n\n    adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B);\n\n    see also Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481-484. Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s\n\n    adverse credibility determination.\n\n                                                III.\n\n           Given the above standard, we are unable to say that a reasonable fact finder would\n\n    have been compelled to conclude to the contrary of the IJ\u2019s decision. The IJ reasonably\n\n    concluded that Petitioner\u2019s testimony was incredible in light of several material\n\n    inconsistencies that, together, were fatal to Petitioner\u2019s claims. \u201cAliens have the burden\n\n    of supporting their asylum claims through credible testimony.\u201d Gao, 299 F.3d at 272.2\n\n    Here, the IJ\u2019s findings were based on material discrepancies between Petitioner\u2019s\n\n    testimony, his asylum application, affidavits, and other supporting documents. The IJ\n\n    found that several of these discrepancies went to the heart of Petitioner\u2019s application. In\n\n    making these findings, the IJ appropriately relied upon the record. First, Petitioner\n\n\n\n       2\n1        Petitioner bears the burden of establishing eligibility for relief from removal. See 8\n2   C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13 (asylum); Mendoza v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (3d Cir.\n3   2003) (withholding of removal).\n\n                                                 5\n\ftestified he was a member of the AISSF in India for almost five years, yet he could\n\nproduce no document to corroborate this testimony. Petitioner could not explain why he\n\nlacked such corroborating evidence, even though he testified to having several lines of\n\ncommunication open to India, through friends and family still living there, including his\n\nex-wife, with whom Petitioner testified he communicated frequently.\n\n       Second, while Petitioner testified he had been arrested six times during those five\n\nyears for AISSF related activities, this testimony was contradicted in several ways.\n\nAmong them, his application for asylum, and three of the affidavits supporting that\n\napplication, stated that Petitioner was arrested only once, on January 30, 1992, while none\n\nof Petitioner\u2019s other affidavits or documents supported Petitioner\u2019s testimony of multiple\n\narrests. As for his asylum application, Petitioner testified that the five omitted arrests\n\nwere his lawyer\u2019s mistake. Yet even were that so, it would not explain the unanimity of\n\nthe three affidavits from India on the point, which all stated Petitioner was arrested only\n\nthe one time, on January 30, 1992. Petitioner\u2019s testimony about these other arrests was\n\nfurther undermined because while he testified that he went into underground hiding for\n\nsafety in the period 1988 to 1992, he also testified that he was arrested four times in those\n\nsame years for participating in public AISSF events.\n\n       Third, Petitioner\u2019s testimony that he was beaten during one of these arrests in the\n\nyears between 1987 and 1992 was undermined by his own passport, dated 1981, which\n\nalready identified the scar Petitioner claims is evidence of abuse that occurred years later.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fIt was reasonable for the IJ to find incredible Petitioner\u2019s claim that Indian police beat\n\nhim only in the exact place of this one existing scar, especially given that Petitioner\u2019s\n\ndocumentary evidence of medical treatment was created in 2000, and not\n\ncontemporaneously with treatment Petitioner claimed to receive for the injury in 1992.\n\n       Based upon these factors, the IJ was well within the bounds of his discretion to\n\nfind Petitioner lacked credibility. A review of the IJ\u2019s analysis and reasoning confirms\n\nthat these discrepancies go to the heart of Petitioner\u2019s claim of whether, as a Sikh, he\n\nsuffered political prosecution. The IJ provided concrete, specific, and cogent reasons for\n\nhis adverse credibility findings in the critical subject areas of Petitioner\u2019s alleged arrests\n\nand injury arising from his political activities, based upon careful consideration of\n\nPetitioner\u2019s testimony, his asylum application, his accompanying affidavits, and his\n\nsupporting documentation. See Senathirajah, 157 F.3d at 216 (an IJ must provide\n\n\u201cspecific, cogent\u201d reasons for credibility determinations based upon valid grounds). As\n\nsuch, the IJ\u2019s determination that Petitioner was not credible is therefore supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.

The BIA affirmed on that ground, finding\n\n    additionally that changed conditions in India would alternatively deny relief. We have\n\n    appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and will deny the petition.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n           Because we write solely for the benefit of the parties, we state the facts only as\n\n    they pertain to our analysis. Petitioner, a citizen of India, entered the United States on\n\n    March 10, 1992 without inspection. On August 7, 1992, he submitted an asylum\n\n    application stating he was a member of the All India Sikh Student Federation (\u201cAISSF\u201d)\n\n    in India, that he was responsible for new member recruitment, and that these activities\n\n    had prompted the Indian police to arrest and detain him on January 30, 1992. He stated\n\n    he was afraid to return to India because the police were still looking for him and he would\n\n    be arrested, tortured, and perhaps even killed if he returned. Petitioner supported his\n\n    application with several affidavits. Three affidavits were from friends of Petitioner who\n\n    had remained in India. Each attested that Petitioner was an active member of the AISSF\n\n    and that he was arrested on January 30, 1992. Additional affidavits from friends and\n\n    family living in the United States attested to the difficulties Petitioner would face as a\n\n    Sikh were he to return to India.\n\n           At his merits hearing on May 31, 2001, Petitioner testified that he was born in\n\n       1\n1        Petitioner did not appeal the IJ\u2019s denial of protection under the Convention Against\n2   Torture.\n\n                                                  2\n\fIndia, that he was a Sikh, and that, in India, he had owned his own farm, was married, and\n\nhad two children. Petitioner testified that his wife and two children stayed in India when\n\nhe left, and that he was now divorced. He testified that he joined the AISSF in 1987, that\n\nhe recruited new members and organized meetings, and that, as a result, he had been\n\narrested six times in those five years. He further testified that he had been abused during\n\none of these arrests. He showed a scar on his leg and introduced a letter from a physician\n\nstating the wound was the result of abuse. Petitioner also testified that he was forced to\n\ngo underground beginning in 1988, although between 1988 and 1992 he was still arrested\n\nfour times as a result of political activities such as participating in a public procession in\n\nJanuary, 1990.\n\n       At the merits hearing, Petitioner was asked about discrepancies between his\n\ntestimony and documents concerning his arrests, his application for asylum, his\n\nsupporting affidavits, his scar, and his subsequent medical treatment. In response, as to\n\nhis arrests, Petitioner testified that his lawyer mistakenly omitted five arrests from his\n\nasylum application in 1992, but Petitioner did not explain why his three affidavits from\n\nIndian friends all mentioned only the January 30, 1992 arrest that appeared in Petitioner\u2019s\n\nasylum application. As to his scar, Petitioner testified that, although his 1981 passport\n\nidentified the presence of a scar on his leg, the scar was nonetheless the result of abuse\n\nbecause Indian police beat the existing scar and made it worse. As to other discrepancies\n\nobserved by the IJ, Petitioner could not explain his lack of documentation corroborating\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fhis divorce, nor could Petitioner explain his lack of documentation with respect to his\n\nmembership in, or activities on behalf of, AISSF.\n\n       Petitioner did not call as witnesses any of his friends or family members living in\n\nAmerica who had provided additional supporting affidavits for his asylum application.\n\nHe only called himself as a witness.\n\n       At the conclusion of Petitioner\u2019s merits hearing, the IJ denied the applications for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture protection and granted\n\nPetitioner his alternative request for voluntary departure. The IJ found Petitioner was not\n\ncredible because his testimony was contradicted by Petitioner\u2019s documentation, not\n\ncorroborated by that documentation, and that, as a result, Petitioner had failed to meet his\n\nburden of proof. Appellant timely filed a petition for review with the BIA. On\n\nNovember 7, 2002, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on the ground that\n\nPetitioner lacked credibility due to the inconsistencies identified in the IJ\u2019s decision. The\n\nBIA alternatively found that Petitioner would have been ineligible for relief in light of\n\nchanged conditions in India. The BIA dismissed the appeal.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       When the BIA defers to the findings and decision of an IJ, we look to the\n\nreasoning of the IJ in our review of that decision.

An adverse credibility determination must be upheld unless \u201cany reasonable\n\n    adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B);\n\n    see also Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at 481-484. Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s\n\n    adverse credibility determination.\n\n                                                III.\n\n           Given the above standard, we are unable to say that a reasonable fact finder would\n\n    have been compelled to conclude to the contrary of the IJ\u2019s decision. The IJ reasonably\n\n    concluded that Petitioner\u2019s testimony was incredible in light of several material\n\n    inconsistencies that, together, were fatal to Petitioner\u2019s claims. \u201cAliens have the burden\n\n    of supporting their asylum claims through credible testimony.\u201d Gao, 299 F.3d at 272.2\n\n    Here, the IJ\u2019s findings were based on material discrepancies between Petitioner\u2019s\n\n    testimony, his asylum application, affidavits, and other supporting documents. The IJ\n\n    found that several of these discrepancies went to the heart of Petitioner\u2019s application. In\n\n    making these findings, the IJ appropriately relied upon the record. First, Petitioner\n\n\n\n       2\n1        Petitioner bears the burden of establishing eligibility for relief from removal. See 8\n2   C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13 (asylum); Mendoza v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76142\"><a href=\"/opinion/76142/sergio-leonel-mendoze-v-us-attorney-general-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287 (3d Cir.\n3   2003) (withholding of removal).\n\n                                                 5\n\ftestified he was a member of the AISSF in India for almost five years, yet he could\n\nproduce no document to corroborate this testimony. Petitioner could not explain why he\n\nlacked such corroborating evidence, even though he testified to having several lines of\n\ncommunication open to India, through friends and family still living there, including his\n\nex-wife, with whom Petitioner testified he communicated frequently.\n\n       Second, while Petitioner testified he had been arrested six times during those five\n\nyears for AISSF related activities, this testimony was contradicted in several ways.\n\nAmong them, his application for asylum, and three of the affidavits supporting that\n\napplication, stated that Petitioner was arrested only once, on January 30, 1992, while none\n\nof Petitioner\u2019s other affidavits or documents supported Petitioner\u2019s testimony of multiple\n\narrests. As for his asylum application, Petitioner testified that the five omitted arrests\n\nwere his lawyer\u2019s mistake. Yet even were that so, it would not explain the unanimity of\n\nthe three affidavits from India on the point, which all stated Petitioner was arrested only\n\nthe one time, on January 30, 1992. Petitioner\u2019s testimony about these other arrests was\n\nfurther undermined because while he testified that he went into underground hiding for\n\nsafety in the period 1988 to 1992, he also testified that he was arrested four times in those\n\nsame years for participating in public AISSF events.\n\n       Third, Petitioner\u2019s testimony that he was beaten during one of these arrests in the\n\nyears between 1987 and 1992 was undermined by his own passport, dated 1981, which\n\nalready identified the scar Petitioner claims is evidence of abuse that occurred years later.\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\fIt was reasonable for the IJ to find incredible Petitioner\u2019s claim that Indian police beat\n\nhim only in the exact place of this one existing scar, especially given that Petitioner\u2019s\n\ndocumentary evidence of medical treatment was created in 2000, and not\n\ncontemporaneously with treatment Petitioner claimed to receive for the injury in 1992.\n\n       Based upon these factors, the IJ was well within the bounds of his discretion to\n\nfind Petitioner lacked credibility. A review of the IJ\u2019s analysis and reasoning confirms\n\nthat these discrepancies go to the heart of Petitioner\u2019s claim of whether, as a Sikh, he\n\nsuffered political prosecution. The IJ provided concrete, specific, and cogent reasons for\n\nhis adverse credibility findings in the critical subject areas of Petitioner\u2019s alleged arrests\n\nand injury arising from his political activities, based upon careful consideration of\n\nPetitioner\u2019s testimony, his asylum application, his accompanying affidavits, and his\n\nsupporting documentation. See Senathirajah, 157 F.3d at 216 (an IJ must provide\n\n\u201cspecific, cogent\u201d reasons for credibility determinations based upon valid grounds). As\n\nsuch, the IJ\u2019s determination that Petitioner was not credible is therefore supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. See Abdulrahman, 330 F.3d at 597 (affording substantial deference\n\nto a finding grounded in evidence in the record).\n\n       Because Petitioner did not testify credibly, he failed to carry his burden of proof\n\nand establish eligibility for asylum or withholding from removal. As such, Petitioner\u2019s\n\nlack of credibility is an adequate ground for denying the petition, and we need not reach\n\nthe BIA\u2019s alternative holding that, even were Petitioner credible, he would be ineligible\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f    for relief due to changed conditions in India. See Dia, 353 F.3d at 247 (\u201cAn alien\u2019s\n\n    credibility, by itself, may satisfy his burden, or doom his claim.\u201d). 3\n\n           Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, we will deny the Petition.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n1       For this reason, we do not reach Petitioner\u2019s contention that the BIA\u2019s alternative\n2   ground for denying relief, based upon a 1999 country report provided by the State\n3   Department, was a violation of due process.\n\n                                                   8\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
