Introduction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hillsdale College is a private, nonsectarian, coeducational college located in Hillsdale, Michigan with an enrollment of approximately 1,000 students.  Since its founding in 1844, Hillsdale College has refused to accept any federal or state aid.  Certain of its students, however, individually secure loans or grants to pay the costs of their education under four federal programs:  the National Direct Student Loan (\"NDSL\") Program,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant (\"BEOG\") Program,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the Supplementary Educational Opportunity (\"SEOG\") Program,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and the Guaranteed Student Loan (\"GSL\") Program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   In the year ending June 30, 1978, approximately one-fourth of Hillsdale's student body received aid under these loan and grant programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title IX, enacted into law on June 23, 1972, is designed to prevent sex discrimination in federally assisted education programs and activities.  Section 901(a) of Title IX provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681(a) (1976).  Section 902 of Title IX, which provides for the enforcement of Section 901, authorizes HEW to issue regulations to implement Section 901 and to enforce such regulations by administrative enforcement proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   The ultimate sanction for noncompliance is the termination of federal assistance to any program in which noncompliance is found.  Section 903, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1683 (1976), provides for judicial review of any department or agency action taken pursuant to Section 902.  These sections of Title IX were derived from the virtually identical language of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits race discrimination in federally assisted programs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 4, 1975, HEW issued final regulations to \"effectuate Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972....\"  34 C.F.R. Sec. 106.1 (1981).  The portions of the regulations at issue in this case deal with the definitions of \"recipient\" and \"federal financial assistance.\"    Section 106.2(g)(1)(ii) defines \"federal financial assistance\" to include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scholarships, loans, grants, wages or other funds extended to any entity for payment to or on behalf of students admitted to that entity, or extended directly to such students for payment to that entity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"recipient\" is defined in the regulations to mean:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>[A]ny State or political subdivision thereof, or any instrumentality of a State or political subdivision thereof, any public or private agency, institution, or organization, or other entity, or any person, to whom Federal financial assistance is extended directly or through another recipient and which operates an education program or activity which receives or benefits from such assistance, including any subunit, successor, assignee, or transferee thereof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">34 C.F.R. Sec. 106.2(h) (1981) (emphasis added).  An exception to this definition is found in 34 C.F.R. Sec. 106.2(g)(5) (1981) which, in accordance with Section 902 of Title IX, exempts financial assistance in the form of contracts of insurance or guaranty from the enforcement authority of HEW.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations, under Section 106.4(a), further provide that each \"recipient\" of \"federal financial assistance,\" as defined above, must submit to HEW an \"Assurance of Compliance\" with Title IX, stating that each education program or activity operated by the institution to which the regulations apply will be conducted in compliance with Title IX and the regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Hillsdale College refused to execute such an Assurance of Compliance, HEW instituted these proceedings.  Hillsdale's basic arguments as to why the order cutting off funds is invalid are as follows.  First, it argues that, because it does not operate any \"education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\" 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681(a) (1976), it is not a \"recipient\" of such assistance within the meaning of Title IX and therefore, contrary to the regulations, is not covered by Title IX at all.  Stated slightly differently, Hillsdale contends that the receipt by its students of federal financial assistance does not make it, the institution, a \"recipient\" under Title IX.  Second, Hillsdale argues that the federal loans and grants cannot be terminated because of its failure to sign an Assurance of Compliance with Title IX regulations since enforcement under Title IX is \"program-specific\" and it can be required to assure compliance only as to programs actually receiving federal assistance.  Implicit in this argument is the proposition that it is, at the most, subject to regulation under Title IX only as to its administration of the student loan and grant programs.  While recognizing that under the Assurance the recipient agrees only to comply with the regulations to the extent applicable to it, Hillsdale points out that it is HEW's very theory that the entire institution is subject to such regulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>   Third, Hillsdale argues that termination of federal assistance, under the statute, cannot in any event be done unless there has been a showing of actual sex discrimination in the program receiving federal assistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The ALJ Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matter was referred to an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") upon a joint stipulation of facts and, on August 23, 1978, the ALJ issued his Initial Decision denying HEW's request for an order terminating federal financial assistance to Hillsdale's students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ initially found that, under the definitions set forth in the regulations, the payments by HEW to the students under the NDSL, SEOG, and BEOG programs constituted federal financial assistance received by Hillsdale:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>The financial assistance helps students pay for their education at Hillsdale by defraying their costs of tuition, books, room and board and other expenses incurred in attending Hillsdale.  Since funds are provided which Hillsdale would otherwise have to supply from its own resources, the total funds available to Hillsdale to carry on its education programs will also allow students to attend Hillsdale who would otherwise not have the financial means to do so, and so enlarge the population on which Hillside can draw for students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This finding by the ALJ that Hillsdale was a recipient of federal financial assistance under the regulations and Title IX was held to be \"persuasively supported\" by the case of Bob Jones University v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1872991\"><a href=\"/opinion/1872991/bob-jones-university-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></a></span> (D.S.C.1974), aff'd without opinion, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"332540\"><a href=\"/opinion/332540/bob-jones-university-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1975).    Bob Jones arose under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and involved the payment of veterans' benefits to veterans attending Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina.  The University, which had a policy of denying admission to unmarried nonwhite students for religious reasons, refused to sign an Assurance of Compliance with Title VI.  As a result, all VA assistance to the University was terminated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in Bob Jones upheld the termination, finding the veterans' benefits to be federal financial assistance \"received\" by the University.  396 F.Supp. at 601-602.  In addition, the court held that the veterans' payments were \"specifically tied to the beneficiary's participation in an educational program or activity,\" equating the statutory phrase \"program or activity\" with the entire institution.  Id. at 602.  Relying on such language, the ALJ found that, insofar as the federal grant and loan monies \"received\" by Hillsdale were not earmarked for specific programs but were utilized for general educational purposes, the institution as a whole was being financially supported through the payments made by the students under the federal programs.  Consequently, the ALJ concluded, \"it is the entire entity, Hillsdale College, which must vouch that each education program or activity operated by it will be operated in compliance with Title IX.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the ALJ found Hillsdale, as an institution, to be a recipient of federal financial assistance by virtue of the student aid programs, the College was not required by the ALJ to sign the Assurance of Compliance.  The ALJ noted that the Assurance of Compliance imposed a contractual duty on Hillsdale to comply with Title IX and Title IX regulations.  Because several courts, including this court, had held that the regulations found at 34 C.F.R. Secs. 106.51-106.61 (1981), relating to the prohibition of sex discrimination in employment, were invalid,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> the ALJ held that under such circumstances, it would be an abuse of discretion and arbitrary and capricious to grant the relief requested by HEW.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Reviewing Authority Decision</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HEW and Hillsdale both filed exceptions to the ALJ's Initial Decision with the HEW Reviewing Authority, Civil Rights.  On October 25, 1979 the Reviewing Authority denied Hillsdale's exceptions and granted HEW's exceptions in part, upholding the ruling of the ALJ that the Title IX regulations deeming Hillsdale to be a recipient of federal financial assistance are not in excess of the statutory authority granted HEW by Congress.  The Reviewing Authority, however, rejected the ALJ's holding that Hillsdale cannot be required to sign the Assurance of Compliance in light of the fact that several courts had found part of the Title IX regulations to be invalid.

Issues on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously stated, Hillsdale College is presently before this court seeking review of the Order of the HEW Reviewing Authority requiring it to execute the Assurance of Compliance in order to remain eligible for federal financial assistance to its students.  Under the facts presented, two major issues are before this court:  (1) whether the regulations, by deeming Hillsdale College to be a \"recipient\" of federal financial assistance subject to Title IX by virtue of the receipt of its students of federal grants and loans, exceed the statutory authority granted HEW by Congress, and (2) whether HEW in any event can insist on the execution of the Assurance of Compliance as a condition precedent for the continuation of federal student assistance programs at Hillsdale College.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>   We determine that Hillsdale is a \"recipient\" within the meaning of Title IX but that the regulations are invalid to the extent that they purport to subject Hillsdale College as an institution to the strictures of Title IX.  Specifically, we conclude that the regulations, as applied in this instance, contravene the program-specific nature of Title IX by equating the statutory phrase \"education program and activity\" with the educational institution itself.  We reach this conclusion after examining the statutory language of Title IX, its legislative history, and the relevant case law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Statutory Language of Title IX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two core provisions of Title IX, Sections 901 and 902, both contain express references to the program-specific focus of the statute.  As noted by the Supreme Court in North Haven, Section 901 sets forth the statute's program-specific prohibition of gender discrimination, while Section 902 relates to enforcement, providing for termination of federal funds or denial of future grants as the ultimate sanction for noncompliance so long as the termination or refusal \"is limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which noncompliance has been so found....\"  20 U.S.C. Sec. 1682 (1976).  See North Haven, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>at 514, 102 S.Ct. at 1914, 72 L.Ed.2d at 304.  The Court in North Haven relied on the existence of program-specific language in both the funding termination provision of Section 902 and the portion of Section 902 authorizing the issuance of implementing regulations<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> to reject the implicit view of the lower court that HEW's authority to issue regulations is broader than its enforcement authority, noting that \"it makes little sense to interpret the statute ... to authorize an agency to promulgate rules it cannot enforce.\"    Id. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>at 537, 102 S.Ct. at 1926, 72 L.Ed.2d at 318.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although stressing the requirement that Title IX regulations conform to the program-specific nature of the statute, the Supreme Court in North Haven, as previously stated, expressly declined to define the term \"program.\"    It is the position of HEW that, when an educational institution \"receives\" federal financial assistance by virtue of the receipt by its students of federal grants and loans, the entire educational institution constitutes a single \"education program or activity.\"    20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681(a) (1976).  Specifically, HEW asserts that since \"significant\" portions of the loan and grant monies provided to the students at Hillsdale are used to pay tuition, which generally supports the College as a whole, the College itself is the relevant \"education program and activity\" receiving federal financial assistance and thus the entire College may be regulated under Title IX consistently with the statute's program-specific mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the statutory language of Title IX does not bear out HEW's proposed expansive reading of the phrase \"education program or activity.\"    Initially, it should be pointed out that neither the term \"educational institution\" nor any equivalent term appears in Title IX's general prohibition, implementation, or enforcement provisions.  Instead, in each instance, the phrase \"education program or activity\" is used.  The term \"educational institution\" does however appear throughout the statutory exceptions to the general prohibition against sex discrimination set out in Section 901,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> and is defined at Section 901(c) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c) For purposes of this chapter an educational institution means any public or private preschool, elementary, or secondary school, or any institution of vocational, professional, or higher education, except that in the case of an educational institution composed of more than one school, college, or department which are administratively separate units, such term means each such school, college, or department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">20 U.S.C.

The appellant in Rice, a female law student at Harvard Law School, had brought suit under, inter alia, Title IX claiming sex discrimination in the awarding of grades at Harvard Law School.  Because she had not specified any federally funded program in which she suffered discrimination on the basis of sex, the appellant argued that Harvard Law School should be deemed the relevant \"education program\" by virtue of its status as a recipient of federal funds for its work study program.  No allegation of discrimination, however, was made concerning the School's handling of the work study program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held that the appellant failed to bring herself within the protection of Title IX.  Finding that Congress had \"obviously recognized that an educational institution offers a number of education programs and activities,\" the court concluded that \"the only meaningful interpretation of [20 U.S.C.] Sec. 1681(a) is that it prohibits sex discrimination in a federally funded education program offered by an educational institution.\"    663 F.2d at 338.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Legislative History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Circuit's conclusion in Rice that Congress, in passing Title IX, did not equate \"education program\" with \"educational institution\" is supported by an examination of the statute's legislative history.  The legislative history of Title IX and Title VI, upon which Title IX is based,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> supports the position taken by Hillsdale that Congress adopted a programmatic as opposed to an institutional approach to the problem of sex discrimination in education.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title IX originated in a floor amendment to S. 659, 92d CONG., 1st SESS.  (1971) (Education Amendments of 1971) sponsored by Senator Bayh.  As originally introduced, Senator Bayh's amendment read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>No person in the United States shall, on the ground of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of or be subject to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by a public institution of higher education, or any school or department of graduate education, which is a recipient of Federal financial assistance for any education program or activity....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">117 CONG.REC. 30156 (1971).  This amendment embodied an institutional approach as it would regulate all operations of an educational institution which received federal assistance for any of its programs or activities.  The amendment, however, was ruled to be nongermane to the bill under consideration and defeated.  117 CONG.REC. 30415 (1971).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February, 1972 the provision ultimately enacted as Title IX was introduced in the Senate by Senator Bayh during debate on the Education Amendments of 1972.  118 CONG.REC. 5803 (1972).  The institutional approach of the original proposal was replaced by the program-specific language presently contained in Sections 901 and 902.  No explanation or discussion was given for the change of approach.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a>   The Senate adopted the amendment and, on June 8, 1972, Congress passed the provisions as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  The measure was signed into law by the President on June 23, 1972.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of Title IX is sparse.  Because the statute is a result of a floor amendment, there are no committee reports discussing its provisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>   The Supreme Court in North Haven, however, found the shift in approach from the 1971 amendment to the 1972 amendment to be significant:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title IX's legislative history corroborates its general program-specificity.  Congress failed to adopt proposals that would have prohibited all discriminatory practices of an institution that receives federal funds.  See 117 Cong.Rec. 30155-30157, 30408 (1971) (Sen.  Bayh's 1971 amendment) ....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">North Haven, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>at 537, 102 S.Ct. at 1926, 72 L.Ed.2d at 318 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It thus appears clear that Title IX as enacted adopts the programmatic as opposed to institutional approach to discrimination on the basis of sex in education.  This conclusion, however, is not dispositive of the issue of whether the regulations are inconsistent with the program-specific nature of Title IX to the extent they deem Hillsdale College to be a recipient of federal financial assistance by virtue of the federal aid provided its students.  Although conceding that the effect of its assertion that Hillsdale College itself is the relevant \"education program or activity\" is to subject the entire College to regulation, HEW contends that such a position is not institutional, since it does not attempt to regulate programs not receiving federal funds, as the original version of Title IX attempted, but instead is programmatic, with the entire College constituting the relevant \"education program.\"    Hence it is necessary to determine whether Congress intended entire educational institutions to be regulated under the phrase \"education program or activity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As previously noted, there is no explicit language in Title IX which supports HEW's position that an entire institution can constitute an \"education program or activity.\"    See Rice v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, supra.    As noted by one commentator, the term \"program\" was used in the Congressional debates preceding passage of Title IX \"to refer not to the total program of an educational institution but to smaller-scale activities within the institution.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>   In Board of Public Instruction v. Finch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"286131\"><a href=\"/opinion/286131/board-of-public-instruction-of-taylor-county-florida-v-robert-h-finch/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1969), the Fifth Circuit similarly relied on the legislative history of Title VI to reject HEW's assertion that the term \"program\" in Section 601 of Title VI, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000d (1976), referred to general categories such as \"school programs.\"    The Court in Finch instead equated \"program\" with \"federal grant statute,\" relying on the manner in which the term \"program\" was used during the debates on Title VI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we find that the legislative histories of Title VI and Title IX reveal no indication that Congress contemplated that an entire educational institution could constitute a single \"program or activity.\"    We further find that the position asserted by HEW is inconsistent with the program-specific nature of Title IX insofar as its practical effect would be to circumvent the programmatic focus of the statute and adopt the institutional approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Case Law</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inconsistency between equating \"educational institution\" with \"education program or activity\" and the program-specific nature of Title IX was discussed in Bennett v. West Texas State University, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1692362\"><a href=\"/opinion/1692362/bennett-v-west-texas-state-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span> (N.D.Tex.1981), appeal docketed, No. 81-1398 (5th Cir.  Aug. 28, 1981). Bennett involved allegations by female students of West Texas State University that various policies and practices of the University discriminated against women on the basis of sex by denying women equal opportunities in the University's intercollegiate athletic program in violation of Title IX.  The University contended, and the district court held, that the regulations exceeded the statutory authority granted under Title IX to the extent they purported to apply to the University's intercollegiate athletic program irrespective of the absence of direct federal financial assistance to that specific program.  525 F.Supp. at 78-80.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a>   In addition, the district court held in Bennett that the University's athletic program did not receive direct federal financial assistance by virtue of the fact that University students received veterans' benefits, BEOG grants, work study money, and other federal financial aid.  The plaintiffs' argument, identical to the argument raised by HEW in the instant case, was that the University's athletic program received federal financial assistance because the University received tuition from students that was supplied as grants or loans under the federal programs.  The court's rationale for rejecting this argument is equally applicable to the case at hand:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' argument that such aid constitutes a direct benefit to the athletics programs is not well-taken.  All types of federal aid enumerated by the Plaintiffs are general and nonspecific, and such aid is indirect by nature.  The type of assistance relied on by Plaintiffs results in some benefit, however remote and indirect, to every program at West Texas State University.  Were the Court to adopt Plaintiffs' argument, the programmatic construction of Title IX would be rendered nugatory, because every program or activity at the university would be subject to Title IX.    The Act itself compels a different conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 80-81 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>   Under the position taken by the plaintiffs in Bennett and HEW in the instant case, every program or activity of an educational institution that accepts students who receive federal financial assistance would be subjected to regulation under Title IX.  If discrimination is found in a particular program or activity of the institution, such as the athletic program or the math department, the remedy, as sought in this instance by HEW, would be to terminate all student federal financial assistance.  For the reasons stated herein, we find HEW's position to be inconsistent with the program-specific language of Sections 901 and 902 of Title IX.  We further find that, to the extent the regulations adopt and effectuate HEW's position, they are in excess of statutory authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HEW and the Reviewing Authority rely primarily on the case of Bob Jones University v.

As a result, the order of the Veterans Administration terminating the right of eligible veterans seeking education at Bob Jones University to receive veterans' benefits was affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to follow the language in Bob Jones that an entire institution may be deemed the relevant \"program or activity\" to the extent that the language would purport to cover the circumstances of the case at hand.

In Othen v. Ann Arbor School Bd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251611\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251611/othen-v-ann-arbor-sch-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

April 22, 1981), the district court found that the court in Bob Jones did not have to decide which University programs or activities were racially discriminatory because the University's admissions policy \"tainted\" all programs:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Racial discrimination respecting acceptance or admission into educational institutions permeates all programs and activities within those institutions.  Once racially discriminatory admission policies have been found to exist, the taint of racial discrimination affects all programs and activities within the particular institution.  Therefore, the courts which have decided suits brought under Title VI did not have to carefully focus upon the institutional/programmatic conflict which is now squarely before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">507 F.Supp. at 1387.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>   In contrast, HEW argues here that the programs and activities of Hillsdale College may be subjected to Title IX because student federal financial assistance is used to pay tuition, which in turn flows to all operations of the College.  There is no allegation that the admissions policy at Hillsdale discriminates on the basis of sex;  in fact, there is no allegation that Hillsdale has discriminated on the basis of sex in any manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second feature of Bob Jones which distinguishes it from the present case concerns the constitutional dimension of the decision.  The court, after noting that \"[e]ach time the VA approves an application for benefits to be used at Bob Jones, it extends a benefit to whites which it cannot grant to some blacks,\" held that \"the federal government cannot, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, provide direct grants-in-aid to public or private entities which discriminate on the basis of race....\"  396 F.Supp. at 608 (emphasis in original).  Hence the decision in Bob Jones may fairly be read to have a constitutional underpinning above and beyond its statutory basis.  See Othen, supra, at 1389.  The position of HEW in the present case, in contrast, must rest on the statutory language of Title IX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Grove City College v.

This opinion relies in substantial measure on post-enactment legislative history.  We disagree with the holding in Grove City for the reasons heretofore indicated.  On the contrary, we are of the view that the \"program,\" within the meaning of Title IX, is the federal loan and grant program for students.  The reasoning of the majority in Grove City would equally apply if the federal government subsidized the athletic program at a college, allowing the college to use gate receipts to, for example, supplement faculty salaries and to create scholarships.  We do not believe that Congress intended, in enacting Title IX, to authorize HEW pervasively to regulate entire colleges and universities because federal money benefits the entire institution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>   Under the majority opinion in Grove City, the \"program-specific\" limitation set out by the Supreme Court in North Haven loses all of its practical meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The concurring judge (Judge Becker) in Grove City thought that the majority opinion was too broadly based, contending that the only issue presented was whether the college could be required to execute the Assurance of Compliance.  Judge Becker then asserts that the Assurance is itself program-specific, as is required by North Haven, because it applies, by its terms, only to an education program or activity for which the applicant receives or benefits from federal financial assistance.  687 F.2d at 705.  Thus Judge Becker concludes that the regulation requiring the Assurance is valid because the Assurance is limited to programs receiving benefits from the federal government.  The difficulty with Judge Becker's view is that it is HEW's very position that the entire college is a program and that by executing the Assurance, the college agrees to comply with regulations as they apply to the entire institution.  Simply stated, it appears to us that it would be anomalous to hold that the college may be required to execute the Assurance because it is so limited by its terms when HEW construes the Assurance and its regulations to apply to the college as an institution, a position that is, in our view, not supportable under Title IX.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.

This case involves interpretation of one of two principal pieces of legislation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> which Congress has yet adopted in order to grant equal rights to women.

Yet in this statute, Congress clearly intended to turn its back on that discreditable past.  And in two important cases, the Supreme Court (by breadth of interpretation of Title IX) and the Third Circuit (in a decision directly on point) have done likewise.   North Haven Bd. of Educ. v.

It has, however, taken a long time in the history of this country for women to be recognized as either \"persons\" or \"citizens\" in a constitutional and legal sense.

Flexner, Century of Struggle 15 (1974) quoting Adams, Familiar Letters, 149050.  In the original Constitution, adopted at Philadelphia and ratified in 1787, Article IV, Sec. 2, Clause 1 reads \"the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.\"    Despite Abigail's entreaties, however, the \"ladies\" went unremembered.  Just as blacks of that day whether freed or slave were not considered citizens for purpose of that grant of equality, so too, by common understanding, were women excluded, albeit, not by any specific constitutional language.  When four years later, the new country enacted Amendment V of the Bill of Rights, it decreed as to all persons in the nation \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without the due process of law.\"    While the rights of women to due process of law in matters involving charges of crime or cases involving disputes over property were gradually established (largely as a result of the common laws' impact on the laws of the various states) they were still not considered \"persons\" or \"citizens\" in a full constitutional sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Women were called \"persons\" and \"citizens\" by the Court, but they were still not afforded full constitutional rights, particularly political rights, belonging to male persons or male citizens.  For example the Dred Scott decision described the woman as \"citizen\" and referred to her as a person but treated her as a political eunuch.  In the words of that Court, \"Undoubtedly, a person may be a citizen, that is a member of the community who form the sovereignty although he exercises no share of the political power, and is incapacitated from holding particular offices.  Women and minors, who form a part of the political family cannot vote ... yet they are citizens.\"   Dred Scott v.

It read:All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.  No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges and immunities of any citizen of the United States nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction, the equal protection of the laws.\"    U.S. Constitution, Amendment XIV, Sec. 1 (Emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the face of this amendment, it would seem logical that women born or naturalized in the United States, were by virtue of the fourteenth amendment, citizens of the United States and of the states wherein they reside and consequently, that they could not be denied the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the most fundamental of the laws, however, were those which gave citizens the right to vote, yet the Supreme Court of 1874 had no trouble saying that no portion of the fourteenth amendment served to extend voting rights to women since they had never before had them.

Of course the fourteenth amendment could likewise have been regarded as a grant of voting rights to the freed slaves.  But that proposition seems to have been so far from public consciousness that in 1870 the fifteenth amendment was drafted and ratified in order specifically to accomplish that objective as to black males.  The fifteenth amendment reads:  \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\"    Efforts to add \"sex\" as a forbidden basis for exclusion from the right to vote were brushed aside, and the fifteenth amendment made no reference to any rights that women, black or white, might have.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact women were denied the right to vote in both local, state and national elections until the great women's suffrage movement secured another constitutional amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>   It was adopted and ratified in 1920.

We agree with HEW that funds may be cut off without a finding that a college is actually discriminating on the basis of sex.

We agree with Hillsdale's alternative contention that the entire college, as an institution, is not a \"program\" within the meaning of Title IX and that the \"program\" involved here is the student loan and grant program.

We agree with Hillsdale that the regulation requiring it to execute the Assurance of Compliance as a condition for its students receiving loans and grants is, as it is applied here, an invalid regulation.  This is true because the regulation and the Assurance, as interpreted and applied by HEW, cover the entire college and are not limited to the student loan and grant program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>Educational Activities as a Title IX \"Program\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal funding which is involved in this appeal consists of the receipt by Hillsdale of funds for the operation of the college from student fees paid as a result of four separate federal grant programs.  These are the National Direct Student Loan Program, hereinafter to be referred to as NDSL, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1087aa et seq.;    the Basic Educational Opportunity Grant Program, hereinafter BEOG, 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1070;  the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Program, hereinafter SEOG;  20 U.S.C. 1070(b) and the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, hereinafter GSL;  20 U.S.C. Sec. 1071 et seq.    Under two of these programs, NDSL and SEOG, the Department provides funds directly to Hillsdale College.  The college then distributes the funds in the form of scholarships to qualified students.  Portions of or all of such scholarship funds are then paid to the college by the students as tuition, room and board, etc.  Under the BEOG Program, HEW funds are provided directly to eligible students and are subsequently paid to Hillsdale for tuition, room and board, etc.  The GSL Program is distinct from the other three.  Under it students apply for low interest loans from private lending institutions.  The loans are guaranteed in whole or in part by the United States Government which pays interest on the loans throughout the student's education.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the programs referred to above require that Hillsdale certify that the student who is the ultimate recipient is enrolled in college.  Under two of the programs, NDSL and SEOG, HEW pays the funds directly to Hillsdale which then distributes the federal subsidies to qualified students.  Under BEOG, HEW funds are provided directly to eligible students who in turn use them to defray their college expenses.  HEW advises that in the year ending June 30, 1978 approximately one-fourth of the Hillsdale student body received aid under these various programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems clear to me that each of these programs provides funds which when paid to the college are used for the general support of the educational program of the college as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1681(a) of Title IX provides as follows:  \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance....\"  Under the circumstances outlined above, it seems obvious to me that Congress intended for its prohibition on sex discrimination to apply to a college like Hillsdale when it was \"receiving Federal financial assistance\" in the fashion Hillsdale is receiving such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the recent decision by the Supreme Court in North Haven Bd. of Educ. v.

Clearly the court's application of the sex discrimination ban to all employees of the school (including those not directly involved in the educational process)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> was a much wider interpretation of the statute than HEW has followed in our instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority opinion continued to find in the broad language of the sponsors of Title IX support for including employee discrimination within Title IX's prohibition of sex discrimination in educational activities.  Without repeating the Court's legislative history or its postenactment history, I incorporate Sections B and C of the majority opinion by reference and rely upon the majority's obvious inclination to give the statute its full intended effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I now turn to the Third Circuit's treatment of the identical problem which we face in our instant case.  There, as here, the educational institution concerned objected vigorously to any \"generalized nonprogrammatic, or institutional basis\" for Title IX application.

That result would be logically inconsistent.  Yet Grove City asks this court to decide that an institution whose entire purpose is educational is exempt from coverage when it is financed with federal funds that can be used for virtually any educational purpose instead of a clearly limited function.  The absurd result if this approach is followed to its logical conclusion is that general higher education aid would never bring the college under Title IX coverage because no specific program within the College would be earmarked to benefit from the federal funding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Grove City College v.

The enactment of Title IX in 1972 forbidding discrimination against women in education was patterned after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which proscribed discrimination in any federally assisted program on the basis of race, color, or national origin;  both statutes have parallel prohibitions and identical enforcement mechanisms similarly described.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a>   In fact, \"the drafters of Title IX explicitly assumed that it would be interpreted and applied as Title VI has been during the preceding eight years.\"   Cannon v.

Moreover the goals to which the statutes aspire are indeed similar.  \"Title IX, like its model Title VI, sought to accomplish two related, but nevertheless somewhat different, objectives.

Accordingly I suggest fund termination that will not affect students presently enrolled but only those who may enter in the future.  At issue in this regard could be severe impact upon the education of students who are not in any way responsible for this controversy.  Additionally it may well be that the college itself will see fit to comply with the agency's regulation at the beginning of the school year after the regulation's legality and constitutionality are completely established.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This less harsh prospective remedy appears to be consistent with the Title IX statutory scheme.

Sec. 1682 (1976), provides that compliance with the statute \"may be effected\" by termination of funding or \"by any other means authorized by law.\"    (emphasis added).  Agency adoption of the suggested equitable remedy would be one which is \"authorized by law\" and would fall within the permissive grant of authority to fashion remedies.

No such rule, regulation, or order shall become effective unless and until approved by the President.  Compliance with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected (1) by the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue assistance under such program or activity to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement, but such termination or refusal shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other recipient as to whom such a finding has been made, and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found, or (2) by any other means authorized by law....</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> 42 U.S.C.

The court cited the repeated references to particular federal programs in support of its conclusion:</p>\n        <p>An even more substantial objection to HEW's interpretation of the term \"program\" is provided by the use of that term during Congressional debates on the statute and by HEW's own use of the term in the administrative regulations issued thereunder.  In the Senate where the program limitation was initiated, reference was frequently made to the school lunch program, 110 Cong.Rec. 7101 (1964), to the agricultural extension program for home economics teachers, 110 Cong.Rec. 13126 (1964), to the farm-to-market road program, 110 Cong.Rec. 13331 (1964), to aid for vocational agriculture teaching, 110 Cong.Rec. 13126 (1964), and to aid to impacted school districts, 110 Cong.Rec. 7100 and 13126 (1964).  Senator Eastland went so far as to introduce in the Congressional Record a long list of the federal programs to which the cutoff provision was applicable, 110 Cong.Rec. 8359-8361 (1964), as did Congressmen Poff and Cramer in the House.  1964 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, pp. 2470-2473.  HEW in issuing regulations to implement the cutoff provision has followed a similar procedure.  See 45 C.F.R. Sec. 80.2 and 45 C.F.R. Sec. 80.13, Appendix A.  All of these lists refer to particular grant statutes such as those before us, not to a collective concept known as a school program or a road program.  Taken together they clearly contradict the notion that Congress intended the collectivization of all school subventions under the single rubric:  \"program or part thereof.\"</p>\n        <p>414 F.2d at 1077 (emphasis added).
