R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH\nCIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f    Case: 12-60638      Document: 00512709269   Page: 2   Date Filed: 07/23/2014\n\n\n                                 No. 12-60638\n\nCompany (\u201cDresser-Rand\u201d) committed numerous unfair labor practices, in\nviolation of the National Labor Relations Act, by locking out its employees in\nthe wake of a strike.\n      On appeal, Dresser-Rand argues that the Board\u2019s decision is invalid\nbecause, at the time it issued this ruling, it lacked a quorum. Specifically,\nDresser-Rand contends three of the five Board members were not properly\nappointed by the President.\n      In May 2013, the appeal was placed in abeyance pending a decision from\nthe U.S. Supreme Court in NLRB v. Noel Canning, 134 S. Ct. 2550 (2014). In\nJune 2014, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Noel Canning and agreed\nwith Dresser-Rand that the President\u2019s recess appointments to the Board were\nunconstitutional. Id. at 2578.\n      Dresser-Rand moves to lift the abeyance in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision. That motion is GRANTED.\n      The Board also filed a motion asking this Court to grant Dresser-Rand\u2019s\npetition, vacate the unconstitutionally constituted Board\u2019s decision, and to\nremand this case to the Board for further proceedings. The Board also asks\nthat the mandate issue expeditiously. Dresser-Rand opposes remand arguing\nall of the issues are fully briefed and ripe for review, and remand will add\nunnecessary delay.\n      The Board\u2019s request is consistent with our practice when the Board has\npreviously acted without lawful authority to render a decision. For example,\nin Bentonite Performance Mineral LLC v. NLRB, while the appeal was\npending, the Supreme Court decided that the then two-member Board lacked\nauthority adjudicate cases. 382 F. App\u2019x 402, 403 (5th Cir. 2010) (per curiam)\n(citing New Process Steel, L.P. v. NLRB, 560 U.S. 674 (2010)). We vacated the\nBoard\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings. Id.

Dresser-Rand\u2019s petition for\nreview is GRANTED, the order of the Board is VACATED, and the case is\nREMANDED to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nFurther, the Clerk of the Court is directed to issue the mandate expeditiously.\n       IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n       1 NLRB v.
