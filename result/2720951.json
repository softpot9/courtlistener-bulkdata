Prosecution case-in-chief.\n       a. Nicole S.6 (counts 1 through 4)\n       On June 19, 2012, Nicole and her friends were at a beach along Kings River in\nLaton, California. Defendant, who was driving a jet ski nearby, stopped, and asked,\n\u201c[w]ho wants a ride.\u201d One of Nicole\u2019s male companions asked for a ride. After they\nreturned, Nicole did not want to go for a ride, but \u201ceveryone [said] \u2026 go, go\u201d and\ndefendant said, \u201cyeah, come on,\u201d so Nicole got on the jet ski with defendant. Defendant\nhad Nicole ride in front of him. Defendant\u2019s hands were on the handlebars; the\nhandlebars included the throttle. The two headed down the river. When they reached a\nfork in the river, defendant tried to steer to the left, but Nicole took hold of the handlebars\nand steered to the right. By this time, she smelled alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath.\nDefendant pulled closer to Nicole, stated he was drunk, touched her waist, and asked,\n\u201cWhat are you going to do for me?\u201d She answered, \u201cWhat do you mean what am I going\nto do for you? You just gave him a ride, what did he do for you?\u201d Defendant replied,\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a bitch, what are you going to do for me?\u201d\n       Defendant and Nicole came to a weir located approximately three miles away\nfrom the beach. Defendant turned off the jet ski and groped Nicole\u2019s breasts, midsection,\nand buttocks. Nicole asked him what he was doing, and told him to stop. Defendant\nbecame increasingly \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cscary\u201d and Nicole fought him. Nicole turned on\nthe jet ski and attempted to maneuver the vehicle to get back to her friends. While doing\nso, defendant kissed her neck, placed his right hand inside her bikini bottom, and inserted\na finger into her vagina. Nicole continued to resist defendant as she drove the jet ski back\n\n\n6      Certain persons are identified by an abbreviated name in accordance with our\nSupreme Court\u2019s policy regarding protective nondisclosure of identity. No disrespect is\nintended.\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fto the beach. When they arrived, she disembarked and cried. She threw dirt at defendant.\nWhen asked why, she said, \u201cbecause he[ was] dirt.\u201d When defendant was questioned by\nNicole\u2019s friends, he remarked, \u201cWasn\u2019t that why I gave her a ride?\u201d\n       b. Carli R. (counts 5 through 8)\n       In June 2012, Carli and her girlfriends were floating down Kings River when they\nsaw defendant driving his jet ski. She asked him for a ride because she \u201cthought it would\nbe fun.\u201d Defendant and Carli headed north at a rate of roughly 10 to 15 miles per hour\nand reached an isolated part of the river with which she was unfamiliar. She \u201cfelt\nuncomfortable\u201d because they \u201cwere gone for too long.\u201d Carli asked defendant to switch\npositions so that she could sit in front and be able to drive \u201cjust in case.\u201d After the two\ntraded seats, he placed his hands on her inner thighs. Carli told defendant to stop and\nremoved his hands. He again placed his hands on her inner thighs and then rubbed her\ncrotch on the outside of her bathing suit for \u201c[a] good amount of time\u201d and \u201c[l]ong\nenough for [her] to get scared.\u201d Carli eventually drove the jet ski back to her friends.\nMeanwhile, defendant instructed her to explain \u201c[they] were gone so long because [they]\nwent such a far distance.\u201d After they returned, Carli gestured to her friends not to ride\nwith him.\nII.    Defense case-in-chief.\n       Defendant testified. Regarding Nicole, he stated she, and one of her male friends\nasked him for a ride on his jet ski. He gave a ride to the friend first and then to Nicole.\nShe sat in front, turned on the jet ski, and drove. By this time, defendant had consumed\napproximately eight cans of beer. He fell asleep during the ride, but awakened due to\nlower back pain. Defendant contemplated \u201cwhat kind of girl\u201d Nicole was and placed his\nhand on her lap. She removed his hand and said, \u201cNo.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cOh,\nwhat, I get nothing for the ride?\u201d Later, when he \u201cwas going to fall off\u201d the jet ski, he\nheld on to Nicole\u2019s midsection. Defendant only \u201cfelt the top of her waistband from her\n\n\n\n                                              4.\n\fbikini bottom.\u201d When the two returned to the beach, Nicole \u201cjumped off the jet ski and\nact[ed] like she was molested.\u201d\n       Regarding Carli, he stated she asked him for a ride on his jet ski because she was\ntired and he obliged. The pair headed upstream to see \u201cwhy the water [was] running so\nslow.\u201d At no point did Carli complain about the duration of this trip, which was\napproximately 20 minutes. Later, when she asked to drive the jet ski, defendant pulled\nover and switched seats. He then put his left hand on Carli\u2019s lap \u201cto see what kind of gal\u201d\nshe was. She \u201cbrushed it off and that was it.\u201d Defendant and Carli returned to her friends\nwithout any further incident.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\nI.     Substantial evidence supported defendant\u2019s convictions on counts 2 and 6 for\n       felony false imprisonment.\n       \u201cWhen an appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the reviewing court\nmust review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine\nwhether it contains substantial evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact could have\nfound the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (People v. Aispuro (2007) 157\nCal.App.4th 1509, 1511 (Aispuro); accord People v. Bolin (1998) 18 Cal.4th 297, 331.)\n\u201cReversal on this ground is unwarranted unless it appears \u2018that upon no hypothesis\nwhat[so]ever is there sufficient substantial evidence to support [the conviction].\u2019\n[Citation.]\u201d (People v. Bolin, supra, at p. 331.) \u201cFor evidence to be \u2018substantial\u2019 it must\nbe of ponderable legal significance, reasonable in nature, credible and of solid value.\u201d\n(Aispuro, supra, at p. 1511; accord People v. Johnson (1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 576.)\n\u201cAlthough we must ensure the evidence is reasonable, credible, and of solid value, \u2026 it is\nthe exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness\nand the truth or falsity of the facts on which that determination depends.\u201d (People v.\nJones (1990) 51 Cal.3d 294, 314.) \u201cThus, if the verdict is supported by substantial\n\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\fevidence, we must accord due deference to the trier of fact and not substitute our\nevaluation of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the fact finder.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       \u201cFalse imprisonment is the unlawful violation of the personal liberty of another.\u201d\n(\u00a7 236; see Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. (1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1123 [\u201c\u2018The tort of false\nimprisonment is the nonconsensual, intentional confinement of a person, without lawful\nprivilege, for an appreciable length of time, however short.\u2019\u201d].)7 \u201c\u2018In order to constitute a\ncase of false imprisonment, it is essential that there be some restraint of the person; but it\nis not necessary that there be confinement in a jail or prison.\u2019\u201d (People v. Agnew (1940)\n16 Cal.2d 655, 659; see People v. Dominguez (2010) 180 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1357 [\u201cFalse\nimprisonment does not require \u2018confinement in some type of enclosed space.\u2019\n[Citation.]\u201d].) \u201c\u2018Any exercise of force, or express or implied threat of force, by which in\nfact the other person is deprived of his liberty or is compelled to remain where he does\nnot wish to remain, or to go where he does not wish to go, is an imprisonment. The\nwrong may be committed by acts or by words, or both, and by merely operating upon the\nwill of the individual or by personal violence, or both.\u2019\u201d (People v. Agnew, supra, at\npp. 659-660; accord People v. Grant (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1105, 1112.) \u201c[F]alse\nimprisonment, whether misdemeanor or felony, is a general intent crime \u2026.\u201d (People v.\nOlivencia (1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1391, 1397.)\n       \u201cFalse imprisonment is a misdemeanor unless it is \u2018effected by violence, menace,\nfraud, or deceit,\u2019 in which case it is a felony.\u201d (People v. Wardell (2008) 162\nCal.App.4th 1484, 1490, quoting \u00a7 237.) \u201cMenace is defined as \u2018a verbal or physical\nthreat of harm. The threat of harm may be express or implied.\u2019\u201d (Aispuro, supra, 157\nCal.App.4th at p. 1512.) \u201cAn express or implied threat of harm does not require the use\n\n\n7      The Supreme Court has held that the definitions of the crime and tort are identical.\n(See, e.g., Hagberg v. California Federal Bank (2004) 32 Cal.4th 350, 372; Fermino v.\nFedco, Inc. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 701, 715.)\n\n\n\n                                               6.\n\fof a deadly weapon or an express verbal threat to do additional harm. Threats can be\nexhibited in a myriad number of ways, verbally and by conduct.\u201d (Id. at p. 1513.)\n       We conclude substantial evidence supported the conviction on count 2. Viewed in\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, the record demonstrated that defendant controlled\nthe jet ski as he and Nicole traveled down Kings River for about three miles. Before they\nreached the weir, he drew closer to her, touched her, and insinuated that he expected her\nto engage in lascivious conduct in exchange for the ride. When Nicole objected,\ndefendant called her a \u201cbitch\u201d and again suggested that he was owed sexual gratification.\nThereafter, he brought her to the weir, turned off the jet ski, and sexually abused her.\nBased on the evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, that defendant intentionally restrained Nicole against her will by menace.\nAlthough Nicole voluntarily boarded the jet ski at the outset, she did not wish to remain\nafter defendant revealed his lewd intention. She could not, however, immediately\ndismount the moving vehicle without exposing herself to injury. Moreover, defendant\nonly stopped and turned off the jet ski once he and Nicole reached a secluded area of the\nriver where she was separated from her friends and his implicit threat\u2014he would not\nbring her back until he got what he wanted\u2014became more tangible. A reasonable trier of\nfact also could have inferred from defendant\u2019s conduct his general intent to commit the\noffense. (See People v. Martinez (1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 859, 863-864.)\n       For analogous reasons, we conclude substantial evidence supported defendant\u2019s\nconviction on count 6. Defendant transported Carli upstream for 20 minutes to a remote\npart of the river with which she was unfamiliar and where she was separated from her\nfriends. Carli, who was uncomfortable by this point, wanted to return and switched\npositions with defendant to have easier access to the handlebars. Before she could act,\nhowever, he fondled her for an appreciable length of time. Based on these circumstances,\nincluding defendant\u2019s conduct and Carli\u2019s fear during the ordeal (see People v.

The trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements of felony false\n       imprisonment.\n       a. Background\n       After close of evidence, the trial court read CALCRIM No. 1240 to the jury:\n\n              \u201cThe defendant is charged in Count 2 and 6 with false imprisonment\n       by violence or menace in violation of Penal Code Section 237(a)[.] [\u00b6] To\n       prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that:\n\n              \u201c1.   The defendant intentionally restrained, or confined, or\n       detained someone by violence or menace; and\n\n              \u201c2.    The defendant made the other person stay or go somewhere\n       against the person\u2019s will.\n\n             \u201cViolence means using physical force that is greater than the force\n       reasonably necessary to restrain someone. [\u00b6] Menace means a verbal or\n       physical threat of harm. The threat of harm may be express or implied.\n\n             \u201cAn act is done against a person\u2019s will if that person does not\n       consent to the act. In order to consent, a person must act freely and\n       voluntarily and know the nature of the act.\u201d\n       b. Analysis\n       \u201c\u2018It is settled that in criminal cases, even when not requested, the court must\ninstruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence.\n[Citations.] The general principles of law governing the case are those principles closely\nand openly connected with the evidence adduced before the court which are necessary for\nthe jury\u2019s proper consideration of the case. [Citations.] At a minimum, it is the court\u2019s\nduty to ensure the jury is adequately instructed on the law governing all elements of the\ncase submitted to it to the extent necessary for a proper determination in conformity with\nthe applicable law. [Citation.]\u2019\u201d (People v. Haney (1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 308, 312\n\n                                             8.\n\f(Haney).) \u201c\u2018We presume jurors \u201cgenerally understand and follow instructions.\u201d\u2019\n[Citation.]\u201d (People v. Jackson (2014) 58 Cal.4th 724, 767.)\n       As to a charge of false imprisonment, the \u201c[i]nstructions essential to the jury\u2019s\nproper evaluation of the facts before them would encompass the following: [t]he crime\nof false imprisonment, whether misdemeanor or felony, requires for its commission some\nintended confinement or restraint of the person. It is not necessary there be confinement\nin jail or prison. Any exercise of force or express or implied threat of force by which in\nfact the person is restrained from his liberty, compelled to remain where he does not wish\nto remain, or to go where he does not wish to go, is such imprisonment. The\nimprisonment may be committed by acts or words merely operating on the will of the\nindividual and/or personal violence. The acts must be done, the words must be said, with\nthe intent of causing the confinement. [Citations.]\u201d (Haney, supra, 75 Cal.App.3d at\np. 313.) \u201cIf the imprisonment is effected without the use of violence, menace, fraud or\ndeceit, it is a misdemeanor. The presence of one or more of these elements elevates the\nfalse imprisonment to a felony.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       Here, the trial court read CALCRIM No. 1240 verbatim. (See Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 2.1050(e) [use of Judicial Council jury instructions \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d and\n\u201crecommended\u201d].) This pattern instruction incorporates the \u201cprimary element of \u2026\nunlawful restraint of another\u2019s liberty\u201d (Haney, supra, 75 Cal.App.3d at p. 313) and\n\u201cfocuses on the use of violence or menace to restrain the victim\u201d (Com. to CALCRIM\nNo. 1240 (Spring 2014 ed.) p. 1117; cf. Use Note to California Jury Instructions--\nCriminal (CALJIC) No. 9.60 (Spring 2014 ed.) p. 976). That CALCRIM No. 1240, by\ndefault, omits the elements of \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeceit\u201d does not render the instruction\nerroneous. (Cf. People v. Fernandez (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 710, 716, fn.4 [approving\nsubstance of CALJIC No. 9.60 notwithstanding exclusion of \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeceit\u201d\nelements].) These disjunctive elements (see \u00a7 237; Haney, supra, at p. 313), which are\nrarely found in felony false imprisonment cases (see com. to CALCRIM No. 1240, supra,\n\n                                             9.\n\fp. 1117), were unnecessary in the instant case given that substantial evidence supported\ndefendant\u2019s convictions for felony false imprisonment by menace (ante, at pp. 5-8).8\nThus, we find the court properly instructed the jury on the elements of felony false\nimprisonment \u201c\u2018necessary for a proper determination.\u2019\u201d (Haney, supra, at p. 312.)\n       Defendant claims the court should have modified CALCRIM No. 1240, but does\nnot establish that he asked for such an instruction below. \u201cGenerally, a party may not\ncomplain on appeal that an instruction correct in law and responsive to the evidence was\ntoo general or incomplete unless the party has requested appropriate clarifying or\namplifying language.\u201d (People v. Andrews (1989) 49 Cal.3d 200, 218; see People v.\nLawrence (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 547, 553-554, fn. 11 [distinguishing between claim\nthat challenged instructions not \u201c\u2018correct in law\u2019\u201d and claim that such instructions were\n\u201cmerely incomplete\u201d].) Therefore, defendant forfeited the issue.\n\nIII.   The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed upper-term\n       sentences on counts 1 and 7.\n       a. Background\n       At the sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed the upper-term sentences on\ncount 1 for forcible sexual penetration and count 7 for assault with intent to commit\nforcible sexual penetration. (Ante, fn. 3.) The court cited the following circumstances in\naggravation:\n\n             \u201cThe circumstances in aggravation include that the victims were\n       vulnerable in that [defendant] lured them away from friends, took them to\n\n\n8      Furthermore, the record before us did not involve the type of conduct needed to\nsupport a charge of felony false imprisonment by fraud and/or deceit. (Cf. People v. Rios\n(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 445 [absent evidence of violence or menace, conviction for\nfelony false imprisonment upheld in consideration of evidence that the defendant picked\nup the victim from her home, told the victim\u2019s mother they would return the following\nday, brought the victim to Mexico, and lied to the victim\u2019s mother and authorities about\nthe victim\u2019s whereabouts for a four-year period].)\n\n\n\n                                            10.\n\f       portions of the river where they could not readily escape, and were\n       traveling on a jet ski where escape would cause injury. [\u00b6] \u2026 [\u00b6]\n\n              \u201cThe other circumstances in \u2026 aggravation [are] that the defendant\n       was convicted for other crimes for which consecutive sentences could be\n       imposed and for which concurrent sentences are being imposed; [and] the\n       defendant has engaged in violent conduct which indicates a serious danger\n       to society.\u201d\n       Defendant asserts the victims were not particularly vulnerable. He argues victim\nvulnerability \u201ctends to be found when the victim is younger or has a relationship with the\nperpetrator in which the perpetrator is dominant or has particular influence over the\nvictim.\u201d He also argues he was not, as the trial court stated, convicted of other crimes for\nwhich consecutive sentences could have been imposed but for which concurrent terms\nwere being imposed. Additionally, he asserts he was not \u201cengaged in violent conduct\nwhich indicates a serious danger to society.\u201d\n       b. Analysis\n       \u201cWhen a judgment of imprisonment is to be imposed and the statute specifies\nthree possible terms, the choice of the appropriate term shall rest within the sound\ndiscretion of the court.\u201d (\u00a7 1170, subd. (b); accord Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.433(c)(1).)\nThis choice is \u201csubject to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d (People v. Sandoval (2007) 41\nCal.4th 825, 847.) \u201cThe trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion must be exercised in a manner\nthat is not arbitrary and capricious, that is consistent with the letter and spirit of the law,\nand that is based upon an \u2018individualized consideration of the offense, the offender, and\nthe public interest.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Ibid.)\n       \u201c[A] trial court is free to base an upper term sentence upon any aggravating\ncircumstance that (1) the court deems significant and (2) is reasonably related to the\ndecision being made.\u201d (People v. Moberly (2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 1191, 1196; accord\nPeople v. Sandoval, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 848; see, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 4.421.) \u201cA single factor in aggravation is a sufficient basis for a sentencing choice.\u201d\n(People v. Castellano (1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 608, 615.)\n\n                                              11.\n\f       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed upper-\nterm sentences on counts 1 and 7, a decision largely based on the aggravating factor of\nthe victims being \u201cparticularly vulnerable.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.421(a)(3).)\nContrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, being \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d is not limited to victims\nwho are young or victims who have a preexisting subordinate relationship to the\nperpetrator. \u201c\u2018\u201c[P]articular vulnerability\u201d is determined in light of the \u201ctotal milieu in\nwhich the commission of the crime occurred \u2026.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (People v.\nWeaver (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1321.) A victim who is isolated and separated\nfrom others who could help is particularly vulnerable. (People v. Ramos (1980) 106\nCal.App.3d 591, 607 [victim alone in single room trailer particularly vulnerable due to\nisolation and not being \u201csubject to help from individuals who were passing by\u201d],\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 353, fn. 16, 356;\nPeople v. Burrell-Hart (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 593, 601 [rape victim particularly\nvulnerable where she is isolated inside the defendant\u2019s residence].)\n       Here, the record showed defendant took steps to separate Nicole and Carli from\ntheir respective groups and bring them to remote and isolated locations where he was able\nto commit the offenses without hindrance. We do not find the trial court acted in an\narbitrary or capricious manner when it found these facts to constitute a circumstance in\naggravation.9\n\nIV.    The trial court was required to stay execution of punishment on count 8\n       pursuant to section 654.\n       \u201cIn general, a person may be convicted of, although not punished for, more than\none crime arising out of the same act or course of conduct.\u201d (People v. Reed (2006) 38\nCal.4th 1224, 1226.) \u201cAn act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different\n\n9      Because this single aggravating factor constituted a sufficient basis for the trial\ncourt\u2019s sentencing choice (see People v. Castellano, supra, 140 Cal.App.3d at p. 615), we\nneed not discuss the other factors provided (ante, at p. 11).\n\n\n\n                                             12.\n\fprovisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest\npotential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished\nunder more than one provision. An acquittal or conviction and sentence under any one\nbars a prosecution for the same act or omission under any other.\u201d (\u00a7 654, subd. (a).)\n       We find, and the Attorney General agrees, the crimes of assault with intent to\ncommit forcible sexual penetration (count 7) and misdemeanor sexual battery (count 8)\narose out of the same act or course of conduct. For this reason, the 149-day jail sentence\non count 8 should have been and shall be stayed.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is modified to provide that the sentence on count 8 is stayed\npursuant to section 654. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is\ndirected to cause to be prepared an amended abstract of judgment reflecting said\nmodification and to transmit certified copies thereof to the appropriate authorities.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 _____________________\n                                                                            DETJEN, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\n GOMES, Acting P.J.\n\n\n _____________________\n KANE, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13.\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">Filed 8/26/14 P. v.

On December 12, 2012, the trial court sentenced defendant to 28 years in\nprison on counts 1 and 73 and 149 days in jail on counts 8 and 9.4 It stayed execution of\npunishment on counts 2 through 6.\n       On appeal, defendant contends: (1) the evidence did not support his convictions\non counts 2 and 6 for felony false imprisonment; (2) the trial court failed to modify\nJudicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instructions (CALCRIM) No. 1240 for\nfelony false imprisonment; (3) the court erroneously imposed upper-term sentences on\ncounts 1 and 7; and (4) the court failed to stay execution of punishment on count 8.5 We\nconclude: (1) substantial evidence supported defendant\u2019s convictions on counts 2 and 6;\n(2) the court properly instructed the jury on the elements of felony false imprisonment;\n(3) the court did not abuse its discretion when it imposed upper-term sentences on\ncounts 1 and 7; and (4) the court was required to stay execution of punishment on\ncount 8.

Prosecution case-in-chief.\n       a. Nicole S.6 (counts 1 through 4)\n       On June 19, 2012, Nicole and her friends were at a beach along Kings River in\nLaton, California. Defendant, who was driving a jet ski nearby, stopped, and asked,\n\u201c[w]ho wants a ride.\u201d One of Nicole\u2019s male companions asked for a ride. After they\nreturned, Nicole did not want to go for a ride, but \u201ceveryone [said] \u2026 go, go\u201d and\ndefendant said, \u201cyeah, come on,\u201d so Nicole got on the jet ski with defendant. Defendant\nhad Nicole ride in front of him. Defendant\u2019s hands were on the handlebars; the\nhandlebars included the throttle. The two headed down the river. When they reached a\nfork in the river, defendant tried to steer to the left, but Nicole took hold of the handlebars\nand steered to the right. By this time, she smelled alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath.\nDefendant pulled closer to Nicole, stated he was drunk, touched her waist, and asked,\n\u201cWhat are you going to do for me?\u201d She answered, \u201cWhat do you mean what am I going\nto do for you? You just gave him a ride, what did he do for you?\u201d Defendant replied,\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re a bitch, what are you going to do for me?\u201d\n       Defendant and Nicole came to a weir located approximately three miles away\nfrom the beach. Defendant turned off the jet ski and groped Nicole\u2019s breasts, midsection,\nand buttocks. Nicole asked him what he was doing, and told him to stop. Defendant\nbecame increasingly \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cscary\u201d and Nicole fought him. Nicole turned on\nthe jet ski and attempted to maneuver the vehicle to get back to her friends. While doing\nso, defendant kissed her neck, placed his right hand inside her bikini bottom, and inserted\na finger into her vagina. Nicole continued to resist defendant as she drove the jet ski back\n\n\n6      Certain persons are identified by an abbreviated name in accordance with our\nSupreme Court\u2019s policy regarding protective nondisclosure of identity. No disrespect is\nintended.\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fto the beach. When they arrived, she disembarked and cried. She threw dirt at defendant.\nWhen asked why, she said, \u201cbecause he[ was] dirt.\u201d When defendant was questioned by\nNicole\u2019s friends, he remarked, \u201cWasn\u2019t that why I gave her a ride?\u201d\n       b. Carli R. (counts 5 through 8)\n       In June 2012, Carli and her girlfriends were floating down Kings River when they\nsaw defendant driving his jet ski. She asked him for a ride because she \u201cthought it would\nbe fun.\u201d Defendant and Carli headed north at a rate of roughly 10 to 15 miles per hour\nand reached an isolated part of the river with which she was unfamiliar. She \u201cfelt\nuncomfortable\u201d because they \u201cwere gone for too long.\u201d Carli asked defendant to switch\npositions so that she could sit in front and be able to drive \u201cjust in case.\u201d After the two\ntraded seats, he placed his hands on her inner thighs. Carli told defendant to stop and\nremoved his hands. He again placed his hands on her inner thighs and then rubbed her\ncrotch on the outside of her bathing suit for \u201c[a] good amount of time\u201d and \u201c[l]ong\nenough for [her] to get scared.\u201d Carli eventually drove the jet ski back to her friends.\nMeanwhile, defendant instructed her to explain \u201c[they] were gone so long because [they]\nwent such a far distance.\u201d After they returned, Carli gestured to her friends not to ride\nwith him.\nII.    Defense case-in-chief.\n       Defendant testified. Regarding Nicole, he stated she, and one of her male friends\nasked him for a ride on his jet ski. He gave a ride to the friend first and then to Nicole.\nShe sat in front, turned on the jet ski, and drove. By this time, defendant had consumed\napproximately eight cans of beer. He fell asleep during the ride, but awakened due to\nlower back pain. Defendant contemplated \u201cwhat kind of girl\u201d Nicole was and placed his\nhand on her lap. She removed his hand and said, \u201cNo.\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cOh,\nwhat, I get nothing for the ride?\u201d Later, when he \u201cwas going to fall off\u201d the jet ski, he\nheld on to Nicole\u2019s midsection. Defendant only \u201cfelt the top of her waistband from her\n\n\n\n                                              4.\n\fbikini bottom.\u201d When the two returned to the beach, Nicole \u201cjumped off the jet ski and\nact[ed] like she was molested.\u201d\n       Regarding Carli, he stated she asked him for a ride on his jet ski because she was\ntired and he obliged. The pair headed upstream to see \u201cwhy the water [was] running so\nslow.\u201d At no point did Carli complain about the duration of this trip, which was\napproximately 20 minutes.

Viewed in\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, the record demonstrated that defendant controlled\nthe jet ski as he and Nicole traveled down Kings River for about three miles. Before they\nreached the weir, he drew closer to her, touched her, and insinuated that he expected her\nto engage in lascivious conduct in exchange for the ride. When Nicole objected,\ndefendant called her a \u201cbitch\u201d and again suggested that he was owed sexual gratification.\nThereafter, he brought her to the weir, turned off the jet ski, and sexually abused her.\nBased on the evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, that defendant intentionally restrained Nicole against her will by menace.\nAlthough Nicole voluntarily boarded the jet ski at the outset, she did not wish to remain\nafter defendant revealed his lewd intention. She could not, however, immediately\ndismount the moving vehicle without exposing herself to injury. Moreover, defendant\nonly stopped and turned off the jet ski once he and Nicole reached a secluded area of the\nriver where she was separated from her friends and his implicit threat\u2014he would not\nbring her back until he got what he wanted\u2014became more tangible.

The trial court properly instructed the jury on the elements of felony false\n       imprisonment.\n       a. Background\n       After close of evidence, the trial court read CALCRIM No. 1240 to the jury:\n\n              \u201cThe defendant is charged in Count 2 and 6 with false imprisonment\n       by violence or menace in violation of Penal Code Section 237(a)[.] [\u00b6] To\n       prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that:\n\n              \u201c1.

It is not necessary there be confinement\nin jail or prison. Any exercise of force or express or implied threat of force by which in\nfact the person is restrained from his liberty, compelled to remain where he does not wish\nto remain, or to go where he does not wish to go, is such imprisonment. The\nimprisonment may be committed by acts or words merely operating on the will of the\nindividual and/or personal violence. The acts must be done, the words must be said, with\nthe intent of causing the confinement. [Citations.]\u201d (Haney, supra, 75 Cal.App.3d at\np. 313.) \u201cIf the imprisonment is effected without the use of violence, menace, fraud or\ndeceit, it is a misdemeanor. The presence of one or more of these elements elevates the\nfalse imprisonment to a felony.\u201d (Ibid.)\n       Here, the trial court read CALCRIM No. 1240 verbatim. (See Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 2.1050(e) [use of Judicial Council jury instructions \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d and\n\u201crecommended\u201d].) This pattern instruction incorporates the \u201cprimary element of \u2026\nunlawful restraint of another\u2019s liberty\u201d (Haney, supra, 75 Cal.App.3d at p. 313) and\n\u201cfocuses on the use of violence or menace to restrain the victim\u201d (Com. to CALCRIM\nNo. 1240 (Spring 2014 ed.) p. 1117; cf.

That CALCRIM No. 1240, by\ndefault, omits the elements of \u201cfraud\u201d and \u201cdeceit\u201d does not render the instruction\nerroneous. (Cf. People v.

As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.
