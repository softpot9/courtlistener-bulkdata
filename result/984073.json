In the district\ncourt, Gordon sought a preliminary injunction against the\nenforcement of provisions of the Prevent All Cigarette\nTrafficking Act (PACT Act) that require him to pay state and\nlocal taxes and ban him from sending his products through the\nU.S. mail. Gordon argues that the tax provisions violate the\nDue Process Clause and the Tenth Amendment and that the\n\f                                 5\n\nmail ban runs afoul of the Due Process and Equal Protection\nClauses.\n\n    The district court enjoined the enforcement of the tax\nprovisions on due process grounds, but otherwise dismissed\nGordon\u2019s claims. The government appeals the preliminary\ninjunction, and Gordon cross-appeals the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of, and refusal to grant a preliminary injunction for,\nhis remaining claims. For the reasons set forth below, we\naffirm the district court\u2019s decision in its entirety.\n\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n     In most states, the liability for sales and use taxes falls\nprimarily on the buyer. U.S. Government Accountability\nOffice, GAO-03-714T, Internet Cigarette Sales: Limited\nCompliance and Enforcement of the Jenkins Act Result in Loss\nof State Tax Revenue 3 (2003) (hereinafter GAO Report);\nWALTER HELLERSTEIN, STATE TAXATION \u00b6 12.01 (3d ed.\n2012). States require retailers to collect applicable taxes from\nresident buyers and remit the receipts to the state. STEVEN\nMAGUIRE, CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERV., STATE\nTAXATION OF INTERNET TRANSACTIONS 1 (2013). A state may\nnot, however, impose such an obligation on a retailer with\nwhom the state lacks minimum contacts. See Quill Corp. v.\nNorth Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992). 1 This means that most\n\n    1\n       The minimum contacts requirement derives from the Due\nProcess Clause. The Due Process Clause is not the only provision of\nthe Constitution that limits states\u2019 authority to tax: the so-called\nDormant Commerce Clause prohibits states from requiring retailers\nwith whom the state lacks a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d to collect taxes,\nabsent congressional authorization. Quill, 504 U.S. at 311. The\n\f                                  6\n\nout-of-state retailers operate beyond the state\u2019s regulatory\nreach. When they cannot rely on retailers to collect taxes, states\nfind it both expensive and difficult to track the smaller\nout-of-state purchases of their residents and to collect the\napplicable taxes directly from them. This creates an\nopportunity for tax evasion that is especially costly when it\ncomes to goods like tobacco products that are taxed at high\nrates. GAO Report, supra, at 7. In an effort to eliminate this\nopportunity for tobacco buyers, Congress passed the Jenkins\nAct, which obligates retailers to report each interstate sale of\ntobacco products to the tax authority of the consumer\u2019s state.\nPub. L. No. 81-363, 63 Stat. 884 (1949).\n\n     More than a half century has elapsed since the passage of\nthe Jenkins Act, and as the Internet has made it easier for\nconsumers to order tobacco products from out-of-state sellers,\nit has become more difficult for states and localities to collect\ntaxes on these transactions. H.R. Rep. No. 111-117, at 18-19\n(2009); see also GAO Report, supra, at 8, 12-13. Remote\npurchasing also makes it easier for parties to evade age\nrestrictions and otherwise traffic in cigarettes illegally. 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7 375 note; see also H.R. Rep. No. 111-117, at 18.\n\nDormant Commerce Clause \u201cnexus\u201d test may be more demanding\nthan the Due Process Clause \u201cminimum contacts\u201d test, see id. at 313,\n317-18, but it is not at issue in this case because Gordon challenges a\nfederal statute.\n     My concurring colleague criticizes this footnote as\n\u201cgratuitous.\u201d Post, at 1 (Sentelle, J., concurring). I disclaim any\nattempt to opine on the effect of the Dormant Commerce Clause,\nwhich, as my colleague correctly points out, is not at issue in this\ncase. I include this incontrovertible description of the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine only to clarify that the\nDue Process Clause is not the only provision that restricts a state\u2019s\npower to tax out-of-state retailers.\n\f                                 7\n\nFinding the Jenkins Act inadequate, H.R. Rep. No. 111-117, at\n18, Congress has sent the PACT Act into the breach.\n\n     The PACT Act is \u201caimed primarily at combating three\nevils: tobacco sales to minors, [illicit] cigarette trafficking, and\ncircumvention of state taxation requirements.\u201d Gordon v.\nHolder (Gordon I), 632 F.3d 722, 723 (D.C. Cir. 2011). It does\nso by restricting \u201cdelivery sales\u201d of cigarettes and smokeless\ntobacco products. A delivery sale is any sale in which either the\npurchase or the delivery does not occur face-to-face. 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 375(5). Two sections of the Act are at issue here. Section 2a\nprohibits delivery sales unless all applicable state and local\ntaxes are paid \u201cin advance of the sale, delivery, or tender.\u201d 15\nU.S.C. \u00a7 376a(a)(3)-(4), (d).

Section 3 prohibits\nsending tobacco products in the U.S. mail. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1716E.\nAs a result, tobacco delivery sellers must resort to private\ncarriers.\n\n                                 B\n\n     According to his complaint, Robert Gordon ran a business\nselling tobacco products in the Alleghany Territory of the\nSeneca Nation of Indians, located in western New York. After\nstarting his business in 2002, Gordon accepted orders in\nperson, over the phone, and occasionally online. At the height\nof his business, Gordon took in two million dollars in revenue\nevery month. Ninety-five percent of that revenue came from\n\f                                 8\n\nsales to customers outside of New York. Gordon claims,\nhowever, that he has never made a sale into some state and\nlocal taxing jurisdictions within the United States. See Marcia\nGordon Second Decl. \u00b6 13.\n\n     Gordon asserts that his business has suffered under the\nPACT Act. Until recently, Gordon has enjoyed the protection\nof a Western District of New York preliminary injunction\nagainst the enforcement of the tax provisions, 2 but the mail\nban has taken its toll. The major private carriers \u2013 Federal\nExpress, United Parcel Service, and DHL \u2013 also refuse to\ndeliver tobacco products, leaving Gordon with only more\nexpensive couriers. On May 30, 2013, while this appeal was\npending, Gordon notified the court that he has found it\nnecessary to close his business.\n\n                                 C\n\n    Gordon\u2019s case has been before us already. Gordon v.\nHolder (Gordon I), 632 F.3d 722 (D.C. Cir. 2011). On June 28,\n2010, the day before the PACT Act took effect, Gordon filed a\ncomplaint alleging that the tax provisions and the mail ban are\nunconstitutional and sought a preliminary injunction against\n\n    2\n       A group of plaintiffs brought a similar challenge to the PACT\nAct in the Western District of New York, and that district court\ngranted a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the tax\nprovisions on due process grounds. See Red Earth LLC v. United\nStates, 728 F. Supp. 2d 238 (W.D.N.Y. 2010). The Second Circuit\nupheld the preliminary injunction. Red Earth LLC v. United States,\n657 F.3d 138 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam). On June 7, 2013, the\nparties voluntarily stipulated to dismissal with prejudice, and the\ncourt vacated the injunction. See Stipulation and Order of Dismissal,\nRed Earth LLC v. United States, No. 10-CV-530 (W.D.N.Y. June 7,\n2013).\n\f                                   9\n\ntheir enforcement. Id. at 723. The district court denied\nGordon\u2019s motion the next day on the sole ground that it was too\nlate to stop the Act from taking effect. Id. at 724. Gordon\nappealed.\n\n     We remanded Gordon\u2019s motion to the district court to\nconsider the factors a plaintiff must demonstrate to obtain a\npreliminary injunction. Gordon I, 632 F.3d at 726. On remand,\nthe district court enjoined the tax provisions on due process\ngrounds, but dismissed for failure to state a claim Gordon\u2019s\nTenth Amendment challenge to the tax provisions and his due\nprocess and equal protection challenge to the mail ban. See\nGordon v. Holder, 826 F. Supp. 2d 279 (D.D.C. 2011). Both\nparties appealed.\n\n     We have jurisdiction to review the resolution of Gordon\u2019s\nmotion for a preliminary injunction under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1292(a)(1), and the dismissal of his claims under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1291. The closure of Gordon\u2019s business has not mooted his\nappeal. His wife submitted a sworn declaration that she and\nGordon intend to reopen their business if they prevail, and that\nthey remain capable of doing so. Marcia Gordon Third Decl.\n\u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Gordon\u2019s \u201cuncontroverted intention to operate in the\nfuture in ways that would violate\u201d the PACT Act \u201ckeeps the\ncontroversy alive.\u201d See Unity08 v. FEC, 596 F.3d 861, 864\n(D.C. Cir. 2010). 3\n\n\n     3\n        Because we are required to ascertain our jurisdiction before\nproceeding to the merits of an appeal, see Steel Co. v. Citizens for a\nBetter Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83 (1998), our conclusion that the closure of\nGordon\u2019s business does not moot this case is final. Naturally, facts\nmay develop that moot the case in the future, at which point the\ndistrict court would be required to dismiss Gordon\u2019s complaint. But\nthe district court is not, as our concurring colleague seems to suggest,\n\f                                   10\n\n\n                                    II\n\n     As we explained in Gordon I, \u201c\u2018[a] plaintiff seeking a\npreliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to\nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable\nharm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of\nthe equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the\npublic interest.\u2019\u201d 632 F.3d at 724 (quoting Winter v. Natural\nRes. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). We review the\n\u201cdistrict court\u2019s weighing of the four preliminary injunction\nfactors and its ultimate decision to issue or deny such relief for\nabuse of discretion.\u201d Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.,\n571 F.3d 1288, 1291 (D.C. Cir. 2009). We review the district\ncourt\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for\nclear error. In re Navy Chaplaincy, 697 F.3d 1171, 1178 (D.C.\nCir. 2012). But, as the Supreme Court admonished in Ashcroft\nv. ACLU, where \u201cthe underlying constitutional question is\nclose\u201d we must \u201cuphold the injunction and remand for trial on\nthe merits.\u201d 542 U.S. 656, 664-65 (2004); see also Red Earth\nLLC v. United States, 657 F.3d 138, 145 (2d Cir. 2011) (per\ncuriam) (\u201cBecause the district court reached a reasonable\nconclusion on a close question of law, there is no need for us to\ndecide the merits at this preliminary stage.\u201d). Under Ashcroft,\nif the district court\u2019s analysis of the preliminary injunction\nfactors reflects a reasonable conclusion about a close question\nof constitutional law, and contains no other legal error, then we\nmust send the case back to the district court with the\npreliminary injunction intact. We must refrain from resolving\nnovel and difficult constitutional questions, leaving them to be\n\n\n\npost, at 1 (Sentelle, J., concurring), free to revisit our holding that the\ncase is currently an Article III case or controversy.\n\f                               11\n\nsettled at a later stage, with the benefit of further factual and\nlegal development.\n\n     The government and dissent argue that Ashcroft\u2019s gloss on\nthe standard of review applies only to preliminary injunctions\nbased on the First Amendment, when the government bears a\nspecial burden to justify the challenged law with a compelling\ngovernmental interest. Appellants\u2019 Reply Br. 16 n.9 (citing\nGonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal,\n546 U.S. 418, 429-30 (2006)). We disagree. The Ashcroft\nCourt expressly derived its deferential approach \u201cfrom\nestablished standards of appellate review\u201d set out in Walters v.\nNational Association of Radiation Survivors \u2013 a case involving\na preliminary injunction based, like the one here, on the Due\nProcess Clause. Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 664 (quoting Walters,\n473 U.S. 305, 336 (1985) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring)). Our\nsister circuits have also applied Ashcroft\u2019s standard of review\nto preliminary injunctions based on due process challenges.\nSee Red Earth, 657 F.3d at 145 (applying Ashcroft to an\nidentical due process challenge to the PACT Act);\nReproductive Health Serv. of Planned Parenthood of St. Louis\nRegion v. Nixon, 428 F.3d 1139, 1145 (8th Cir. 2005)\n(applying Ashcroft to a constitutional challenge to an abortion\nregulation). In fact, we find no case expressly limiting\nAshcroft\u2019s command to First Amendment challenges. To be\nsure, Ashcroft was a First Amendment case, and certain\nfeatures of the Court\u2019s analysis naturally have no bearing\noutside the First Amendment context. For example, the Court\naffirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was\nlikely to succeed on the merits because the government had not\nmet its special First Amendment burden to justify the\nchallenged restrictions on speech with a compelling\ngovernmental interest. See Gonzales, 546 U.S. at 429\n(describing Ashcroft). But the Ashcroft Court\u2019s description of\nour standard of review is not so restricted. It reflects the\n\f                                 12\n\ngeneral principle that, even though Congress has provided for\ninterlocutory review of preliminary injunctions, premature\nresolution of difficult constitutional questions is undesirable.\nCf. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 239 (2009) (describing\nthe dangers of premature resolution of constitutional\nquestions); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 549-50 (1985)\n(Brennan, J., dissenting) (\u201c[R]esolution of even the most\nabstract legal disputes is advanced by the presence of a\nconcrete set of facts.\u201d). Thus, the Court\u2019s command to uphold\nthe injunction when \u201cthe underlying constitutional question is\nclose\u201d binds us today.\n\n     We conclude that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by entering a preliminary injunction.\n\n                                 A\n\n     We begin with the district court\u2019s assessment of Gordon\u2019s\nlikelihood of success on the merits, which is left untouched by\nthe closure of Gordon\u2019s business. The district court held that\nGordon is likely to succeed on the merits of his due process\nchallenge. Gordon, 826 F. Supp. 2d at 293. Because we find\nthe underlying constitutional questions to be close, we affirm\nthe district court\u2019s conclusion. See Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at\n664-65. 4\n     4\n       For this reason, contrary to my concurring colleague\u2019s\nstatement, Part II.A \u201celevat[es]\u201d nothing \u201cto circuit law.\u201d Post, at 1\n(Sentelle, J., concurring). The legal premises of Gordon\u2019s due\nprocess challenge remain fair game on remand; we merely conclude\nthat the questions they raise are too close to call at this stage. See\nSherley v. Sebelius, 689 F.3d 776, 781 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (\u201c[T]he\ndecision of a trial or appellate court whether to grant or deny a\npreliminary injunction does not constitute law of the case for the\npurpose of further proceedings and does not limit or preclude the\nparties from litigating the merits.\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\f                                 13\n\n\n     Gordon argues that the PACT Act \u201cviolates nonresident\ntobacco retailers\u2019 due process rights . . . by subjecting them to\ntaxes in state and local forums without regard to whether they\nhave minimum contacts with the taxing jurisdiction.\u201d 5\nAppellee\u2019s Br. 21. This argument presents two substantial and\nnovel constitutional questions. First, does the Due Process\nClause require minimum contacts between the state or local\ntaxing authority and the nonresident seller even when the\nfederal government is the source of the seller\u2019s duty to collect\ntaxes? And second, if due process requires minimum contacts\nwith the state or local taxing jurisdiction, does a single delivery\nsale to a buyer in that jurisdiction create minimum contacts?\nBoth are questions of law, but they are matters of first\nimpression, and their resolution would benefit from fuller\nfactual development below. See Pearson, 555 U.S. at 239. We\ndo not settle them here because we need not do so to affirm the\npreliminary injunction.\n\n                                 1\n\n     Although it is well-settled that the Due Process Clause\nrequires minimum contacts between the taxing sovereign and\nthe taxed entity, see Miller Bros. Co. v. Maryland, 347 U.S.\n340, 342, 344-45 (1954), this appeal presents a unique twist on\nthat principle: with which sovereign must the taxed entity\npossess minimum contacts when there is one sovereign that\ndefines and benefits from the tax obligation (in this case, the\nstate or local government), and another that imposes and\n    5\n       As discussed above, Gordon is formally \u201ccollecting\u201d taxes\nowed by the buyer and remitting them to the state, rather than paying\nthem. Under the Due Process Clause, we treat an obligation to collect\ntaxes the same as an obligation to pay taxes. See Quill, 504 U.S. at\n319 (Scalia, J., concurring) (collecting cases).\n\f                                14\n\nenforces the obligation (in this case, the federal government)?\nGordon and the government think that the question can be\nresolved by reference to precedent. We do not. This question is\nnovel and close, and we cannot say that the district court\u2019s\nconclusion that Gordon is likely to succeed on the merits is an\nabuse of discretion. We are therefore bound to affirm its\ndetermination. See Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 664-65.\n\n     For its part, the government argues that the Act is\nconstitutional because Gordon has minimum contacts with the\nfederal government, the sovereign that imposed and will\nenforce his tax obligations. The government correctly points\nout that this is not the first time a seller has challenged\nCongress\u2019s power to oblige participants in interstate commerce\nto comply with state-defined duties. The Supreme Court has\ntwice upheld federal laws against similar challenges \u2013 one to\nthe Ashurst-Sumners Act and one to the Webb-Kenyon Act.\nSee Ky. Whip & Collar Co. v. Ill. Cent. Ry. Co., 299 U.S. 334\n(1937); James Clark Distilling Co. v. W. Maryland Ry. Co.,\n242 U.S. 311 (1917). The Ashurst-Sumners Act made \u201cit\nunlawful knowingly to transport in interstate or foreign\ncommerce goods made by convict labor into any State where\nthe goods are intended to be received, possessed, sold, or used\nin violation of its laws.\u201d Kentucky Whip & Collar Co., 299\nU.S. at 343. The Webb-Kenyon Act prohibited \u201cthe\ntransportation in interstate commerce of all liquor\n\u2018intended . . . to be received, possessed, sold, or in any manner\nused . . . in violation of any law of\u201d the destination state. James\nClark Distilling Co., 242 U.S. at 321. In both cases, the\nSupreme Court deemed it irrelevant that the states defined the\ncompanies\u2019 legal duties because the \u201cwill\u201d behind the two laws\nwas Congress\u2019s, not the states\u2019. Ky. Whip & Collar Co., 299\nU.S. at 347-52; James Clark Distilling Co., 242 U.S. at 326.\nThe \u201cwill\u201d behind the PACT Act is also Congress\u2019s, so the\ngovernment argues that these precedents require us to\n\f                                 15\n\ndisregard the role the states play in defining Gordon\u2019s legal\nduties. Appellants\u2019 Br. 25, 27; see also Musser\u2019s Inc. v. United\nStates, No. 10-4355, 2011 WL 4467784, *5 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 26,\n2011) (\u201c[T]he Act\u2019s tax-payment requirement is not being\nimposed by a state, acting unilaterally, but by Congress, and\nthe legislative due process analysis must reflect the federal\ncharacter of the legislation.\u201d). Because Congress\u2019s \u201cwill\u201d\nconverts the state taxes into federal duties, the argument goes,\nthe Due Process Clause demands minimum contacts only\nbetween Gordon and the federal government.\n\n     The government\u2019s argument overlooks an important\ndistinction: The challenges to the federal statutes at issue in\nJames Clark Distilling Company and Kentucky Whip & Collar\nCompany were brought under the Commerce Clause; unlike\nGordon\u2019s challenge, they raised no issue of minimum contacts\nunder the Due Process Clause. 6 See James Clark Distilling\n\n     6\n        The parties in those cases raised due process challenges, but\nnot of the sort we consider here. See James Clark Distilling Co., 242\nU.S. at 320 (\u201cThat government can, consistently with the due process\nclause, forbid the manufacture and sale of liquor and regulate its\ntraffic, is not open to controversy . . . .\u201d); id. at 332 (\u201cIt is only\nnecessary to point out that the considerations which we have stated\ndispose of all contentions that the Webb-Kenyon Act is repugnant to\nthe due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, since what we have\nsaid concerning that clause in the Fourteenth Amendment as applied\nto state power is decisive.\u201d); Ky. Whip & Collar Co., 299 U.S. at 352\n(\u201cIn the congressional action there is nothing arbitrary or capricious\nbringing the statute into collision with the requirements of due\nprocess of law.\u201d).\n\n     The government and the dissent, post, at 2-3 (Kavanaugh, J.,\ndissenting), identify several other federal statutes that subject\nout-of-state sellers to state regulation. These statutes likewise have\nnever been scrutinized under the Due Process Clause. The one\n\f                                 16\n\nCo., 242 U.S. at 326; Ky.

Id. But a medicine that cures one ailment may be\nfeckless against the next. No doctor would prescribe penicillin\nfor a broken arm; nor will we uncritically hand out the\nSupreme Court\u2019s Commerce Clause prescription when a\nlitigant comes to us complaining of a due process injury.\nCongress\u2019s \u201cwill\u201d might cure the due process injury that would\notherwise arise if the states tried unilaterally to impose taxes on\nGordon. But to reach that conclusion, we must conduct a closer\n\n\n\nexception is the Jenkins Act, which a three judge district court once\nupheld against a due process challenge. See Consumer Mail Order\nAss\u2019n of Am. v. McGrath, 94 F. Supp. 705 (D.D.C. 1950). But that\nAct is distinguishable because the federal government imposed,\ndefined, and enforced the duty, rather than incorporating a duty\ncreated by state law. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 376 (setting out detailed\nrequirements for the report the seller must submit to the state).\n\n     All of these federal laws are distinguishable from the PACT Act\nfor an additional reason: the state laws they incorporate do not\nimpose a duty to collect taxes; they regulate commercial activity\ninstead. The Court has long held that mere contact through the U.S.\nmail provides the \u201cminimum contact\u201d required for a state to assert\nregulatory, as distinguished from taxation, jurisdiction. See\nTravelers Health Ass\u2019n v. Virginia ex rel. State Corp. Comm\u2019n, 339\nU.S. 643, 646-50 (1950). For that reason, the laws cited by the\ngovernment and the dissent arguably satisfy the Due Process Clause\neven if Gordon is correct that the Clause requires minimum contacts\nbetween the seller and the state or locality.\n\f                                17\n\nexamination of \u201cthe Due Process principles of fair play and\nsubstantial justice.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Sensitive to the distinctions between the Due Process and\nCommerce Clauses, Gordon argues that the answer to this\nquestion is found in the principles set out in Quill Corp. v.\nNorth Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992). In Quill, an out-of-state\nmail-order catalogue business challenged a state law that\ncompelled \u201cevery person who engages in regular or systematic\nsolicitation of a consumer market in\u201d North Dakota to collect\nuse taxes from its customers and remit them to the state. Id. at\n302-03 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even though Quill\nwas a Delaware corporation with no physical presence in North\nDakota, the state statute required the company to collect North\nDakota use taxes because it engaged in \u201cregular or systematic\nsolicitation\u201d in the state, as defined by the statute. Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Quill challenged the law under the\nDue Process and Commerce Clauses. Id. at 303-04. Before\naddressing these separate challenges, the Court discussed the\ndifferences between the clauses as they relate to the state\u2019s\npower to regulate an entity located in another state. Id. at\n305-06. In dicta, the Court explained: \u201cWhile Congress . . .\nmay authorize state actions that burden interstate commerce, it\ndoes not similarly have the power to authorize violations of the\nDue Process Clause.\u201d Id. at 305 (internal citations omitted).\nThen, the Court set out the fundamental rule that the Due\nProcess Clause requires minimum contacts between the taxing\nsovereign and the taxed entity. Id. at 306. Taken together,\nGordon argues, the legal principles set forth in Quill prohibit\nCongress from imposing state or local taxes on out-of-state\nsellers who lack minimum contacts with the state or locality.\n\n    Even the government concedes that, after Quill, Congress\nmay not authorize a state to impose the duty to collect state use\ntaxes on delivery sellers lacking minimum contacts with the\n\f                                 18\n\nstate. But that is not what the PACT Act does. Section 2a does\nnot address itself to states at all. Rather than authorizing the\nstates to impose on Gordon a state duty to collect state taxes,\nthe PACT Act imposes on Gordon a federal duty to collect\nstate taxes. States would enforce their own taxes if Congress\nmerely authorized them to tax, whereas they must rely on the\nfederal government to do so under the PACT Act. Because this\ndistinction may make all the difference under the Due Process\nClause, the precedent on which Gordon relies does not resolve\nour constitutional question.\n\n    Finding no conclusive precedent, we turn to first\nprinciples and there find support for Gordon\u2019s argument that\ndue process requires minimum contacts with the state or local\ngovernment that defines the tax. 7 At its most basic level, \u201c[t]he\n\n     7\n       My concurring colleague asserts that no court has \u201cundertaken\nth[is] search before affirming the legitimacy of a tax.\u201d Post, at 1\n(Sentelle, J., concurring). We need look no further than Quill to find\nan example of the Supreme Court returning to first principles to\nunderstand what type of \u201cminimum contacts\u201d serve to legitimate a\nstate tax. See, e.g., Quill, 504 U.S. at 312 (comparing the principles\nthat animate the Due Process Clause with those that animate the\nDormant Commerce Clause); see also New York ex rel. Cohn v.\nGraves, 300 U.S. 308, 312-13 (1937); Pollock v. Farmers\u2019 Loan &\nTrust Co., 157 U.S. 429, 555-57 (1895), overruled by U.S. CONST.\namend. XVI. It seems to me that this approach is to be encouraged\nwhen we are asked to apply existing law to novel cases. See, e.g.,\nFCC v. Fox TV Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 531-32 (2009) (Thomas,\nJ., concurring) (criticizing the Court for not \u201clooking to first\nprinciples to evaluate the constitutional question\u201d when faced with\nnovel fact patterns); Morse v.

In order to protect this principle of just\nexchange, we uphold \u201cthe power of a state to impose liability\non an out-of-state seller to collect a local use tax [when] the\nout-of-state seller was plainly accorded the protections and\nservices of the taxing state.\u201d Nat\u2019l Bellas Hess, 386 U.S. at\n757.

But when\nminimum contacts with that state or locality are lacking, the\nstate or locality offers no services or protections to justify the\ntax it receives.

In so holding, we caution\nthat we are not deciding as a matter of law which sovereign a\ncourt must look to in completing its minimum contacts\nanalysis. That question is one of significant moment, touching\ncore federalism concerns. J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd., 131 S. Ct. at\n2789. And as this discussion reveals, the PACT Act has been\ncast in a mold that has never been constitutionally tested. We\nare unwilling to resolve such an important and novel\nconstitutional question without the benefit of further factual\ndevelopment.\n\n     Before we may affirm the preliminary injunction,\nhowever, we must address the second constitutional question\nthat informed the district court\u2019s conclusion that Gordon is\nlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim.\n\n                                2\n\n     Under Section 2a of the PACT Act, Gordon\u2019s obligation to\ncollect a given state or local tax attaches when he initiates a\ntransaction within that jurisdiction. Gordon\u2019s due process\nchallenge presents the question whether a single sale is enough\nto establish minimum contacts with that jurisdiction. The\ngovernment asserts it is, providing a constitutional basis for the\nAct even if Gordon is correct that the Due Process Clause\ndemands minimum contacts with the state or local taxing\nauthority. Appellants\u2019 Br. 30-33. Once again, the question is a\nclose one, deserving of further development at a trial on the\nmerits, so we affirm and remand. See Red Earth, 657 F.3d at\n145 (affirming a preliminary injunction against Section 2a of\n\f                                25\n\nthe PACT Act on this ground and remanding for a trial on the\nmerits).\n\n     Due process jurisprudence on \u201cminimum contacts\u201d has\nevolved significantly over the past half-century. In National\nBellas Hess v. Department of Revenue, the Supreme Court held\nthat minimum contacts do not exist between a state and a seller\n\u201cwhose only connection with customers in the State is by\ncommon carrier or the United States mail.\u201d 386 U.S. at 758;\nsee also Miller Bros. Co., 347 U.S. at 344-45. National Bellas\nHess was commonly understood to require that the seller have\nsome \u201cphysical presence\u201d in the taxing state. Quill, 504 U.S. at\n306-07. Thirty years later, in Quill, the Supreme Court\noverruled that holding. Id. at 308. Relying on \u201ccomparable\u201d\nreasoning in cases concerning the personal jurisdiction of\ncourts, the Court concluded that North Dakota\u2019s imposition of\na duty to collect a use tax on Quill did not violate the Due\nProcess Clause, even though Quill\u2019s only contacts with citizens\nof North Dakota occurred by means of mail or common carrier.\nId. The court relied on the fact that Quill purposefully directed\nits activities at residents of North Dakota, that it had conducted\na high volume of business with customers in that state, and that\nthe use tax was \u201crelated to the benefits Quill receives from\naccess to the state.\u201d Id.\n\n     But \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has never found \u2018that a single\nisolated sale . . . is sufficient\u2019\u201d to establish minimum contacts.\nRed Earth, 657 F.3d at 145 (quoting J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd.,\n131 S. Ct. at 2792 (Breyer, J., concurring)). While it may prove\nto be the case that, in the Internet age, a single sale establishes\n\u201cminimum contacts\u201d as a matter of law, this seems like\nprecisely the sort of difficult constitutional question on which\nour analysis would benefit from factual development. For\nexample, how difficult is it for a delivery seller to identify and\ncalculate applicable taxes at the point of sale? What sorts of\n\f                                  26\n\nservices do states provide to delivery sellers (e.g., a forum for\ncollecting debts from buyers, trash disposal for shipping\ncartons)? Without this knowledge, we find no reason to upset\nthe district court\u2019s reasonable conclusion that Gordon has\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his due\nprocess challenge to the tax provisions of the PACT Act. We\nunderscore that our analysis is preliminary; we make no final\ndetermination on the merits of Gordon\u2019s due process\nchallenge.\n\n                                  B\n\n     We likewise hold that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in determining where the public interest lies when it\nconcluded that \u201cenforcement of a potentially unconstitutional\nlaw that would also have severe economic effects is not in the\npublic interest.\u201d Gordon, 826 F. Supp. 2d at 297.\n\n     Relying upon United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyer\u2019s\nCoop., 532 U.S. 483, 497 (2001), the government argues that\nthe court erred as a matter of law \u201cby failing to give any\ndeference to Congress\u2019s assessment of where the public\ninterest lies.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 39. 10 In Oakland, the\ngovernment invoked the Controlled Substances Act to enjoin\nthe cooperative from distributing marijuana. Citing the \u201cpublic\ninterest,\u201d the district court modified the injunction to permit\ndistribution in cases of medical necessity. 532 U.S. at 495. The\nSupreme Court overturned the court of appeals decision\naffirming the modified injunction, holding that the district\n\n     10\n        The government also seeks support for this argument in Able\nv. United States, 44 F.3d 128, 131-32 (2d Cir. 1995). The\ngovernment\u2019s reliance on Able is misplaced. The cited holding\nrelates not to the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d but to the \u201clikelihood of success\non the merits.\u201d Id. at 130-31.\n\f                               27\n\ncourt\u2019s considerable discretion to fashion equitable relief is\nbounded when it comes to deciding whether the \u201cpublic\ninterest\u201d favors an injunction. Id. at 497. The district court\ncould not \u201c\u2018ignore the judgment of Congress, deliberately\nexpressed in legislation\u2019\u201d by considering \u201cany and all factors\nthat might relate to the public interest.\u201d Id. (quoting Virginian\nRy. Co. v. Ry. Sys. Fed\u2019n No. 40, Emps. Dep\u2019t of the Am. Fed\u2019n\nof Labor, 300 U.S. 515 (1937)).\n\n     The district court did not transgress the limits on its\ndiscretion here. Oakland prohibits a district court from\nsecond-guessing Congress\u2019s lawful prioritization of its policy\ngoals. Id. For example, under the rationale of Oakland, it\nwould have been wrong for the district court to hold that the\npublic interest in preserving tobacco industry jobs outweighs\nthe public health harms attributable to underage smoking. Such\na holding would interfere with Congress\u2019s \u201cdelegated powers\u201d\nto \u201cdecide[] the order of priorities.\u201d Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). But the district court here did not second-guess\nCongress\u2019s policy priorities \u2013 only the lawfulness of\nCongress\u2019s means of achieving those priorities. In doing so, the\ncourt acknowledged the obvious: enforcement of an\nunconstitutional law is always contrary to the public interest.\nSee, e.g., Lamprecht v. FCC, 958 F.2d 382, 390 (D.C. Cir.\n1992); G & V Lounge v. Michigan Liquor Control Comm\u2019n, 23\nF.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994); Llewlyn v. Oakland Cnty.\nProsecutor\u2019s Office, 402 F. Supp. 1379, 1393 (E.D. Mich.\n1975) (\u201c[I]t may be assumed that the Constitution is the\nultimate expression of the public interest.\u201d). The Constitution\ndoes not permit Congress to prioritize any policy goal over the\nDue Process Clause.\n\f                               28\n\n                                C\n\n     Finally, we hold that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion when it concluded that Gordon was likely to suffer\nirreparable harm and that the balance of the equities tips in his\nfavor.\n\n     Gordon argued that the PACT Act would cause him\nirreparable harm because it threatened the existence of his\nbusiness and violated his constitutional rights. \u201c[S]uits for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against the threatened\ninvasion of a constitutional right do not ordinarily require\nproof of any injury other than the threatened constitutional\ndeprivation itself.\u201d Davis v. District of Columbia, 158 F.3d\n1342, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Thus, \u201c[a]lthough a plaintiff\nseeking equitable relief must show a threat of substantial and\nimmediate irreparable injury, a prospective violation of a\nconstitutional right constitutes irreparable injury for these\npurposes.\u201d Id. (internal citation omitted). The district court did\nnot abuse its discretion by concluding that Gordon had\ndemonstrated such a threat: when he was in business, the Act\nrequired Gordon to pay what he alleges are unconstitutional\ntaxes or else risk criminal and civil penalties.\n\n     Similarly, the district court concluded that \u201ca potential\ndeprivation of [Gordon\u2019s] constitutional right to due\nprocess . . . outweighs the possible injury to defendants from\nenjoining enforcement until the merits of Gordon\u2019s claim can\nbe determined.\u201d Gordon, 826 F. Supp. 2d at 297. Although the\npreliminary injunction might temporarily frustrate the federal\ngovernment\u2019s interest in enforcing state and local tax laws, the\ndistrict court permissibly gave greater weight to the possibility\nthat Gordon could suffer an ongoing constitutional violation\nwhile this litigation proceeds.\n\f                               29\n\n     Now that Gordon\u2019s business has ceased operations, he\narguably no longer faces the dilemma on which the district\ncourt based its finding of irreparable injury. Neither does the\ngovernment face the prospect of watching Gordon\u2019s cigarette\nsales go untaxed. As the administrator of the injunction, the\ndistrict court is better placed than we are to judge its ongoing\nnecessity. Our charge in a \u00a7 1292(a)(1) appeal is limited to\ndetermining whether the district court acted within its\ndiscretion by issuing the preliminary injunction in the first\ninstance. Finding no abuse of discretion, we decline the\ngovernment\u2019s invitation to vacate the injunction. In reaching\nthat decision, we are sensitive to the gravity of enjoining an act\nof Congress, even temporarily. The government remains free\nto petition the district court for relief from the preliminary\ninjunction in light of the changed circumstances. See FED. R.\nCIV. P. 60(b) (empowering the district court to \u201crelieve a party\u201d\nfrom an order).\n\n                               III\n\n     Before we turn to the claims the district court dismissed,\nwe must consider the government\u2019s argument that the\npreliminary injunction is overbroad. The government argues\nthat the injunction, which bars it from enforcing the tax\nprovisions against Gordon at all, should have prohibited it only\nfrom enforcing the provisions against Gordon\u2019s sales into\njurisdictions with which he lacks minimum contacts. We hold\nthat the district court adequately fulfilled its duty to \u201cmaintain\nthe act in so far as it is valid.\u201d Red Earth, 657 F.3d at 145\n(quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 684\n(1987)). By demanding that the injunction be narrower, the\ngovernment asks the district court to put the cart before the\nhorse. To accede to the government\u2019s argument, the district\ncourt would not only have to define the much-disputed concept\nof \u201cminimum contacts,\u201d but would also have to engage in\n\f                                30\n\nsignificant fact-finding to determine where around the country\nGordon has established minimum contacts. See Marcia Gordon\nSecond Decl. \u00b6 13 (\u201cThere are several states in which we have\nmade zero or very few sales. In addition, there are many local\njurisdictions in which we have never made a sale.\u201d).\nPreliminary injunction hearings are ill-suited for such fine\ntailoring.\n\n     More fundamentally, we are not convinced by the\ngovernment\u2019s premise: that Gordon may challenge the PACT\nAct only \u201cas applied\u201d against his sales into jurisdictions with\nwhich he lacks minimum contacts. The government points out\nthat a court may find a statute to be invalid on its face only if a\nplaintiff has shown that the Act has no \u201cplainly legitimate\nsweep.\u201d Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Repub. Party, 552\nU.S. 442, 449 (2008) (citation omitted); see also United States\nv. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987) (holding that facial\nchallenges will be sustained only if \u201cno set of circumstances\nexist under which the Act would be valid\u201d). The government\nargues that any facial challenge to the PACT Act must fail\nbecause there is no dispute that the federal government may\ncompel a delivery seller to collect taxes for at least those state\nand local governments with which it has minimum contacts.\nThus, the Act has a \u201cplainly legitimate sweep,\u201d even if it\nsweeps too broadly.\n\n     But when a statute erases the boundaries that define a\nsovereign\u2019s jurisdiction, as the PACT Act does to the\nboundaries of state and local taxing jurisdictions, any\nlegitimate application is pure happenstance. It is perhaps this\nconsideration that has led the Supreme Court to sustain facial\nchallenges to laws that omit constitutionally-required\njurisdictional elements, even though all such laws necessarily\nhave a \u201cplainly legitimate sweep.\u201d For example, in United\nStates v. Lopez, the Supreme Court struck down the Gun-Free\n\f                                31\n\nSchool Zones Act of 1990, a federal law that prohibited\nindividuals from knowingly possessing firearms within school\nzones. 514 U.S. 549, 551 (1995). The text of the statute\n\u201ccontain[ed] no jurisdictional element which would ensure,\nthrough case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in\nquestion affects interstate commerce.\u201d Id. at 561; see also\nUnited States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 613 (2000) (relying\non Lopez to sustain a facial challenge to the Violence Against\nWomen Act). Similarly, if Gordon\u2019s due process analysis is\ncorrect, the PACT Act contains \u201cno jurisdictional element\nwhich would ensure\u201d that the taxes it imposes comport with the\nDue Process Clause. It permits state and local taxing powers to\nbleed over from legitimate objects of taxation to cover objects\nforeign to the state or local jurisdiction. Following the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s lead, we are not willing to hold \u2013 at the preliminary\ninjunction stage \u2013 that Gordon is unable to maintain a facial\nchallenge.\n\n                                IV\n\n    We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of\nGordon\u2019s remaining claims. See Schrader v. Holder, 704 F.3d\n980, 984 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\n\n                                A\n\n    Gordon argues that Section 2a violates the Tenth\nAmendment by commandeering states to administer a federal\ntaxation scheme. 11 The district court properly dismissed this\nTenth Amendment challenge for failure to state a claim for\n\n    11\n        Gordon has standing to bring a claim that he was injured by\nCongress\u2019s \u201cdisregard of the federal structure of our Government,\u201d\nas reflected in the Tenth Amendment. See Bond v. United States, __\nU.S. __, 131 S. Ct. 2355, 2366-67 (2011).\n\f                               32\n\nrelief. As the government points out, the type of burden the\nPACT Act creates is different in kind from the burdens the\nSupreme Court held to violate the Tenth Amendment in New\nYork v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), and Printz v.\nUnited States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997).\n\n     This is not a case in which \u201cthe Federal Government [is]\ncompel[ling] the States to implement, by legislation or\nexecutive action, federal regulatory programs.\u201d Printz, 521\nU.S. at 925. Instead of drafting states to enforce federal law,\nthe PACT Act pledges the federal government to enforce state\nlaw. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 377 (imposing federal criminal penalties\nfor violating the delivery sale provisions of the PACT Act).\nStates may still craft their tax codes to accomplish their own\npolicy goals. If a state wishes to increase tobacco consumption\nor to promote its use among minors, it retains the discretion to\ndo so.\n\n     In fact, the challenged provisions of the PACT Act do not\ndirect the states to do anything. Any administrative burden that\nresults is merely incidental to Congress\u2019s lawful exercise of its\npower to regulate the private participants in interstate\ncommerce. In New York, the Court left open the possibility that\nCongress could pursue permissible policy goals by directly\nregulating private parties rather than states. 505 U.S. at 159-60.\nThat is what Congress has done here.\n\n     The affirmative burdens placed on the states in Printz and\nNew York were unavoidable. By contrast, states may avoid any\nburdens imposed by the PACT Act \u2013 a distinction the Supreme\nCourt has treated as constitutionally significant. In FERC v.\nMississippi, for example, the Court rejected a Tenth\nAmendment challenge to a federal statute that called for states\nto consider federal standards in regulating public utilities. 456\nU.S. 742 (1982). The Court emphasized that \u201cif a State has no\n\f                               33\n\nutilities commission, or simply stops regulating in the field, it\nneed not even entertain the federal proposals.\u201d Id. at 764; see\nalso Hodel v. Va. Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass\u2019n, Inc.,\n452 U.S. 264, 288 (1981) (affirming a federal statute with\nsimilar reasoning). The Court in New York distinguished FERC\nv. Mississippi on these grounds, noting that there was nothing\nin the law at issue in FERC \u201cdirectly compelling\u201d the state to\nparticipate in the federal regulatory program. New York, 505\nU.S. at 161-62; see also Printz, 521 U.S. at 925-26. This case is\nmuch more like FERC than New York. If states wish to tax\ndelivery sales of tobacco products, they may have to answer\nthe federal call to accept pre-paid taxes from out-of-state\nsellers. Still, they may avoid that federal mandate altogether by\nnot taxing tobacco delivery sales. Congress may lawfully\npresent states with this Hobson\u2019s choice because it has the\npower to prevent states from taxing interstate commerce\naltogether. See FERC, 456 U.S. at 759.\n\n     Additionally, the PACT Act does not blur the lines of\npolitical accountability as did the statute challenged in New\nYork, 505 U.S. at 169. Here, states still freely set the tax rates\nfor which they may be held accountable. And because the Act\napplies directly to the sellers, it is clear that Congress is the\nsource of the new duty, not the states. See United States v.\nMorrison, 529 U.S. 598, 654 n.21 (2000) (Souter, J.,\ndissenting) (\u201cHad Congress chosen . . . to proceed instead by\nregulating the States, rather than private individuals, this\naccountability would be far less plain.\u201d).\n\n     The PACT Act regulates individuals, not states; its only\nincidental effect on the states is to require them to collect\nadditional tax revenue if they choose to join Congress in\nregulating interstate commerce in tobacco products. This sort\nof burden is constitutionally permissible.\n\f                                34\n\n                                B\n\n    The district court also properly dismissed Gordon\u2019s Fifth\nAmendment challenge to the PACT Act\u2019s ban on shipping\ntobacco products in the U.S. mail. Gordon argues that the ban\ndeprives him of due process and the equal protection of the\nlaws.\n\n     There is no dispute that the district court properly applied\nrational basis review to the mail ban. Accordingly, Gordon has\na claim only if he can show that there is no \u201crational\nrelationship between [the ban] and some legitimate\ngovernmental purpose.\u201d Am. Bus. Ass\u2019n v. Rogoff, 649 F.3d\n734, 742 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). This burden \u201cto\nnegative every conceivable basis which might support\u201d the law\nis especially difficult to meet. FCC v. Beach Commc\u2019ns, Inc.,\n508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993). Rational basis review \u201cis not a\nlicense for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of\nlegislative choices.\u201d Id. at 313. Courts must uphold legislation\n\u201c[e]ven if the classification involved . . . is to some extent both\nunderinclusive and overinclusive . . . .\u201d Vance v. Bradley, 440\nU.S. 93, 108 (1979). In the ordinary case, \u201ca law will be\nsustained if it can be said to advance a legitimate government\ninterest, even if the law seems unwise or works to the\ndisadvantage of a particular group, or if the rationale for it\nseems tenuous.\u201d Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 632 (1996).\n\n     Gordon argues that this is no ordinary case because\nCongress has never before banned the shipment of a product\nthat is legal in all fifty states and does not present a danger to\nthe mail or mail carriers. Appellee\u2019s Br. 47. Unprecedented\nlaws, he asserts, are subject to more \u201ccareful\u201d rational basis\nreview under Romer v. Evans. Appellee\u2019s Br. 50; see also\nRomer, 517 U.S. at 633 (discussing the unprecedented nature\nof the law under review). We need not decide whether Romer\n\f                                35\n\nannounced such a rule because the mail ban is not\nunprecedented. The government provides \u2013 and Gordon fails to\ndistinguish \u2013 several examples of articles Congress has banned\nfrom the U.S. mail that are legal in all fifty states and do not\npresent a danger to the mail or mail carriers. See, e.g., 39\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3002 (making vehicle master keys nonmailable); id.\n\u00a7 3002a (making locksmithing devices nonmailable). We\ntherefore examine this law as we examine any other law that\ndoes not infringe on a fundamental right or involve a suspect\nclassification.\n\n     Although we are by no means restricted to the stated\nreasons for passing a law in our search for a \u201crational basis,\u201d\nBeach Commc\u2019ns, 508 U.S. at 315, we need look no further\nthan the statute itself to discern three rational bases for the mail\nban. As we observed in Gordon I, Section 1 of the Act reveals\nthat it was \u201caimed primarily at combating three evils: tobacco\nsales to minors, [illicit] cigarette trafficking, and\ncircumvention of state taxation requirements.\u201d 632 F.3d at 723\n(citing Pub. L. No. 111-154, \u00a7 1(b)). Gordon does not dispute\nthat these purposes are \u201clegitimate governmental purposes,\u201d\nbut argues that the mail ban fails to advance them because it is\nduplicative, overinclusive in some ways, and underinclusive in\nothers. His arguments ask us to engage in a higher level of\nscrutiny than rational basis review allows.\n\n     For example, Gordon argues that Congress could have\naccomplished the goal of preventing illicit cigarette trafficking\nby enhancing penalties for violations of existing laws, rather\nthan broadly excluding both licit and illicit tobacco deliveries\nfrom the mail. Once again, the legislative record reveals a\nrational basis for choosing one path over the other: delivery\nsellers \u201chave been very successful at eluding traditional\nenforcement measures, by making their cigarette and\nsmokeless tobacco deliveries by mail.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 111-117,\n\f                               36\n\nat 19 (2009). Our standard of review does not permit us to\nsecond-guess the wisdom of that choice.\n\n     With respect to sales to minors, Gordon argues that the\nmail ban is duplicative because Congress promulgated age\nverification requirements in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 376a(b)(4). Yet his\nnext argument betrays an awareness that age verification\nrequirements are only partially effective. He claims that the\nmail ban is underinclusive because it does not cover underage\nsales that occur at brick and mortar stores, which are also\nsubject to age verification requirements. See Appellee\u2019s Br. 54\nn.14 (citing Tobacco Free Kids Org., Where Do Youth Smokers\nGet Their Cigarettes?, http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/resear\nch/factsheets/pdf/0073.pdf (last accessed June 7, 2013)). But\nCongress \u201cmust be allowed leeway to approach a perceived\nproblem incrementally.\u201d Beach Commc\u2019ns, 508 U.S. at 316.\nCongress\u2019s judgment that the existing enforcement\nmechanisms must be supplemented by the partial solution of a\nmail ban is entirely rational.\n\n     Finally, Gordon argues that the mail ban is duplicative\nbecause the tax provisions already effectively prevent\ncircumvention of state taxes. But as we note above, Congress\nconcluded that the mail enables determined sellers to evade the\nlaw \u2013 including, presumably, the PACT Act\u2019s command that\nsellers pay state and local taxes in advance of the sale. It is\nentirely rational for Congress to buttress other legal provisions\nby closing a popular channel for noncompliant commerce.\n\n    Because Gordon has not met his high burden \u201cto negative\nevery conceivable basis\u201d for the Act, Beach Commc\u2019ns, 508\nU.S at 315, the district court was correct to dismiss Gordon\u2019s\nclaim. And because the only challenge to the mail ban was\nproperly dismissed, we need not decide whether the district\n\f                              37\n\ncourt should have granted a preliminary injunction against the\nmail ban.\n\n                               V\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s decision is\naffirmed and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f     KAVANAUGH, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment\nin part and dissenting in part: The majority opinion holds\nthat key tax-related provisions of the Prevent All Cigarette\nTrafficking Act may be unconstitutional under the Due\nProcess Clause\u2019s minimum contacts principle. The majority\nopinion therefore affirms the District Court\u2019s preliminary\ninjunction barring the Federal Government from enforcing\nthose provisions of the statute. I respectfully disagree. To\nobtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must show, among\nother things, a likelihood of success on the merits. In my\nview, Gordon\u2019s Due Process Clause claim lacks merit. I\nwould therefore vacate the preliminary injunction entered by\nthe District Court.\n\n     In 2010, Congress passed and President Obama signed\nthe Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act. That law requires\ncigarette sellers to comply with various state tax laws. The\nlaw was prompted by Congress\u2019s finding that Internet\ncigarette sellers were not complying with federal, state, and\nlocal tax laws, resulting in billions of dollars in lost tax\nrevenue each year.        Importantly for present purposes,\nviolations of the Act are subject to federal criminal\nprosecution or federal civil suit. In such federal lawsuits, the\nUnited States is the relevant sovereign and jurisdiction. As I\nwill explain, when the Federal Government (not a State)\nregulates a U.S. seller such as Gordon, there is no Due\nProcess Clause minimum contacts issue.\n\n     To begin, it is well-settled that Congress may enact\nfederal laws that require sellers of a product to comply with\ncertain state laws. So long as the federal law is otherwise\njustified under the Constitution \u2013 for example, as a Commerce\nClause regulation of commercial activity \u2013 the fact that the\nfederal law piggy-backs on state law in this fashion is\nirrelevant. The Supreme Court has long upheld federal laws\nof that sort. See Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v. Illinois\nCentral Railroad Co., 299 U.S. 334 (1937); Clark Distilling\n\f                                2\nCo. v. Western Maryland Railway Co., 242 U.S. 311 (1917).\nA number of federal laws follow that model. See, e.g., 7\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1571, 1573 (no transfer of agricultural seeds into a\nState in violation of state law); 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 3372(a)(2) (no\ntransfer of wildlife taken in violation of any state law); 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 842(c) (no transfer of explosives into a State where\nthey are illegal under state law); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b)(2) (no\ntransfer of firearms into a State where they are illegal under\nstate law); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 831(b) (online pharmacies must\ncomply with the law of any State in which they do business or\noffer to do business); 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5362(10)(A) (no online bets\ncan be accepted where the bet is illegal in the State in which it\nis made); see also United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440\nU.S. 715, 728 (1979) (\u201cstate law may be incorporated as the\nfederal rule of decision\u201d); Board of County Commissioners of\nthe County of Jackson, Kansas v. United States, 308 U.S. 343,\n351-52 (1939) (\u201cthe state law has been absorbed, as it were,\nas the governing federal rule not because state law was the\nsource of the right but because recognition of state interests\nwas not deemed inconsistent with federal policy\u201d); Henry M.\nHart, Jr., The Relations Between State and Federal Law, 54\nCOLUM. L. REV. 489, 498 (1954) (\u201cCongress rarely enacts a\ncomplete and self-sufficient body of federal law. The federal\nstatutes are full of references, both explicit and implicit, to the\nlaw of some state.\u201d) (footnote omitted).\n\n    There is no dispute here that the relevant provisions of\nthe Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act are valid under the\nCommerce Clause.        The question concerns the law\u2019s\ncompliance with the minimum contacts principle of the Due\nProcess Clause.\n\n    When Congress enacts a federal law of this kind and\nrenders violators of that law subject to federal criminal\nprosecution or federal civil suit, the law does not violate the\n\f                                3\nminimum contacts principle of the Due Process Clause. The\nreason is quite simple: In such federal-law cases, the relevant\nsovereign and jurisdiction is the United States, not one of the\nindividual States. There is no Due Process minimum contacts\nissue raised by a federal-law suit against a seller located in the\nUnited States. That was the conclusion reached by a three-\njudge District Court in this Circuit when it rejected a similar\nDue Process Clause minimum contacts challenge to the\nJenkins Act. That Act required cigarette shippers to report\nout-of-state sales to the buyer\u2019s state tobacco administrator.\nThe Supreme Court summarily affirmed the Court\u2019s decision.\nSee Consumer Mail Order Association of America v.\nMcGrath, 94 F. Supp. 705, 712 (D.D.C. 1950), aff\u2019d, 340 U.S.\n925 (1951). I would reach the same conclusion here. See\nMusser\u2019s Inc. v. United States, 2011 WL 4467784, at *5 (E.D.\nPa. 2011) (denying preliminary injunction in Due Process\nClause challenge to Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act).\n\n    To be sure, a seller like Gordon may raise a Due Process\nClause minimum contacts objection in any state-law\nproceeding. See Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298\n(1992). But the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act does\nnot negate a seller\u2019s ability to raise a Due Process Clause\nminimum contacts objection in state-law cases.\n\n    In my view, therefore, Gordon\u2019s Due Process Clause\nclaim is entirely without merit. 1 To grant a preliminary\ninjunction, however, a District Court must find a likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, among other things. See Winter v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)\n\n    1\n       The alternative Tenth Amendment argument advanced by\nGordon in support of the preliminary injunction is likewise without\nmerit, as the majority opinion explains and the District Court also\nconcluded.\n\f                               4\n(\u201cA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish\nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits . . . .\u201d); Munaf v.\nGeren, 553 U.S. 674, 690 (2008) (\u201ca party seeking a\npreliminary injunction must demonstrate, among other things,\na likelihood of success on the merits\u201d) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Davis v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.,\n571 F.3d 1288, 1296 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, J.,\nconcurring) (\u201cIn light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent\ndecisions, I tend to agree . . . that the old sliding-scale\napproach to preliminary injunctions \u2013 under which a very\nstrong likelihood of success could make up for a failure to\nshow a likelihood of irreparable harm, or vice versa \u2013 is no\nlonger controlling, or even viable. It appears that a party\nmoving for a preliminary injunction must meet four\nindependent requirements.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted); cf. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 438 (2009)\n(Kennedy, J., concurring) (\u201cWhen considering success on the\nmerits and irreparable harm, courts cannot dispense with the\nrequired showing of one simply because there is a strong\nlikelihood of the other.\u201d).\n\n     When, as here, a District Court incorrectly finds a\nlikelihood of success on the merits, that legal error constitutes\nan abuse of discretion, and we must vacate the preliminary\ninjunction. See Kiyemba v. Obama, 561 F.3d 509, 513 (D.C.\nCir. 2009) (\u201cIf the moving party can show no likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits, then preliminary relief is obviously\nimproper and the appellant is entitled to reversal of the order\nas a matter of law.\u201d); Air Line Pilots Association International\nv. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 863 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1988)\n(\u201cWe reverse the district court and hold that it should not have\ngranted the motions for a preliminary injunction because the\nunions did not show a substantial likelihood of success on the\nmerits.\u201d); see generally So v. Suchanek, 670 F.3d 1304, 1310\n(D.C. Cir. 2012) (\u201cA district court by definition abuses its\n\f                                5\ndiscretion when it makes an error of law.\u201d) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). 2\n\n     Because Gordon\u2019s Due Process Clause claim is meritless,\nI would vacate the District Court\u2019s preliminary injunction\nagainst enforcement of the tax-related provisions of the Act.\nAs to Gordon\u2019s cross-appeal challenging the District Court\u2019s\ndenial of a preliminary injunction to enjoin enforcement of\nthe Act\u2019s mailing ban on Fifth Amendment grounds, I would\naffirm the District Court because Gordon has not shown a\nlikelihood of success on the merits of that claim, for reasons\nthe majority opinion explains.\n\n\n\n\n    2\n      In certain First Amendment cases, the Supreme Court has\nsaid that a court of appeals may affirm a District Court\u2019s\npreliminary injunction so long as the plaintiff has presented a\n\u201cclose\u201d question on the merits. See Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S.\n656, 664-65 (2004). But the \u201cclose\u201d question standard is not the\nusual rule for preliminary injunctions or for appellate review of\npreliminary injunctions. And even if a close question were enough,\nGordon has not presented a close question here.\n\f     SENTELLE, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment: I reluctantly concur in the result\nannounced in Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion. While this case may not\nbe moot, it is not entirely clear what it is the parties are still\nlitigating about, and I hope that the district court re-examines the\nmootness question with the benefit of a more full record.\n\n    I do not join fully in Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion because I\nthink it opines on matters far beyond the issues before the court,\nand I do not wish to elevate those opinions to circuit law.\n\n     First, footnote 1 of Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion indulges, I think\nquite gratuitously, in a discussion of the effect of the so-called\n\u201cDormant Commerce Clause.\u201d So far as I can tell, no party in\nthis case relies upon the Dormant Commerce Clause, the\nDormant Commerce Clause is not relied upon in the briefs, the\nDormant Commerce Clause has nothing to do with the result,\nand this case has nothing to do with the Dormant Commerce\nClause.\n\n     Further, I cannot support Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion in its test\nof \u201cdemocratic legitimacy\u201d for the minimum contacts necessary\nto provide due process for taxation. Griffith op. at 19 21. The\nsearch for democratic underpinnings for constitutional\nprovisions may be academically interesting, but I find no case in\nwhich this court, the Supreme Court, or any other federal court\nhas undertaken that search before affirming the legitimacy of a\ntax. Because Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion supplies sufficient indicia\nof minimum contacts without relying on this novel approach, I\njoin the result, indeed I join most of the opinion, but I cannot\nfully join the elevation to circuit law of a new test for minimum\ncontacts, or of the discussion of the attributes of the \u201cDormant\nCommerce Clause.\u201d\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\"> United States Court of Appeals\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n\n\nArgued October 22, 2012              Decided June 28, 2013\n\n                       No. 12-5031\n\n                     ROBERT GORDON,\n                        APPELLEE\n\n                             v.\n\nERIC H.

In the district\ncourt, Gordon sought a preliminary injunction against the\nenforcement of provisions of the Prevent All Cigarette\nTrafficking Act (PACT Act) that require him to pay state and\nlocal taxes and ban him from sending his products through the\nU.S. mail. Gordon argues that the tax provisions violate the\nDue Process Clause and the Tenth Amendment and that the\n\f                                 5\n\nmail ban runs afoul of the Due Process and Equal Protection\nClauses.\n\n    The district court enjoined the enforcement of the tax\nprovisions on due process grounds, but otherwise dismissed\nGordon\u2019s claims. The government appeals the preliminary\ninjunction, and Gordon cross-appeals the district court\u2019s\ndismissal of, and refusal to grant a preliminary injunction for,\nhis remaining claims. For the reasons set forth below, we\naffirm the district court\u2019s decision in its entirety.\n\n                                 I\n\n                                A\n\n     In most states, the liability for sales and use taxes falls\nprimarily on the buyer.

When they cannot rely on retailers to collect taxes, states\nfind it both expensive and difficult to track the smaller\nout-of-state purchases of their residents and to collect the\napplicable taxes directly from them. This creates an\nopportunity for tax evasion that is especially costly when it\ncomes to goods like tobacco products that are taxed at high\nrates. GAO Report, supra, at 7. In an effort to eliminate this\nopportunity for tobacco buyers, Congress passed the Jenkins\nAct, which obligates retailers to report each interstate sale of\ntobacco products to the tax authority of the consumer\u2019s state.\nPub. L. No. 81-363, 63 Stat. 884 (1949).\n\n     More than a half century has elapsed since the passage of\nthe Jenkins Act, and as the Internet has made it easier for\nconsumers to order tobacco products from out-of-state sellers,\nit has become more difficult for states and localities to collect\ntaxes on these transactions.

After\nstarting his business in 2002, Gordon accepted orders in\nperson, over the phone, and occasionally online. At the height\nof his business, Gordon took in two million dollars in revenue\nevery month. Ninety-five percent of that revenue came from\n\f                                 8\n\nsales to customers outside of New York. Gordon claims,\nhowever, that he has never made a sale into some state and\nlocal taxing jurisdictions within the United States. See Marcia\nGordon Second Decl. \u00b6 13.\n\n     Gordon asserts that his business has suffered under the\nPACT Act. Until recently, Gordon has enjoyed the protection\nof a Western District of New York preliminary injunction\nagainst the enforcement of the tax provisions, 2 but the mail\nban has taken its toll. The major private carriers \u2013 Federal\nExpress, United Parcel Service, and DHL \u2013 also refuse to\ndeliver tobacco products, leaving Gordon with only more\nexpensive couriers. On May 30, 2013, while this appeal was\npending, Gordon notified the court that he has found it\nnecessary to close his business.\n\n                                 C\n\n    Gordon\u2019s case has been before us already.

This argument presents two substantial and\nnovel constitutional questions. First, does the Due Process\nClause require minimum contacts between the state or local\ntaxing authority and the nonresident seller even when the\nfederal government is the source of the seller\u2019s duty to collect\ntaxes? And second, if due process requires minimum contacts\nwith the state or local taxing jurisdiction, does a single delivery\nsale to a buyer in that jurisdiction create minimum contacts?\nBoth are questions of law, but they are matters of first\nimpression, and their resolution would benefit from fuller\nfactual development below. See Pearson, 555 U.S. at 239.

See Quill, 504 U.S. at\n319 (Scalia, J., concurring) (collecting cases).\n\f                                14\n\nenforces the obligation (in this case, the federal government)?\nGordon and the government think that the question can be\nresolved by reference to precedent. We do not. This question is\nnovel and close, and we cannot say that the district court\u2019s\nconclusion that Gordon is likely to succeed on the merits is an\nabuse of discretion. We are therefore bound to affirm its\ndetermination. See Ashcroft, 542 U.S. at 664-65.\n\n     For its part, the government argues that the Act is\nconstitutional because Gordon has minimum contacts with the\nfederal government, the sovereign that imposed and will\nenforce his tax obligations. The government correctly points\nout that this is not the first time a seller has challenged\nCongress\u2019s power to oblige participants in interstate commerce\nto comply with state-defined duties.

Because Congress\u2019s \u201cwill\u201d\nconverts the state taxes into federal duties, the argument goes,\nthe Due Process Clause demands minimum contacts only\nbetween Gordon and the federal government.\n\n     The government\u2019s argument overlooks an important\ndistinction: The challenges to the federal statutes at issue in\nJames Clark Distilling Company and Kentucky Whip & Collar\nCompany were brought under the Commerce Clause; unlike\nGordon\u2019s challenge, they raised no issue of minimum contacts\nunder the Due Process Clause. 6 See James Clark Distilling\n\n     6\n        The parties in those cases raised due process challenges, but\nnot of the sort we consider here.

No doctor would prescribe penicillin\nfor a broken arm; nor will we uncritically hand out the\nSupreme Court\u2019s Commerce Clause prescription when a\nlitigant comes to us complaining of a due process injury.\nCongress\u2019s \u201cwill\u201d might cure the due process injury that would\notherwise arise if the states tried unilaterally to impose taxes on\nGordon.

The Court has long held that mere contact through the U.S.\nmail provides the \u201cminimum contact\u201d required for a state to assert\nregulatory, as distinguished from taxation, jurisdiction.

(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n     Sensitive to the distinctions between the Due Process and\nCommerce Clauses, Gordon argues that the answer to this\nquestion is found in the principles set out in Quill Corp. v.\nNorth Dakota, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112739\"><a href=\"/opinion/112739/quill-corp-v-north-dakota/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992). In Quill, an out-of-state\nmail-order catalogue business challenged a state law that\ncompelled \u201cevery person who engages in regular or systematic\nsolicitation of a consumer market in\u201d North Dakota to collect\nuse taxes from its customers and remit them to the state. Id. at\n302-03 (internal quotation marks omitted). Even though Quill\nwas a Delaware corporation with no physical presence in North\nDakota, the state statute required the company to collect North\nDakota use taxes because it engaged in \u201cregular or systematic\nsolicitation\u201d in the state, as defined by the statute. Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Quill challenged the law under the\nDue Process and Commerce Clauses. Id. at 303-04. Before\naddressing these separate challenges, the Court discussed the\ndifferences between the clauses as they relate to the state\u2019s\npower to regulate an entity located in another state. Id. at\n305-06. In dicta, the Court explained: \u201cWhile Congress . . .\nmay authorize state actions that burden interstate commerce, it\ndoes not similarly have the power to authorize violations of the\nDue Process Clause.\u201d Id. at 305 (internal citations omitted).\nThen, the Court set out the fundamental rule that the Due\nProcess Clause requires minimum contacts between the taxing\nsovereign and the taxed entity. Id. at 306. Taken together,\nGordon argues, the legal principles set forth in Quill prohibit\nCongress from imposing state or local taxes on out-of-state\nsellers who lack minimum contacts with the state or locality.\n\n    Even the government concedes that, after Quill, Congress\nmay not authorize a state to impose the duty to collect state use\ntaxes on delivery sellers lacking minimum contacts with the\n\f                                 18\n\nstate. But that is not what the PACT Act does. Section 2a does\nnot address itself to states at all. Rather than authorizing the\nstates to impose on Gordon a state duty to collect state taxes,\nthe PACT Act imposes on Gordon a federal duty to collect\nstate taxes. States would enforce their own taxes if Congress\nmerely authorized them to tax, whereas they must rely on the\nfederal government to do so under the PACT Act. Because this\ndistinction may make all the difference under the Due Process\nClause, the precedent on which Gordon relies does not resolve\nour constitutional question.\n\n    Finding no conclusive precedent, we turn to first\nprinciples and there find support for Gordon\u2019s argument that\ndue process requires minimum contacts with the state or local\ngovernment that defines the tax. 7 At its most basic level, \u201c[t]he\n\n     7\n       My concurring colleague asserts that no court has \u201cundertaken\nth[is] search before affirming the legitimacy of a tax.\u201d Post, at 1\n(Sentelle, J., concurring). We need look no further than Quill to find\nan example of the Supreme Court returning to first principles to\nunderstand what type of \u201cminimum contacts\u201d serve to legitimate a\nstate tax.

And as this discussion reveals, the PACT Act has been\ncast in a mold that has never been constitutionally tested. We\nare unwilling to resolve such an important and novel\nconstitutional question without the benefit of further factual\ndevelopment.\n\n     Before we may affirm the preliminary injunction,\nhowever, we must address the second constitutional question\nthat informed the district court\u2019s conclusion that Gordon is\nlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim.\n\n                                2\n\n     Under Section 2a of the PACT Act, Gordon\u2019s obligation to\ncollect a given state or local tax attaches when he initiates a\ntransaction within that jurisdiction. Gordon\u2019s due process\nchallenge presents the question whether a single sale is enough\nto establish minimum contacts with that jurisdiction. The\ngovernment asserts it is, providing a constitutional basis for the\nAct even if Gordon is correct that the Due Process Clause\ndemands minimum contacts with the state or local taxing\nauthority. Appellants\u2019 Br. 30-33. Once again, the question is a\nclose one, deserving of further development at a trial on the\nmerits, so we affirm and remand.

In National\nBellas Hess v.

Co., 347 U.S. at 344-45. National Bellas\nHess was commonly understood to require that the seller have\nsome \u201cphysical presence\u201d in the taxing state. Quill, 504 U.S. at\n306-07. Thirty years later, in Quill, the Supreme Court\noverruled that holding. Id. at 308. Relying on \u201ccomparable\u201d\nreasoning in cases concerning the personal jurisdiction of\ncourts, the Court concluded that North Dakota\u2019s imposition of\na duty to collect a use tax on Quill did not violate the Due\nProcess Clause, even though Quill\u2019s only contacts with citizens\nof North Dakota occurred by means of mail or common carrier.\nId. The court relied on the fact that Quill purposefully directed\nits activities at residents of North Dakota, that it had conducted\na high volume of business with customers in that state, and that\nthe use tax was \u201crelated to the benefits Quill receives from\naccess to the state.\u201d Id.\n\n     But \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has never found \u2018that a single\nisolated sale . . . is sufficient\u2019\u201d to establish minimum contacts.\nRed Earth, 657 F.3d at 145 (quoting J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd.,\n131 S. Ct. at 2792 (Breyer, J., concurring)). While it may prove\nto be the case that, in the Internet age, a single sale establishes\n\u201cminimum contacts\u201d as a matter of law, this seems like\nprecisely the sort of difficult constitutional question on which\nour analysis would benefit from factual development. For\nexample, how difficult is it for a delivery seller to identify and\ncalculate applicable taxes at the point of sale? What sorts of\n\f                                  26\n\nservices do states provide to delivery sellers (e.g., a forum for\ncollecting debts from buyers, trash disposal for shipping\ncartons)? Without this knowledge, we find no reason to upset\nthe district court\u2019s reasonable conclusion that Gordon has\ndemonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his due\nprocess challenge to the tax provisions of the PACT Act.

(internal citation omitted). The district court did\nnot abuse its discretion by concluding that Gordon had\ndemonstrated such a threat: when he was in business, the Act\nrequired Gordon to pay what he alleges are unconstitutional\ntaxes or else risk criminal and civil penalties.\n\n     Similarly, the district court concluded that \u201ca potential\ndeprivation of [Gordon\u2019s] constitutional right to due\nprocess . . . outweighs the possible injury to defendants from\nenjoining enforcement until the merits of Gordon\u2019s claim can\nbe determined.\u201d Gordon, 826 F. Supp. 2d at 297. Although the\npreliminary injunction might temporarily frustrate the federal\ngovernment\u2019s interest in enforcing state and local tax laws, the\ndistrict court permissibly gave greater weight to the possibility\nthat Gordon could suffer an ongoing constitutional violation\nwhile this litigation proceeds.\n\f                               29\n\n     Now that Gordon\u2019s business has ceased operations, he\narguably no longer faces the dilemma on which the district\ncourt based its finding of irreparable injury. Neither does the\ngovernment face the prospect of watching Gordon\u2019s cigarette\nsales go untaxed. As the administrator of the injunction, the\ndistrict court is better placed than we are to judge its ongoing\nnecessity. Our charge in a \u00a7 1292(a)(1) appeal is limited to\ndetermining whether the district court acted within its\ndiscretion by issuing the preliminary injunction in the first\ninstance. Finding no abuse of discretion, we decline the\ngovernment\u2019s invitation to vacate the injunction. In reaching\nthat decision, we are sensitive to the gravity of enjoining an act\nof Congress, even temporarily. The government remains free\nto petition the district court for relief from the preliminary\ninjunction in light of the changed circumstances. See FED. R.\nCIV. P. 60(b) (empowering the district court to \u201crelieve a party\u201d\nfrom an order).\n\n                               III\n\n     Before we turn to the claims the district court dismissed,\nwe must consider the government\u2019s argument that the\npreliminary injunction is overbroad. The government argues\nthat the injunction, which bars it from enforcing the tax\nprovisions against Gordon at all, should have prohibited it only\nfrom enforcing the provisions against Gordon\u2019s sales into\njurisdictions with which he lacks minimum contacts. We hold\nthat the district court adequately fulfilled its duty to \u201cmaintain\nthe act in so far as it is valid.\u201d Red Earth, 657 F.3d at 145\n(quoting Alaska Airlines, Inc. v.

By demanding that the injunction be narrower, the\ngovernment asks the district court to put the cart before the\nhorse.

It is perhaps this\nconsideration that has led the Supreme Court to sustain facial\nchallenges to laws that omit constitutionally-required\njurisdictional elements, even though all such laws necessarily\nhave a \u201cplainly legitimate sweep.\u201d For example, in United\nStates v.

Instead of drafting states to enforce federal law,\nthe PACT Act pledges the federal government to enforce state\nlaw. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 377 (imposing federal criminal penalties\nfor violating the delivery sale provisions of the PACT Act).\nStates may still craft their tax codes to accomplish their own\npolicy goals. If a state wishes to increase tobacco consumption\nor to promote its use among minors, it retains the discretion to\ndo so.\n\n     In fact, the challenged provisions of the PACT Act do not\ndirect the states to do anything. Any administrative burden that\nresults is merely incidental to Congress\u2019s lawful exercise of its\npower to regulate the private participants in interstate\ncommerce. In New York, the Court left open the possibility that\nCongress could pursue permissible policy goals by directly\nregulating private parties rather than states. 505 U.S. at 159-60.\nThat is what Congress has done here.\n\n     The affirmative burdens placed on the states in Printz and\nNew York were unavoidable. By contrast, states may avoid any\nburdens imposed by the PACT Act \u2013 a distinction the Supreme\nCourt has treated as constitutionally significant. In FERC v.\nMississippi, for example, the Court rejected a Tenth\nAmendment challenge to a federal statute that called for states\nto consider federal standards in regulating public utilities. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110718\"><a href=\"/opinion/110718/ferc-v-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982).

The Court in New York distinguished FERC\nv. Mississippi on these grounds, noting that there was nothing\nin the law at issue in FERC \u201cdirectly compelling\u201d the state to\nparticipate in the federal regulatory program. New York, 505\nU.S. at 161-62; see also Printz, 521 U.S. at 925-26. This case is\nmuch more like FERC than New York. If states wish to tax\ndelivery sales of tobacco products, they may have to answer\nthe federal call to accept pre-paid taxes from out-of-state\nsellers. Still, they may avoid that federal mandate altogether by\nnot taxing tobacco delivery sales. Congress may lawfully\npresent states with this Hobson\u2019s choice because it has the\npower to prevent states from taxing interstate commerce\naltogether. See FERC, 456 U.S. at 759.\n\n     Additionally, the PACT Act does not blur the lines of\npolitical accountability as did the statute challenged in New\nYork, 505 U.S. at 169. Here, states still freely set the tax rates\nfor which they may be held accountable. And because the Act\napplies directly to the sellers, it is clear that Congress is the\nsource of the new duty, not the states.

Appellee\u2019s Br. 47. Unprecedented\nlaws, he asserts, are subject to more \u201ccareful\u201d rational basis\nreview under Romer v. Evans. Appellee\u2019s Br. 50; see also\nRomer, 517 U.S. at 633 (discussing the unprecedented nature\nof the law under review). We need not decide whether Romer\n\f                                35\n\nannounced such a rule because the mail ban is not\nunprecedented. The government provides \u2013 and Gordon fails to\ndistinguish \u2013 several examples of articles Congress has banned\nfrom the U.S. mail that are legal in all fifty states and do not\npresent a danger to the mail or mail carriers. See, e.g., 39\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3002 (making vehicle master keys nonmailable); id.\n\u00a7 3002a (making locksmithing devices nonmailable). We\ntherefore examine this law as we examine any other law that\ndoes not infringe on a fundamental right or involve a suspect\nclassification.\n\n     Although we are by no means restricted to the stated\nreasons for passing a law in our search for a \u201crational basis,\u201d\nBeach Commc\u2019ns, 508 U.S. at 315, we need look no further\nthan the statute itself to discern three rational bases for the mail\nban. As we observed in Gordon I, Section 1 of the Act reveals\nthat it was \u201caimed primarily at combating three evils: tobacco\nsales to minors, [illicit] cigarette trafficking, and\ncircumvention of state taxation requirements.\u201d 632 F.3d at 723\n(citing Pub. L. No. 111-154, \u00a7 1(b)). Gordon does not dispute\nthat these purposes are \u201clegitimate governmental purposes,\u201d\nbut argues that the mail ban fails to advance them because it is\nduplicative, overinclusive in some ways, and underinclusive in\nothers. His arguments ask us to engage in a higher level of\nscrutiny than rational basis review allows.\n\n     For example, Gordon argues that Congress could have\naccomplished the goal of preventing illicit cigarette trafficking\nby enhancing penalties for violations of existing laws, rather\nthan broadly excluding both licit and illicit tobacco deliveries\nfrom the mail. Once again, the legislative record reveals a\nrational basis for choosing one path over the other: delivery\nsellers \u201chave been very successful at eluding traditional\nenforcement measures, by making their cigarette and\nsmokeless tobacco deliveries by mail.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 111-117,\n\f                               36\n\nat 19 (2009). Our standard of review does not permit us to\nsecond-guess the wisdom of that choice.\n\n     With respect to sales to minors, Gordon argues that the\nmail ban is duplicative because Congress promulgated age\nverification requirements in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 376a(b)(4). Yet his\nnext argument betrays an awareness that age verification\nrequirements are only partially effective. He claims that the\nmail ban is underinclusive because it does not cover underage\nsales that occur at brick and mortar stores, which are also\nsubject to age verification requirements. See Appellee\u2019s Br. 54\nn.14 (citing Tobacco Free Kids Org., Where Do Youth Smokers\nGet Their Cigarettes?, http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/resear\nch/factsheets/pdf/0073.pdf (last accessed June 7, 2013)). But\nCongress \u201cmust be allowed leeway to approach a perceived\nproblem incrementally.\u201d Beach Commc\u2019ns, 508 U.S. at 316.\nCongress\u2019s judgment that the existing enforcement\nmechanisms must be supplemented by the partial solution of a\nmail ban is entirely rational.\n\n     Finally, Gordon argues that the mail ban is duplicative\nbecause the tax provisions already effectively prevent\ncircumvention of state taxes. But as we note above, Congress\nconcluded that the mail enables determined sellers to evade the\nlaw \u2013 including, presumably, the PACT Act\u2019s command that\nsellers pay state and local taxes in advance of the sale. It is\nentirely rational for Congress to buttress other legal provisions\nby closing a popular channel for noncompliant commerce.\n\n    Because Gordon has not met his high burden \u201cto negative\nevery conceivable basis\u201d for the Act, Beach Commc\u2019ns, 508\nU.S at 315, the district court was correct to dismiss Gordon\u2019s\nclaim. And because the only challenge to the mail ban was\nproperly dismissed, we need not decide whether the district\n\f                              37\n\ncourt should have granted a preliminary injunction against the\nmail ban.\n\n                               V\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s decision is\naffirmed and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f     KAVANAUGH, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment\nin part and dissenting in part: The majority opinion holds\nthat key tax-related provisions of the Prevent All Cigarette\nTrafficking Act may be unconstitutional under the Due\nProcess Clause\u2019s minimum contacts principle. The majority\nopinion therefore affirms the District Court\u2019s preliminary\ninjunction barring the Federal Government from enforcing\nthose provisions of the statute. I respectfully disagree. To\nobtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must show, among\nother things, a likelihood of success on the merits. In my\nview, Gordon\u2019s Due Process Clause claim lacks merit. I\nwould therefore vacate the preliminary injunction entered by\nthe District Court.\n\n     In 2010, Congress passed and President Obama signed\nthe Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act. That law requires\ncigarette sellers to comply with various state tax laws. The\nlaw was prompted by Congress\u2019s finding that Internet\ncigarette sellers were not complying with federal, state, and\nlocal tax laws, resulting in billions of dollars in lost tax\nrevenue each year.        Importantly for present purposes,\nviolations of the Act are subject to federal criminal\nprosecution or federal civil suit. In such federal lawsuits, the\nUnited States is the relevant sovereign and jurisdiction. As I\nwill explain, when the Federal Government (not a State)\nregulates a U.S. seller such as Gordon, there is no Due\nProcess Clause minimum contacts issue.\n\n     To begin, it is well-settled that Congress may enact\nfederal laws that require sellers of a product to comply with\ncertain state laws. So long as the federal law is otherwise\njustified under the Constitution \u2013 for example, as a Commerce\nClause regulation of commercial activity \u2013 the fact that the\nfederal law piggy-backs on state law in this fashion is\nirrelevant. The Supreme Court has long upheld federal laws\nof that sort. See Kentucky Whip & Collar Co. v.

ACLU, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137005\"><a href=\"/opinion/137005/ashcroft-v-american-civil-liberties-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664-65 (2004). But the \u201cclose\u201d question standard is not the\nusual rule for preliminary injunctions or for appellate review of\npreliminary injunctions. And even if a close question were enough,\nGordon has not presented a close question here.\n\f     SENTELLE, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment: I reluctantly concur in the result\nannounced in Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion. While this case may not\nbe moot, it is not entirely clear what it is the parties are still\nlitigating about, and I hope that the district court re-examines the\nmootness question with the benefit of a more full record.\n\n    I do not join fully in Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion because I\nthink it opines on matters far beyond the issues before the court,\nand I do not wish to elevate those opinions to circuit law.\n\n     First, footnote 1 of Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion indulges, I think\nquite gratuitously, in a discussion of the effect of the so-called\n\u201cDormant Commerce Clause.\u201d So far as I can tell, no party in\nthis case relies upon the Dormant Commerce Clause, the\nDormant Commerce Clause is not relied upon in the briefs, the\nDormant Commerce Clause has nothing to do with the result,\nand this case has nothing to do with the Dormant Commerce\nClause.\n\n     Further, I cannot support Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion in its test\nof \u201cdemocratic legitimacy\u201d for the minimum contacts necessary\nto provide due process for taxation. Griffith op. at 19 21. The\nsearch for democratic underpinnings for constitutional\nprovisions may be academically interesting, but I find no case in\nwhich this court, the Supreme Court, or any other federal court\nhas undertaken that search before affirming the legitimacy of a\ntax. Because Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion supplies sufficient indicia\nof minimum contacts without relying on this novel approach, I\njoin the result, indeed I join most of the opinion, but I cannot\nfully join the elevation to circuit law of a new test for minimum\ncontacts, or of the discussion of the attributes of the \u201cDormant\nCommerce Clause.\u201d\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
