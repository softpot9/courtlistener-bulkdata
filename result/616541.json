Kellum argues that the district court\nplainly erred in failing to advise him during the rearraignment proceeding of the\npossibility of a forfeiture money judgment being entered against him. He\ncontends that if he had known that his plea could be used to substantiate the\n\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f   Case: 10-50501    Document: 00511651458      Page: 2    Date Filed: 11/01/2011\n\n                                  No. 10-50501\n\nforfeiture judgment, he may not have entered the plea. He asserts that his\nsubstantial rights were violated and that his plea of guilty should be set aside.\n      In evaluating whether an alleged Rule 11 error affects a defendant\u2019s\nsubstantial rights, this court looks to whether there exists a \u201creasonable\nprobability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d United\nStates v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 83 (2004). In making this assessment,\nthe reviewing court looks to the entire record, not to the plea proceedings alone.\nUnited States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 74-75 (2002).\n      A review of the entire record shows that prior to the entry of his guilty\nplea, Kellum had received notice in his indictment that the forfeiture judgment\nwas being sought and had stipulated to the facts necessary to support the\njudgment. In light of this knowledge, there is not a reasonable probability that\nKellum would not have entered the guilty plea if the district court had advised\nhim of the possibility of the forfeiture judgment. Kellum also failed to raise any\nobjection when the Government moved for the money judgment of forfeiture and\ndid not object to the statement contained in the presentence report (PSR)\nconcerning the mandatory forfeiture. Nor did he make an objection when the\nGovernment moved to have the money judgment incorporated in the written\njudgment of conviction and sentence.\n      The record reflects that Kellum had knowledge of the forfeiture\nproceedings prior to his plea and, therefore, he cannot demonstrate that the\ndistrict court\u2019s failure to specifically mention the forfeiture at his rearraignment\nhearing had an effect on his decision to plead guilty. His failure to file any\nchallenges to the Government\u2019s subsequent motion for a money judgment and\nto the PSR indicates his concession to the forfeiture action. In the absence of a\nshowing that the omission affected his substantial rights, Kellum has failed to\ndemonstrate plain error, and the judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">     Case: 10-50501     Document: 00511651458         Page: 1     Date Filed: 11/01/2011\n\n\n\n\n           IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                    FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT  United States Court of Appeals\n                                                    Fifth Circuit\n\n                                                                            FILED\n                                                                         November 1, 2011\n                                     No. 10-50501\n                                   Summary Calendar                        Lyle W.
