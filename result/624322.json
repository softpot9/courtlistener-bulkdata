Under California law,\n\n\u201ca person who unlawfully fights in a public place or challenges another person in a\n\npublic place to fight\u201d is guilty of a misdemeanor and is subject to either imprisonment,\n\na fine, or both.

A rational trier of fact\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          San Nicolas avers that his sufficiency of evidence claim, as opposed to the\ndenial of habeas relief, is subject to de novo review because the California Court of\nAppeal applied the wrong legal standard when it considered the admissibility of San\nNicolas\u2019 accomplices\u2019 testimony.

In California, a defendant is\n\nguilty of aiding and abetting a target crime if \u201cacting with (1) knowledge of the\n\nperpetrator\u2019s unlawful purpose, and (2) the intent or purpose of committing,\n\nencouraging, or facilitating the commission of a predicate or target offense, (3) by act\n\nor advice [the defendant] aided, promoted, encouraged or instigated the commission\n\nof the target crime.\u201d People v.

The record, however, shows that\n\nVarela called San Nicolas and informed him of his desire to fight the rival gang, that\n\nSan Nicolas responded to Varela\u2019s call for assistance immediately, and that he then\n\nactually did help Varela by driving him to the scene, picking up additional manpower,\n\nattempting to give Varela a gun, bringing a gun himself, and then facilitating the\n\ngetaway by driving away. A rational trier of fact could determine that, taken together,\n\nthese facts support a finding that San Nicolas aided and abetted in the challenge to\n\nfight.\n\n         San Nicolas further contends that evidence presented at trial was insufficient\n\nto demonstrate that the murder of a rival gang member was the \u201cnatural and probable\n\n\n                                            4\n\fconsequence\u201d of the challenge to fight. To convict San Nicolas of murder under this\n\ntheory, the jury was required to find, in addition to finding that the target crime, a\n\nchallenge to fight, occurred and that San Nicolas aided and abetted it, that (1)\n\nLawrence Alvarado (\u201cAlvarado\u201d), the man who shot the victim, was a \u201cco-principal\u201d\n\nin the challenge to fight, and (2) that the murder was objectively something a\n\nreasonably prudent person would have expected likely to occur. The evidence was\n\nsufficient for a rational trier of fact to make both of these additional findings. San\n\nNicolas picked up Alvarado after picking up Varela on his way over to rival gang\n\nterritory; from this fact alone it is reasonable to conclude that Alvarado was a co-\n\nprincipal to the target crime, the challenge to fight. Further, the record shows that San\n\nNicolas was armed, attempted to arm Varela, and was carrying angry gang members\n\nin his car to rival gang turf. A rational trier of fact could conclude that a murder was\n\namong the objectively foreseeable consequences of these acts by their very nature, and\n\nespecially so when considered in the context of gang warfare.2\n\n      Thus, the trial court\u2019s verdict survives the Jackson standard, and the California\n\nCourt of Appeal\u2019s decision survives AEDPA review.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         San Nicolas also argues that as a matter of California law, a murder cannot\nbe the \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of the misdemeanor of a challenge to fight.\nThat question is not properly before us, however, as on habeas review, this court need\nonly look to state law to list the elements of crimes, and determines sufficiency of\nevidence claims under federal standards.

Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n      On this point, San Nicolas claims the prosecutor violated his constitutional\n\nrights by characterizing San Nicolas and his co-defendant as \u201cinitial aggressors\u201d or\n\n\u201cmutual combatants\u201d and stated that they could not claim self-defense. Instead, San\n\nNicolas argues that they were merely \u201clooking for a fight\u201d\u2014distinct from initial\n\naggression, and they were actually the victims of an ambush by enemies using deadly\n\nforce; as such they were entitled to self-defense.\n\n      Prosecutorial misconduct warrants federal habeas relief only when the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s misleading or deceptive conduct or language \u201cso infected the trial with\n\nunfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d Darden v.\n\nWainwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111717\"><a href=\"/opinion/111717/darden-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181 (1986) (quoting Donnelly v.

None of what the prosecutor did or said during his closing\n\nargument was a misrepresentation of law constituting misconduct; he in fact read\n\naloud during his closing argument the correct standard jury instructions regarding self-\n\ndefense available to someone who initiates an assault and to a mutual combatant.\n\nMoreover, any of the ways in which he characterized the law to favor his case were\n\nneutralized by admonitions that the judge gave the jury, warning them that the\n\nattorneys would be shading the law to favor their cases, as well as the jury instructions\n\nthemselves, which were correct statements of law. Finally, the Court of Appeal cited\n\n\n                                           6\n\fto the correct federal standard for prosecutorial misconduct and proceeded with its\n\nanalysis accordingly. Thus, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s closing arguments did not constitute misconduct was neither contrary to,\n\nnor involved an unreasonable application of Darden, and thus survives AEDPA\n\nreview.3\n\n      The denial of habeas relief is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n         At argument, in response to questions from the panel, San Nicolas\u2019 counsel\nseemed to argue a third claim: that there is a fatal inconsistency between the jury\u2019s\ngeneral verdict and its findings regarding sentencing enhancements. We cannot\nconsider that argument here, however, because it was not included in the Certificate\nof Appealability, nor was it raised in San Nicolas\u2019 brief.

San\n\nNicolas picked up Alvarado after picking up Varela on his way over to rival gang\n\nterritory; from this fact alone it is reasonable to conclude that Alvarado was a co-\n\nprincipal to the target crime, the challenge to fight. Further, the record shows that San\n\nNicolas was armed, attempted to arm Varela, and was carrying angry gang members\n\nin his car to rival gang turf. A rational trier of fact could conclude that a murder was\n\namong the objectively foreseeable consequences of these acts by their very nature, and\n\nespecially so when considered in the context of gang warfare.2\n\n      Thus, the trial court\u2019s verdict survives the Jackson standard, and the California\n\nCourt of Appeal\u2019s decision survives AEDPA review.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         San Nicolas also argues that as a matter of California law, a murder cannot\nbe the \u201cnatural and probable consequence\u201d of the misdemeanor of a challenge to fight.\nThat question is not properly before us, however, as on habeas review, this court need\nonly look to state law to list the elements of crimes, and determines sufficiency of\nevidence claims under federal standards. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324 n. 16.\n\n                                           5\n\f                           II. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n      On this point, San Nicolas claims the prosecutor violated his constitutional\n\nrights by characterizing San Nicolas and his co-defendant as \u201cinitial aggressors\u201d or\n\n\u201cmutual combatants\u201d and stated that they could not claim self-defense. Instead, San\n\nNicolas argues that they were merely \u201clooking for a fight\u201d\u2014distinct from initial\n\naggression, and they were actually the victims of an ambush by enemies using deadly\n\nforce; as such they were entitled to self-defense.\n\n      Prosecutorial misconduct warrants federal habeas relief only when the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s misleading or deceptive conduct or language \u201cso infected the trial with\n\nunfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d Darden v.\n\nWainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986) (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S.\n\n637, 643 (1974)). None of what the prosecutor did or said during his closing\n\nargument was a misrepresentation of law constituting misconduct; he in fact read\n\naloud during his closing argument the correct standard jury instructions regarding self-\n\ndefense available to someone who initiates an assault and to a mutual combatant.\n\nMoreover, any of the ways in which he characterized the law to favor his case were\n\nneutralized by admonitions that the judge gave the jury, warning them that the\n\nattorneys would be shading the law to favor their cases, as well as the jury instructions\n\nthemselves, which were correct statements of law. Finally, the Court of Appeal cited\n\n\n                                           6\n\fto the correct federal standard for prosecutorial misconduct and proceeded with its\n\nanalysis accordingly. Thus, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s closing arguments did not constitute misconduct was neither contrary to,\n\nnor involved an unreasonable application of Darden, and thus survives AEDPA\n\nreview.3\n\n      The denial of habeas relief is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n         At argument, in response to questions from the panel, San Nicolas\u2019 counsel\nseemed to argue a third claim: that there is a fatal inconsistency between the jury\u2019s\ngeneral verdict and its findings regarding sentencing enhancements. We cannot\nconsider that argument here, however, because it was not included in the Certificate\nof Appealability, nor was it raised in San Nicolas\u2019 brief.
