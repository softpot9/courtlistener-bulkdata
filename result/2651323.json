The United States Court of Federal\nClaims dismissed the actions as time-barred. Because the\nCourt of Federal Claims violated this court\u2019s mandate in\nBanks v. United States (Banks II), 314 F.3d 1304, 1310\n(Fed. Cir. 2003), and clearly erred in finding that\nAppellants knew or should have known of their claims\nbefore 1952, the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 dismissal is\nreversed.\n                         BACKGROUND\n                I. The St. Joseph Harbor Jetties\n    Beginning in the 1830s, the Corps began constructing\ntwo major harbor jetties on Lake Michigan near the St.\nJoseph River. These jetties protrude outward from the\n\fBANKS   v. US                                              3\n\n\n\nmouth of the river into the body of the lake. They were\nperiodically extended until 1903, when they reached their\ncurrent length. After 1903, major construction on the\njetties ceased until 1950, when the Corps began a project\nto encase the jetties in steel-sheet piling. This project was\ncompleted in 1989.\n    Appellants (also referred to as \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) are\nlandowners along approximately four and one-half miles\nof the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, south of the jetties.\nThis shoreline is eroding naturally, but Appellants allege\nthe jetties block the flow of sand and sediment from the\nriver and the lakeshore north of their properties.\nSpecifically, they argue that the structures interrupt the\nnatural littoral drift within the lake, leading to increased\nerosion on their properties, amounting to an unlawful\ntaking under the Fifth Amendment.\n    The Corps has also been concerned with erosion along\nthe Lake Michigan shoreline. In 1958, the Corps released\na \u201cBeach Erosion Control Study\u201d (the \u201c1958 Study\u201d) that\nexamined the effects of beach erosion on Berrien County,\nMichigan, where the St. Joseph jetties are located. This\nReport documented increased erosion in certain areas as a\nresult of the jetties and recommended that a nourishment\nprogram \u201cbe initiated at the earliest practicable date.\u201d\nJ.A. 5939. This program did not target Appellants\u2019 land\nbecause the land was then private and ineligible for\nfederal funding. Nonetheless, the project was expected to\nbenefit them by \u201crestoration of normal littoral drift\u201d in the\narea. J.A. 5959.\n    In 1968, Congress enacted the \u201cRivers and Harbors\nAct,\u201d which authorized the Secretary of the Army to\n\u201cinvestigate, study, and construct projects for the\nprevention or mitigation of shore damages attributable to\nFederal navigation works.\u201d River and Harbor Act of 1968,\nPub. L. No. 90-483, \u00a7 111, 82 Stat. 731, 735 (1968)\n(codified as amended at 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 426i (2012)).\n\fBANKS   v. US                                              4\n\n\n\nPursuant to this authority, the Corps proposed a plan to\nmitigate the erosion caused by the jetties by dumping\nsand into feeder beaches located to the north of\nAppellants\u2019 properties. This endeavor was projected to\n\u201cprovide the quantities of littoral material interrupted by\nthe [jetties] to the shores downdrift.\u201d J.A. 5061.\n    Implemented in 1976, the mitigation plan \u201cinvolved\nplacing fine sand from the harbor maintenance dredging\non the downdrift [southerly] beaches.\u201d Banks v. United\nStates (Banks I), 49 Fed. Cl. 806, 818 (2001), rev\u2019d, 314\nF.3d 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).     After fifteen years of beach\nnourishment, the mitigation efforts shifted to using\ncoarser sediment, in the hope it would have a longer\nretention time than fine sand. Eventually, in 1995, the\nCorps dumped \u201cbarge-loads of large rocks into the lake.\u201d\nId. at 819.\n    In relation to these projects, the Corps released a\nseries of reports in 1973, 1996, 1997, and 1999 on the\nerosive effects of the jetties and the progress of mitigation\nefforts. There is also an April 20, 1998, newspaper article\nrelating to the erosion.\n    The 1973 Report \u201chas been described, without\ncontradiction, \u2018as the first credible look at the St. Joseph\nHarbor structures in estimating the total amount of\nmaterial trapped in the structures.\u2019\u201d Banks v. United\nStates, 78 Fed. Cl. 603, 612 (2007) (\u201cLiability Op.\u201d). The\nCorps started implementing mitigation programs after\nthis Report.\n    The 1996 Report concluded that the St. Joseph\nshoreline was \u201cin a state of recession\u201d and that the erosion\nthat occurs during lakebed downcutting 1 is \u201cpermanent.\u201d\n\n    1 Downcutting is explained as follows: \u201cIf the sand\ncover to glacial till is depleted, the energy of the waves\nand the shifting of the sand, which acts as \u2018sandpaper,\u2019\n\fBANKS   v. US                                               5\n\n\n\nLarry E. Pearson, Andrew Morang & Robert B. Nairn,\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Geologic Effects on\nBehavior of Beachfill and Shoreline Stability for\nSoutheast Lake Michigan 9, 48 (1996) (\u201c1996 Report\u201d).\nHowever, the Report also indicated uncertainty regarding\nthe effects of mitigation efforts: the mitigation program\n\u201cmay provide at least partial protection to the underlying\nglacial till along and offshore of the feeder beach and the\nwaterworks revetment section of shore. It is unclear\nwhether the beach nourishment is having any negative or\npositive impact along the 3.5-km revetment section of\nshoreline south of the waterworks.\u201d Id. at 49; see also\nBanks II, 314 F.3d at 1307.\n    The 1997 Report observed that some areas were\nbenefitting from nourishment but in other areas the\nresults were \u201cquestionable.\u201d       J.A. 5516.       The 1999\nReport\u2014made public in 2000\u2014identified Lake Michigan\nas a cohesive, rather than sandy, shoreline, and stated\nthat \u201c\u2018[e]rosion of the consolidated layer [underlayer of a\ncohesive coastline] is generally irreversible.\u2019\u201d 2 Banks I, 49\n\n\ncan cause the lake bottom to erode and thus lower in a\nprocess referred to as \u2018downcutting.\u2019\u201d Liability Op., 78\nFed. Cl. at 622.\n    2 \u201cThe composition of the lakebed is relevant because\n\nthe composition affects erosion and mitigation processes.\u201d\nLiability Op., 78 Fed. Cl. at 622. A sandy lakebed is made\nup of materials that are loosely deposited, or easily\ndispersed.     Id. at 621.       Thus, according to the\nGovernment\u2019s expert, \u201cas long as the sand supply south of\nthe harbor is restored to the pre-harbor levels, then we\ncan assume directly that the erosion will remain the same\nas pre-harbor levels, all other things aside.\u201d Id. (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Conversely, in a\ncohesive lakebed, the materials are bound together and\nare not \u201cfreely mobile.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).     Cohesive shores are thus \u201cmore\n\fBANKS   v. US                                             6\n\n\n\nFed. Cl. at 823 (quoting J.A. 5637). The 1999 Report also\nfound that the effects of the nourishment programs were\nlimited because the programs were based on the\nassumption that the coastline was sandy, with an\nunlimited sand supply, and not cohesive. Appellants\nrelied on the 1999 Report in arguing their claims were not\ntime-barred and stated that \u201cthe language in this [R]eport\nis the first clear indication of permanent damage caused\nby the harbor structures.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n                  II. Procedural History\n    This case began in 1999, when a majority of\nAppellants filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims\nagainst the Government claiming an unconstitutional\ntaking under the Fifth Amendment. 3 See 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1491 (1994). In 2001, the Government filed a Motion to\nDismiss the Complaint as being time-barred. There was\nalready a \u201cwell-developed\u201d evidentiary record before the\n\ncomplicated\u201d because the \u201csand acts to abrade, sort of like\nsandpaper, the till.\u201d Id. at 622 (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted). However, \u201c[t]here\u2019s no scientific\nknowledge as to . . . when you increase your erosion and\nwhen you may decrease your erosion.\u201d Id. In any event,\n\u201cwhat\u2019s critical about till downcutting is . . . [o]nce it\nerodes, it does not recover.\u201d Id. Stated simply, if a\nshoreline is sandy, mitigation will be more successful\nthan if the shoreline is cohesive.\n     3 The original July 9, 1999, Complaint was filed on\n\nbehalf of a \u201cproposed class\u201d of \u201capproximately 200\nlandowners who own the shoreline property in the area\nextending 53,000 feet south from the St. Joseph Harbor\njetties.\u201d J.A. 4939. The Court of Federal Claims denied\nclass certification, and the thirty-seven Plaintiffs in this\naction filed separate Complaints. Appellants\u2019 counsel\ntreats the allegations in the Complaints as the same. See\nBanks I, 49 Fed. Cl. at 808.\n\fBANKS   v.

Appellants also offered\nexpert testimony from Dr. Guy Meadows, a mechanical\nengineering professor at the University of Michigan.\nThe Court of Federal Claims granted the Motion and\ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding\nthat the claims had accrued in 1989 and were therefore\nbarred by the Tucker Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.\nId. Appellants appealed, and this court reversed and\nremanded in 2003, holding that Appellants\u2019 claims did not\nmaterialize until 2000, when the Corps\u2019 Reports\n\u201ccollectively indicated that the erosion was permanent\nand irreversible.\u201d      Banks II, 314 F.3d at 1310.\nSpecifically, this court held: \u201cWe are satisfied that the\n[P]laintiffs met their jurisdictional burden before the\nCourt of Federal Claims.\u201d Id.\n    On remand, the Court of Federal Claims held\nseparate trials on liability and damages. On June 4,\n2007, the case proceeded to the trial on liability. Liability\nOp., 78 Fed. Cl. 603. The primary issues addressed were:\n(1) the zone of influence of the jetties and whether\nAppellants\u2019 properties were located within that zone; (2)\nwhether the composition of the lakebed adjacent to the\nproperty was sandy or cohesive; and (3) the effectiveness\nof the beach nourishment mitigation program. Id. at 613\u2013\n14. The Court of Federal Claims concluded that, contrary\nto the allegations in Appellants\u2019 Complaints, the jetties\nwere impermeable to sand before they were encased in\nsteel. See id. at 636. The court also found that the\nUnited States was liable for 30% of erosion between 1950\nand 1970, after each owner\u2019s acquisition of his or her\nproperty. It held that, after 1970, the United States was\nresponsible for 30% of any losses to erosion that had not\nbeen effectively mitigated. Id. at 656. In so concluding,\nthe Court of Federal Claims \u201cheard testimony from 22\nwitnesses and received some 75 exhibits into evidence.\u201d\nId. at 608.\n\fBANKS   v. US                                             8\n\n\n\n    Following the Liability Opinion, Appellants made\nadditional motions, including a Motion in Limine based\non the law-of-the-case doctrine to preclude (1) all evidence\nthat the erosion suffered by Appellants was not\npermanent and irreversible; and (2) evidence relating to\nthe composition of the nearshore lakebed adjacent to\nAppellants\u2019 properties. J.A. 1859. The Court of Federal\nClaims denied the Motion as to both requests. Appellants\nalso moved to clarify the measure of damages. The court\ngranted the motion to clarify and modified its ruling,\nfinding \u201cthat property owners at the time of the taking\nare entitled to compensation for \u2018all damages, past,\npresent, and prospective.\u2019\u201d J.A. 1755 (internal citation\nomitted). The court then held a trial on damages from\nApril 18\u201321, 2011, and from April 25\u201328, 2011. Banks v.\nUnited States (Banks III), 102 Fed. Cl. 115, 120 (2011).\n     After the Court of Federal Claims conducted the\ndamages trial, it found there was \u201ca jurisdictional issue\nthat arose in connection with its drafting of the trial\nopinion.\u201d Banks v. United States, 99 Fed. Cl. 622, 623\n(2011) (opinion requesting additional briefing). The court\nthen directed the parties to file additional briefing\naddressing whether the Court of Federal Claims had\njurisdiction to hear Appellants\u2019 claims.      Id. at 626.\nSpecifically, the court asked the parties to brief the\nfollowing two questions:\n   1) Given the court\u2019s finding after the trial of\n   liability that the jetties were impermeable to sand\n   before they were encased in steel sheet piling, and\n   given the Corps\u2019 acknowledgement of the\n   erosional impact of \u201charbor structures\u201d in the\n   1958 Study, on what date did [P]laintiffs\u2019 claims\n   accrue? Does the court possess subject matter\n   jurisdiction to hear [P]laintiffs\u2019 claims?\n   2) Does the Federal Circuit\u2019s determination that\n   [P]laintiffs\u2019 claims accrued with the publication of\n   three Corps [R]eports on mitigation constitute the\n\fBANKS     v. US                                               9\n\n\n\n      \u201claw of the case\u201d which may not be disturbed by\n      the court notwithstanding inconsistent factual\n      findings of the court after trial?\nId.\n    Following the supplemental briefing, on December 22,\n2011, the Court of Federal Claims again found it lacked\njurisdiction. The court additionally presented findings \u201cin\nthe alternative\u201d on the merits of the case, stating if \u201cany\nappeal should disagree with the court\u2019s view of its\njurisdiction, and to avoid the possibility . . . of a repetitive\ntrial, the court also presents here its findings from the\ntrial.\u201d Banks III, 102 Fed. Cl. at 120. 4\n    Appellants timely appealed.          This court has\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3) (2012).\n                         DISCUSSION\n    The principal issues on appeal are (1) whether this\ncourt\u2019s opinion in Banks II precluded the Court of Federal\nClaims from reconsidering when Appellants\u2019 claims\naccrued for the purposes of subject matter jurisdiction,\nand (2) whether Appellants knew or should have known\nthat their claims accrued by 1952.\n\n\n\n      Specifically, the Court of Federal Claims held:\n      4\n\n   Since 1970, the Corps\u2019 mitigation efforts have\n   prevented the jetties from causing erosion to\n   [P]laintiffs\u2019 properties, with one exception.\n   Further, [P]laintiffs have failed to prove, with\n   regard to any of [P]laintiffs\u2019 properties\u2014whether\n   by comparing the cost of shore protection to the\n   dollar amount of their reasonably foreseeable\n   damages or by some other means\u2014that the\n   installation of shore protection would be sound\n   economy.\nBanks III, 102 Fed. Cl. 115.\n\fBANKS   v. US                                           10\n\n\n\n                    I. Standard of Review\n    This court reviews legal holdings de novo and\nexamines factual findings for clear error. Bell BCI Co. v.\nUnited States, 570 F.3d 1337, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2009).\n\u201c[T]he interpretation by an appellate court of its own\nmandate is properly considered a question of law,\nreviewable de novo.\u201d Laitram Corp. v. NEC Corp., 115\nF.3d 947, 950 (Fed. Cir. 1997). A dismissal for lack of\njurisdiction by the court below is also a legal conclusion\nreviewed de novo. Tex. Peanut Farmers v. United States,\n409 F.3d 1370, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2005).\n                II. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n    The Tucker Act allows plaintiffs to sue the United\nStates for claims founded upon the Constitution, Acts of\nCongress, agency regulations, contracts with the United\nStates, \u201cor for liquidated or unliquidated damages in\ncases not sounding in tort.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491. Title 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2501 limits this allowance to a period of six\nyears. The six-year limitation operates as a suspension of\nsovereign      immunity,     because    without    explicit\nCongressional authorization, the United States may not\nbe sued. United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 212\n(1983) (\u201cIt is axiomatic that the United States may not be\nsued without its consent and that the existence of consent\nis a prerequisite for jurisdiction.\u201d); United States v.\nSherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 586 (1941). Thus, the statute\u2019s\nsix-year time frame is a limited jurisdictional window in\nwhich plaintiffs have the ability to bring a claim against\nthe Government. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1491, 2501.\n                    III. The Mandate Rule\n    The law-of-the-case doctrine \u201cposits that when a court\ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue\nto govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the\nsame case.\u201d Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp.,\n486 U.S. 800, 815\u2013816 (1988) (internal quotation marks\n\fBANKS   v. US                                              11\n\n\n\nand citation omitted). The rule encourages both finality\nand efficiency in the judicial process by preventing\nrelitigation of already-settled issues. Id. at 816. The\nmandate rule, encompassed by the broader law-of-the-\ncase doctrine, dictates that \u201can inferior court has no\npower or authority to deviate from the mandate issued by\nan appellate court.\u201d Briggs v. Pa. R. Co., 334 U.S. 304,\n306 (1948); see also Cent. Soya Co. v. Geo. A. Hormel &\nCo., 723 F.2d 1573, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (explaining that\nthe law-of-the-case doctrine was \u201cjudicially created to\nensure judicial efficiency and to prevent the possibility of\nendless litigation\u201d). Once a question has been considered\nand decided by an appellate court, the issue may not be\nreconsidered at any subsequent stage of the litigation,\nsave on appeal. Cf. In re Sanford Fork & Tool Co., 160\nU.S. 247, 255 (1895) (\u201cWhatever was before [the Supreme\nCourt], and disposed of by its decree, is considered as\nfinally settled. . . . If the circuit court mistakes or\nmisconstrues the decree of this court, and does not give\nfull effect to the mandate, its action may be controlled . . .\nupon a new appeal.\u201d).\n    Under the mandate rule, a court below must adhere to\na matter decided in a prior appeal unless one of three\n\u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist: (1) subsequent evidence\npresented at trial was substantially different from the\noriginal evidence; (2) controlling authority has since made\na contrary and applicable decision of the law; or (3) the\ndecision was clearly erroneous \u201cand would work a\nmanifest injustice.\u201d Gindes v. United States, 740 F.2d\n947, 950 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). This rule is limited to issues \u201cactually\ndecided, either explicitly or by necessary implication\u201d in\nthe previous litigation. Toro Co. v. White Consol. Indus.,\nInc., 383 F.3d 1326, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2004).\n    Appellants\u2019 first jurisdictional argument is that the\nCourt of Federal Claims violated this court\u2019s mandate and\nthat none of the three exceptions gave it the power to do\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            12\n\n\n\nso. The Government counters that the Court of Federal\nClaims \u201ccorrectly concluded that the issue here\u2014whether\nBanks knew or should have known of the claims before\nthe refurbishment and mitigation projects were\nundertaken in the 1950s and 1970s\u2014was not considered\nor decided by this Court in Banks II.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 30.\n    To determine whether this court\u2019s mandate in\nBanks II was violated, its scope must first be established.\nThe Banks II court prefaced the analysis by stating its\nfocus: \u201cThe issue before this court on appeal is whether\nthe Court of Federal Claims erred in finding that the\n[P]laintiffs\u2019 claims fell outside the applicable statute of\nlimitations.\u201d Banks II, 314 F.3d at 1308. After applying\nthe analogous case of Applegate v. United States, 25 F.3d\n1579 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the court held that:\n   We are satisfied that the [P]laintiffs met their\n   jurisdictional burden before the Court of Federal\n   Claims on the basis of the justifiable uncertainty\n   of the permanence of the taking caused by the\n   actual mitigation efforts of the Corps. The statute\n   of limitations did not begin to run until the Corps\n   issued the 1996, 1997, and 1999 Reports. Because\n   each [R]eport was issued less than six years\n   before [P]laintiffs filed their [C]omplaints, each\n   [C]omplaint was timely.\nBanks II, 314 F.3d at 1310 (citation omitted).\n    On remand, the Court of Federal Claims again\ndismissed the case, finding Appellants\u2019 Complaints were\nuntimely. It held its dismissal was not barred by the\nmandate rule, on the ground that this court\u2019s decision did\nnot address \u201cwhether [P]laintiffs\u2019 claims accrued before\nthe [G]overnment made its first promises of mitigation.\u201d\nBanks III, 102 Fed. Cl. at 150. Finding that \u201cthe jetties\nwere impermeable to sand before they were encased in\nsteel sheet piling,\u201d id. at 131, the Court of Federal Claims\nheld the Appellants\u2019 claims accrued before 1952 and\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            13\n\n\n\ndismissed the case for want of jurisdiction. The Court of\nFederal Claims found that for Appellants\u2019 claims to have\nbeen timely filed, the erosion must have stabilized after\n1952, six years before the 1958 Study, which Appellants\nargued created justifiable uncertainty about the\npermanence of the taking. Id. at 133\u201334.\n    The Government argues that Banks II never decided\nwhether the claims accrued before 1952, because both this\ncourt and the Court of Federal Claims \u201caccepted as true\nthe allegations of the Complaints, including the allegation\nthat the jetties caused no damage before 1950.\u201d\nAppellee\u2019s Br. 31\u201332. The Government therefore contends\nthat the Court of Federal Claims did not violate the\nmandate rule when it considered that issue on remand.\n    The problem with the Government\u2019s position is that\nneither the Court of Federal Claims nor this court\naccepted as true all the allegations in Appellants\u2019\nComplaint. When reviewing a motion to dismiss for lack\nof subject matter jurisdiction, a court accepts only\nuncontroverted factual allegations as true for purposes of\nthe motion. Gibbs v. Buck, 307 U.S. 66, 72 (1939). \u201cIf a\nmotion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\nhowever, challenges the truth of the jurisdictional facts\nalleged in the complaint, the district court may consider\nrelevant evidence in order to resolve the factual dispute.\u201d\nReynolds v. Army & Air Force Exch. Serv., 846 F.2d 746,\n747 (Fed. Cir. 1988); see also Engage Learning v. Salazar,\n660 F.3d 1346, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Cedars-Sinai Med.\nCtr. v. Watkins, 11 F.3d 1573, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In\nsuch cases, the plaintiff has the burden of proving subject\nmatter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\nReynolds, 846 F.2d at 748 (citing Zunamon v. Brown, 418\nF.2d 883, 886 (8th Cir. 1969)). Additionally, \u201c[i]f the Rule\n12(b)(1) motion [to dismiss] denies or controverts the\npleader\u2019s allegations of jurisdiction . . . the movant is\ndeemed to be challenging the factual basis for the court\u2019s\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            14\n\n\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Cedars-Sinai Med. Ctr., 11\nF.3d at 1583.\n    In Banks I, the Court of Federal Claims stated that\n\u201c[b]ecause the parties were preparing for trial at the time\n[D]efendant filed its [M]otion to [D]ismiss, the evidentiary\nrecord is well-developed. The court has before it the\nanticipated trial exhibits prepared by the parties and filed\nin accordance with the pre-trial scheduling order.\u201d Banks\nI, 49 Fed. Cl. at 809 n.4. The court then explained that\n\u201cPlaintiffs cannot rely merely on the allegations in the\n[C]omplaint. Because [P]laintiffs bear the burden of proof\nby a preponderance of the evidence, they must offer\nrelevant, competent evidence to show that they filed suit\nwithin six years of the accrual of their claims.\u201d Id. at 809\n(internal citation omitted). Explicitly looking outside of\nthe Complaint, the court granted the Government\u2019s\nMotion to Dismiss, stating: \u201cThe court observes that\n[P]laintiffs\u2019 claims that they were uncertain about the\npermanence of the erosion damage until 1999 are\ncontradicted by their own evidence.\u201d 5 Id. at 824.\n    Holding those findings were clearly erroneous and\nthat Appellants\u2019 claims did not accrue until 2000, the\nBanks II court relied on the technical Reports, not solely\non the Appellants\u2019 allegations in the Complaint. It is\nsimply inaccurate to claim that the factual allegations of\nthe Complaint were taken as true by either court.\n    Banks II did not \u201cleave open\u201d the issue of when\nPlaintiffs\u2019 claims accrued. The Banks II court held the\nComplaints were not barred by the six-year statute of\n\n\n\n   5   The Banks II court stated that the 1996, 1997, and\n1999 Reports were all in evidence before the Court of\nFederal Claims. Banks II, 314 F.3d at 1307 (explaining\n\u201c[t]he evidence before the Court of Federal Claims\nincluded three technical [R]eports issued by the Corps\u201d).\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            15\n\n\n\nlimitations. Necessary and predicate to the holding was a\nfinding that the mitigation efforts delayed claim accrual.\n    Because the Banks II mandate decided the accrual\ndate, the Court of Federal Claims was permitted to revisit\nthis issue only if one of the three exceptions to the\nmandate rule applied. The Court of Federal Claims did\nnot find, and the Government did not argue, that the\nBanks II decision was clearly erroneous or that there was\na change in controlling precedent. Thus, only the third\nexception\u2014whether subsequent evidence presented at\ntrial was substantially different from the original\nevidence\u2014is relevant.\n    The Government contends that the \u201cmost persuasive\nevidence that the jetties had caused erosion of the Banks\nproperties\u201d was the 1958 Study, which was admitted in\nJuly 2007, six years and four years after Banks I and\nBanks II, respectively. Appellee\u2019s Br. 34 (citing Banks III,\n102 Fed. Cl. at 134). Appellants respond that \u201cthe\nevidence is not new, and far from being substantially\ndifferent, is merely cumulative of the jurisdictional\nevidence that was before this [c]ourt.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 27.\n     When a party offers additional evidence that is\nconsistent with previously-offered evidence, but is not\nnew or different in any real sense, a court should decline\nthe invitation to revisit its previous determination. See\nIntergraph Corp. v. Intel Corp., 253 F.3d 695, 698 (Fed.\nCir. 2001) (noting that the district court stated,\n\u201c[a]lthough Intergraph may have obtained more evidence\nrelated to the FTC\u2019s actions, the Federal Circuit was\ncertainly aware of the actions\u201d); see also United States v.\nBartsh, 69 F.3d 864, 867 (8th Cir. 1995) (finding that the\nAppellant presented \u201cno new substantive evidence, but\nmerely a recalculation of the same evidence that was\noffered at the sentencing hearing\u201d). In the instant case,\nwhile the Court of Federal Claims may have examined\nthe evidence more thoroughly in the bifurcated liability\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            16\n\n\n\nand damages trial, all of it was consistent with evidence\nthat was before both the Court of Federal Claims on the\nGovernment\u2019s Motion to Dismiss and this court on appeal\nin 2003.\n    The evidence before the Court of Federal Claims after\nthis court\u2019s mandate issued was not \u201cnew\u201d but merely\ncumulative of evidence before it in 2001. The evidentiary\nrecord before the Court of Federal Claims in 2001\nincluded the 1996, 6 1997, 7 and 1999 8 Reports, a 1998\nnewspaper article, 9 and evidence from Plaintiffs\u2019 expert,\n\n\n\n   6    The 1996 Report, in relevant part, states that the\nshoreline is in recession and that \u201c[e]vidence has been\npresented by Buckler (1981) showing a southward\nprogression of increased erosion rates since at least 1829.\nFurther studies by Buckler and Winters (1983) revealed\naverage bluff recession rates for the area between St.\nJoseph and Shoreham of approximately 0.6 m/year\nbetween 1829 and 1977.\u201d J.A. 5031 (emphases added).\n     7 The 1997 Report makes similar findings: \u201cThe\n\nharbor jetties were constructed originally in 1903 and\nhave been estimated to trap approximately 84,000 [cubic\nmeters] of sediment per year.\u201d J.A. 5434.\n     8 The 1999 Report similarly states \u201cthe removal of\n\nsand from the littoral transport system has been\noccurring from the time of construction; in some cases for\nover one hundred years.\u201d J.A. 5637 (emphasis added).\n     9 In the record, and cited by the Court of Federal\n\nClaims in 2001, was also a 1998 newspaper article from\nthe Herald-Palladium, titled \u201cToo soon to tell if erosion\nexperiment will help.\u201d The article, quoting a physical\nscientist for the Corps, Charles Thompson, stated: \u201cthe\nproject began only in the early 1970\u2019s so basically we have\n80, 90, or 100 years of non-mitigation to make up for. . . .\nFor most of the life of the St. Joseph\u2019s Harbor structures\n[jetties], little was done to mitigate the effects of those\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            17\n\n\n\nDr. Meadows, 10 all of which contained information similar\nto that in the 1958 Study.\n    The sum of that evidence is that erosion has been\noccurring since at least 1903. The evidence was not only\nbefore the Court of Federal Claims in Banks I; the court\nreferred to, and relied upon, it extensively. The same\nevidence was before this court in 2003, as evidenced by\nthe fact that the basis for this court\u2019s opinion in Banks II\nwas the 1996, 1997, and 1999 Reports. This court is not\npersuaded that any \u201cnew\u201d evidence required reexamining\njurisdiction that had already been decided by this court.\n    In evaluating the scope of the mandate, the actions of\nthe Court of Federal Claims must not be inconsistent with\nthe letter or spirit of the mandate. Engel Indus. Inc. v.\nLockformer Co., 166 F.3d 1379, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 1999).\nIndeed, \u201call issues within the scope of the appealed\njudgment are deemed incorporated within the mandate\nand thus are precluded from further adjudication.\u201d Id. at\n1383. The broad mandate issued by this court found that\nAppellants\u2019 claims did not accrue until the 1996, 1997,\nand 1999 Reports. This decision necessarily decided that\n\nstructures.\u201d    Banks I, 49 Fed. Cl. at 821 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n    10 The Court of Federal Claims also cited to testimony\n\nfrom Dr. Meadows that the jetties had been causing\nerosion since their completion in 1903. Specifically, Dr.\nMeadows testified that:\n    The harm that has been done is the accumulated\n    harm since 1903 [(the construction date of the\n    harbor jetties)]. That structure has done two\n    things. It has blocked the shore parallel transport\n    of material from north to south and it has also\n    deflected some of that material offshore and,\n    hence, being lost forever once it\u2019s beyond the\n    depth of closure.\nBanks I, 49 Fed.

The Court of\nFederal Claims\u2019 Banks III holding that the claims accrued\nbefore that time is therefore reversed.\n                 IV. Accrual Suspension\n    The Court of Federal Claims further erred in its\nanalysis of accrual suspension. The accrual of a claim\nagainst the United States is suspended, for purposes of 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2501, until the claimant knew or should have\nknown that the claim existed (\u201cthe accrual suspension\nrule\u201d). Boling v. United States, 220 F.3d 1365, 1373 (Fed.\nCir. 2000) (finding that, when determining when a taking\nclaim accrues, \u201cthe key issue is whether the permanent\nnature of the taking was evident such that the landowner\nshould have known that the land had suffered erosion\ndamage\u201d); Hopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United\nStates, 855 F.2d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1988); Kinsey v.\nUnited States, 852 F.2d 556, 557 n.* (Fed. Cir. 1988) (\u201cA\nclaim does not accrue unless the claimant knew or should\nhave known that the claim existed.\u201d); see also Holmes v.\nUnited States, 657 F.3d 1303, 1322 n.15 (Fed. Cir. 2011).\nFor the accrual suspension rule to apply, the claimant\n\u201cmust either show that the defendant has concealed its\nacts with the result that plaintiff was unaware of their\nexistence or it must show that its injury was \u2018inherently\nunknowable\u2019 at the accrual date.\u201d Young v. United States,\n529 F.3d 1380, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting Martinez v.\nUnited States, 333 F.3d 1295, 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (en\nbanc)).

US                                            19\n\n\n\n    The Court of Federal Claims found that Appellants\u2019\nargument relating to accrual suspension based on the\noverruling of adverse precedent was waived because they\ndid not raise it in their opening brief to that court. In the\nalternative, the court held that the accrual suspension\nrule was \u201cinapplicable to [P]laintiffs\u2019 claims.\u201d Banks III,\n102 Fed. Cl. at 144. On appeal, Appellants argue that\naccrual suspension should apply because they \u201cshould not\nreasonably have been expected to know that jetty-caused\nerosion was significantly damaging their properties until\n1997.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. 23. The Government contends\nthat Appellants \u201cnow raise[ ] a second accrual suspension\nargument that was not raised in the [Court of Federal\nClaims]\u201d and that argument is waived. Appellee\u2019s Br. 40.\n    Appellants have not waived their accrual suspension\narguments.       The Court of Federal Claims cited\nAppellants\u2019 argument \u201cthat as late as 1997 it was not\nunderstood that the harbor jetties caused increased\nerosion in [P]laintiffs\u2019 zone.       The implication of\n[P]laintiffs\u2019 argument is that their claims stabilized no\nearlier than 1997 because it was not understood at that\ntime that the jetties were causing erosion in [P]laintiffs\u2019\nzone.\u201d Banks III, 102 Fed. Cl. at 141. Though Banks did\nnot use the term \u201caccrual suspension\u201d in making this\nargument, the substance is the same as that which it\nargues before this court. Accordingly, the argument is not\nwaived.\n    The Court of Federal Claims held that \u201cerosion caused\nby the jetties in [P]laintiffs\u2019 zone was a longstanding\nproblem by 1952, beginning as early as 1903,\u201d id. at 138,\nand that the forty-nine-year passage of time and \u201cwell-\ndocumented\u201d erosion would have made it \u201cclear to a\nreasonable landowner . . . that the [G]overnment had\neffected a permanent taking,\u201d 11 id. at 140. Appellants\n\n    11The Court of Federal Claims found that \u201c[d]uring\nthe forty-nine years between 1903, when the jetties\n\fBANKS   v. US                                           20\n\n\n\nargue that they could not have known they had a takings\nclaim until 1997, when the 1997 Report issued. The\nGovernment counters that Appellants\u2019 claims were not\n\u201cinherently unknowable\u201d and that they should have\nknown about the erosion as early as 1950.\n    When there is a gradual physical process, such as\nerosion or flooding, the \u201cstabilization doctrine\u201d delays\nclaim accrual until the situation has \u201cstabilized.\u201d See\nUnited States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745, 749 (1947).\nThus, the statute of limitations under the Tucker Act only\nbegins to run when it \u201cbecomes clear that the gradual\nprocess set into motion by the [G]overnment has effected\na permanent taking, not when the process has ceased or\nwhen the entire extent of the damage is determined.\u201d\nBoling, 220 F.3d at 1370\u201371.\n    In making the determination of permanence, a court\nconsiders \u201cthe uncertainties of the terrain, the difficulty\nin determining the location of the government\u2019s easement,\nand the irregular process of erosion.\u201d Id. at 1373. Claims\nare deemed to accrue once the damage has \u201csubstantially\nencroached the parcels at issue and the damages were\nreasonably foreseeable.\u201d Id.\n    The Government argues that even if Appellants\ninferred from the various Corps Reports that the jetties\nhad not caused the specific damage to their properties,\n\u201c[they] w[ere] on notice of the well-documented connection\nbetween the jetties and erosion along the shore.\u201d\nAppellee\u2019s Br. 46. Likewise, the Court of Federal Claims\nimplies that Appellants knew or should have known that\nthe jetties were causing erosion because of the \u201cgeneral\n\n\n\nreached their final length, and 1952, the jetties were\nresponsible for 25% of the material eroded from Dr.\nNairn\u2019s study area, the ten mile segment of shoreline\nsouth of the jetties.\u201d Banks III, 102 Fed. Cl. at 140.\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            21\n\n\n\npattern of erosion that followed the lengthening of the\njetties in 1903.\u201d Banks III, 102 Fed. Cl. at 140.\n     Two factors complicate determining when Appellants\nknew or should have known of their alleged takings\nclaims. First, the shorelines of Appellants\u2019 properties are\nsubject to natural erosion and other natural fluctuations.\nAs this court found in Banks II, \u201cwithout human\nintervention, [erosion] occurs naturally at a rate of\napproximately one foot per year.\u201d 314 F.3d at 1306.\nFurthermore, Lake Michigan is subject to \u201c[s]hort period\nfluctuations up to about 1.8 feet, caused by winds and\ndifferences in barometric pressures, [which] occur with\nannual frequency.\u201d J.A. 5939. Waves and storms also\naffect the shorelines: \u201cWaves from both the northwest and\nsouthwest quadrants cause movement of beach material,\nbut as evidenced by the much greater accumulation of\nbeach material north of the St. Joseph Harbor structures,\nthe predominant direction of littoral transport is\nsouthward.\u201d Id. The Government\u2019s own expert, Dr.\nRobert Nairn, a coastal engineer, testified that the slow\nprocess of erosion is \u201cmasked by far larger swings in the\nwidth of the beaches next to [P]laintiffs\u2019 properties caused\nby cross-shore sand transport, a cyclical process by which\nsand is moved offshore during times of high lake levels\nand returned to the shore during times of low lake levels.\u201d\nBanks III, 102 Fed. Cl. at 121.\n    That the Plaintiffs were aware of some erosion is not\nsufficient for the claim to accrue. See Nw. La. Fish &\nGame Pres. Comm\u2019n v. United States, 446 F.3d 1285, 1291\n(Fed. Cir. 2006) (explaining because some growth of\nhydrilla is normal, the damage to Plaintiffs was not\nknown until there was uncontrolled overgrowth and the\nCorps issued a final refusal to lower the water level).\nIndeed, the Corps itself stated that only 30% of the\ndamage to Appellants\u2019 shorelines was attributable to the\nCorps\u2019 activity, meaning 70% of the damage to the subject\nproperties was attributable to naturally occurring erosion.\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            22\n\n\n\nJ.A. 5770. Accordingly, it is unreasonable to assume that\na property owner should have been able to discern the\ndifference between the naturally occurring erosion and\nthat caused by the jetties.\n     As found by this court in Banks II, Appellants could\nnot reasonably have known the damage was \u201cpermanent\u201d\nuntil the Corps issued its 1996, 1997, and 1999 Reports\nshowing that its mitigation efforts could not reverse the\ndamage caused by its jetties. Banks II, 314 F.3d at 1310.\nIt is erroneous to hold Plaintiffs responsible for knowledge\nthat the Government itself had disclaimed prior to the\n1997 Report. Cf. L.L.S. Leasing Corp. v. United States,\n695 F.2d 1359, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (by taking upon itself\nthe obligation to report overtime usage, the Government\nrelieved the lessor of monitoring such use).             The\nGovernment itself explained in the 1958 Study that the\nCorps believed that the erosion was not permanent and\ncould be mitigated and reversed. Banks III, 102 Fed. Cl.\nat 133. Moreover, in 1973, the Government believed that\nthe jetty-induced erosion had not reached the majority of\nAppellants\u2019 properties. 12 The Government\u2019s mitigation\nefforts thus delayed when Appellants knew or should\nhave known they had a claim.\n    Without a basis for imputing knowledge of the effect\nof the jetty-caused erosion on Appellants\u2019 properties, it\nwas unreasonable to find that the Appellants were aware\nof their claim regarding the permanency of the taking\nbefore the 1990s Reports.\n    In light of the foregoing, and because \u201cDickinson\ndiscouraged a strict application of accrual principles in\nunique cases involving Fifth Amendment takings by\ncontinuous physical processes,\u201d Applegate, 25 F.3d at\n\n\n   12  The 1973 Report found that the \u201carea of adverse\ninfluence\u201d of the jetties included properties less than\n21,000 feet south of the harbor. J.A. 5776.\n\fBANKS   v. US                                              23\n\n\n\n1582 (citing Dickinson, 331 U.S. at 749), the Court of\nFederal Claims\u2019 finding that Appellants knew or should\nhave known of the damage prior to 1952 is clearly\nerroneous.\n   V. The Alternative Merits Discussion is Not a Final,\n                  Appealable Decision\n   In Banks III, the Court of Federal Claims stated:\n   For purposes of judicial efficiency, if the reviewing\n   court in any appeal should disagree with the\n   court\u2019s view of its jurisdiction, and to avoid the\n   possibility of a trial opinion being drafted months\n   or years after the trial, and the possibility of a\n   repetitive trial, the court also presents here its\n   findings from the trial.        These findings are\n   presented in the alternative and, in the absence of\n   jurisdiction, do not entitle [P]laintiffs to just\n   compensation in the amounts determined by the\n   court.\n102 Fed. Cl. at 120.        In the absence of anything\nappealable, this court lacks appellate jurisdiction. See 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3). To be final and appealable, see Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 54, a decision must end the litigation on the\nmerits, Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945),\nand the judge must \u201cclearly declare[] h[er] intention in\nthis respect,\u201d United States v. F. & M. Schaefer Brewing\nCo., 356 U.S. 227, 232 (1958). Here, contrarily, the Court\nof Federal Claims reasoned that, \u201c[b]ecause [the]\nreferences [to when certain shore protection measures\nwere undertaken] are scattered across several thousand\npages of trial testimony and documentary evidence,\u201d it\nwould not decide \u201cwhich of [P]laintiffs\u2019 shore protection\nexpenses were incurred between 1950 and 1970, the\nperiod of time during which the government was\nresponsible for 30% of the erosion\u201d \u201cin the absence of\nbriefing or a stipulation by the parties.\u201d Banks III, 102\nFed. Cl. at 212. It declined to \u201cundertake to determine\n\fBANKS   v. US                                           24\n\n\n\nwhich of [P]laintiffs\u2019 expenses were incurred after 1970,\nthe period of time during which the [G]overnment has\ncompletely mitigated the erosion caused by the jetties.\u201d\nId. The Court of Federal Claims added that \u201c[i]f the\nreviewing court does not agree with the court\u2019s\ndetermination that it lacks jurisdiction to address\n[P]laintiffs\u2019 claims,\u201d it would direct the parties to file\neither a stipulation or briefing \u201cto enable the court to\ndetermine which of [P]laintiffs\u2019 shore protection expenses\nwere incurred prior to 1970 and which were incurred\nsubsequent to 1970.\u201d Id.\n    The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 alternative merits\ndiscussion is not a final and appealable decision over\nwhich this court has jurisdiction. On remand, the Court\nof Federal Claims may reconsider any merits rulings that\nwere rendered at a time it mistakenly believed it lacked\njurisdiction. In light of the Court of Federal Claims\u2019\nclearly erroneous fact finding on claim accrual, it is\nappropriate that there be no law-of-the-case or\ncomparable obstacle preventing it from reconsidering its\nearlier, related findings on the merits. This court\u2019s prior\nmandate\u2014that the claims did not accrue until the 1999\nReport\u2014is still law-of-the-case, binding below.\n                       CONCLUSION\n    The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 dismissal for lack of\njurisdiction is reversed and the case is remanded to the\nCourt of Federal Claims for further proceedings.\n                REVERSED AND REMANDED\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">  United States Court of Appeals\n      for the Federal Circuit\n                 ______________________\n\n              JOHN H.

The St. Joseph Harbor Jetties\n    Beginning in the 1830s, the Corps began constructing\ntwo major harbor jetties on Lake Michigan near the St.\nJoseph River. These jetties protrude outward from the\n\fBANKS   v. US                                              3\n\n\n\nmouth of the river into the body of the lake. They were\nperiodically extended until 1903, when they reached their\ncurrent length. After 1903, major construction on the\njetties ceased until 1950, when the Corps began a project\nto encase the jetties in steel-sheet piling. This project was\ncompleted in 1989.\n    Appellants (also referred to as \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) are\nlandowners along approximately four and one-half miles\nof the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, south of the jetties.\nThis shoreline is eroding naturally, but Appellants allege\nthe jetties block the flow of sand and sediment from the\nriver and the lakeshore north of their properties.\nSpecifically, they argue that the structures interrupt the\nnatural littoral drift within the lake, leading to increased\nerosion on their properties, amounting to an unlawful\ntaking under the Fifth Amendment.\n    The Corps has also been concerned with erosion along\nthe Lake Michigan shoreline. In 1958, the Corps released\na \u201cBeach Erosion Control Study\u201d (the \u201c1958 Study\u201d) that\nexamined the effects of beach erosion on Berrien County,\nMichigan, where the St. Joseph jetties are located. This\nReport documented increased erosion in certain areas as a\nresult of the jetties and recommended that a nourishment\nprogram \u201cbe initiated at the earliest practicable date.\u201d\nJ.A. 5939. This program did not target Appellants\u2019 land\nbecause the land was then private and ineligible for\nfederal funding. Nonetheless, the project was expected to\nbenefit them by \u201crestoration of normal littoral drift\u201d in the\narea. J.A. 5959.\n    In 1968, Congress enacted the \u201cRivers and Harbors\nAct,\u201d which authorized the Secretary of the Army to\n\u201cinvestigate, study, and construct projects for the\nprevention or mitigation of shore damages attributable to\nFederal navigation works.\u201d River and Harbor Act of 1968,\nPub.

After fifteen years of beach\nnourishment, the mitigation efforts shifted to using\ncoarser sediment, in the hope it would have a longer\nretention time than fine sand. Eventually, in 1995, the\nCorps dumped \u201cbarge-loads of large rocks into the lake.\u201d\nId. at 819.\n    In relation to these projects, the Corps released a\nseries of reports in 1973, 1996, 1997, and 1999 on the\nerosive effects of the jetties and the progress of mitigation\nefforts.

The 1999\nReport\u2014made public in 2000\u2014identified Lake Michigan\nas a cohesive, rather than sandy, shoreline, and stated\nthat \u201c\u2018[e]rosion of the consolidated layer [underlayer of a\ncohesive coastline] is generally irreversible.\u2019\u201d 2 Banks I, 49\n\n\ncan cause the lake bottom to erode and thus lower in a\nprocess referred to as \u2018downcutting.\u2019\u201d Liability Op., 78\nFed.

Procedural History\n    This case began in 1999, when a majority of\nAppellants filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims\nagainst the Government claiming an unconstitutional\ntaking under the Fifth Amendment. 3 See 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1491 (1994). In 2001, the Government filed a Motion to\nDismiss the Complaint as being time-barred. There was\nalready a \u201cwell-developed\u201d evidentiary record before the\n\ncomplicated\u201d because the \u201csand acts to abrade, sort of like\nsandpaper, the till.\u201d Id. at 622 (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).

Stated simply, if a\nshoreline is sandy, mitigation will be more successful\nthan if the shoreline is cohesive.\n     3 The original July 9, 1999, Complaint was filed on\n\nbehalf of a \u201cproposed class\u201d of \u201capproximately 200\nlandowners who own the shoreline property in the area\nextending 53,000 feet south from the St. Joseph Harbor\njetties.\u201d J.A. 4939. The Court of Federal Claims denied\nclass certification, and the thirty-seven Plaintiffs in this\naction filed separate Complaints. Appellants\u2019 counsel\ntreats the allegations in the Complaints as the same. See\nBanks I, 49 Fed. Cl. at 808.\n\fBANKS   v.

Appellants also offered\nexpert testimony from Dr. Guy Meadows, a mechanical\nengineering professor at the University of Michigan.\nThe Court of Federal Claims granted the Motion and\ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding\nthat the claims had accrued in 1989 and were therefore\nbarred by the Tucker Act\u2019s six-year statute of limitations.\nId. Appellants appealed, and this court reversed and\nremanded in 2003, holding that Appellants\u2019 claims did not\nmaterialize until 2000, when the Corps\u2019 Reports\n\u201ccollectively indicated that the erosion was permanent\nand irreversible.\u201d      Banks II, 314 F.3d at 1310.\nSpecifically, this court held: \u201cWe are satisfied that the\n[P]laintiffs met their jurisdictional burden before the\nCourt of Federal Claims.\u201d Id.\n    On remand, the Court of Federal Claims held\nseparate trials on liability and damages. On June 4,\n2007, the case proceeded to the trial on liability. Liability\nOp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed.

The primary issues addressed were:\n(1) the zone of influence of the jetties and whether\nAppellants\u2019 properties were located within that zone; (2)\nwhether the composition of the lakebed adjacent to the\nproperty was sandy or cohesive; and (3) the effectiveness\nof the beach nourishment mitigation program. Id. at 613\u2013\n14. The Court of Federal Claims concluded that, contrary\nto the allegations in Appellants\u2019 Complaints, the jetties\nwere impermeable to sand before they were encased in\nsteel. See id. at 636. The court also found that the\nUnited States was liable for 30% of erosion between 1950\nand 1970, after each owner\u2019s acquisition of his or her\nproperty. It held that, after 1970, the United States was\nresponsible for 30% of any losses to erosion that had not\nbeen effectively mitigated. Id. at 656. In so concluding,\nthe Court of Federal Claims \u201cheard testimony from 22\nwitnesses and received some 75 exhibits into evidence.\u201d\nId. at 608.\n\fBANKS   v. US                                             8\n\n\n\n    Following the Liability Opinion, Appellants made\nadditional motions, including a Motion in Limine based\non the law-of-the-case doctrine to preclude (1) all evidence\nthat the erosion suffered by Appellants was not\npermanent and irreversible; and (2) evidence relating to\nthe composition of the nearshore lakebed adjacent to\nAppellants\u2019 properties. J.A. 1859. The Court of Federal\nClaims denied the Motion as to both requests. Appellants\nalso moved to clarify the measure of damages. The court\ngranted the motion to clarify and modified its ruling,\nfinding \u201cthat property owners at the time of the taking\nare entitled to compensation for \u2018all damages, past,\npresent, and prospective.\u2019\u201d J.A. 1755 (internal citation\nomitted).

The statute\n   of limitations did not begin to run until the Corps\n   issued the 1996, 1997, and 1999 Reports. Because\n   each [R]eport was issued less than six years\n   before [P]laintiffs filed their [C]omplaints, each\n   [C]omplaint was timely.\nBanks II, 314 F.3d at 1310 (citation omitted).\n    On remand, the Court of Federal Claims again\ndismissed the case, finding Appellants\u2019 Complaints were\nuntimely. It held its dismissal was not barred by the\nmandate rule, on the ground that this court\u2019s decision did\nnot address \u201cwhether [P]laintiffs\u2019 claims accrued before\nthe [G]overnment made its first promises of mitigation.\u201d\nBanks III, 102 Fed.

Finding that \u201cthe jetties\nwere impermeable to sand before they were encased in\nsteel sheet piling,\u201d id. at 131, the Court of Federal Claims\nheld the Appellants\u2019 claims accrued before 1952 and\n\fBANKS   v. US                                            13\n\n\n\ndismissed the case for want of jurisdiction. The Court of\nFederal Claims found that for Appellants\u2019 claims to have\nbeen timely filed, the erosion must have stabilized after\n1952, six years before the 1958 Study, which Appellants\nargued created justifiable uncertainty about the\npermanence of the taking. Id. at 133\u201334.\n    The Government argues that Banks II never decided\nwhether the claims accrued before 1952, because both this\ncourt and the Court of Federal Claims \u201caccepted as true\nthe allegations of the Complaints, including the allegation\nthat the jetties caused no damage before 1950.\u201d\nAppellee\u2019s Br. 31\u201332. The Government therefore contends\nthat the Court of Federal Claims did not violate the\nmandate rule when it considered that issue on remand.\n    The problem with the Government\u2019s position is that\nneither the Court of Federal Claims nor this court\naccepted as true all the allegations in Appellants\u2019\nComplaint. When reviewing a motion to dismiss for lack\nof subject matter jurisdiction, a court accepts only\nuncontroverted factual allegations as true for purposes of\nthe motion. Gibbs v.

The Government contends\nthat Appellants \u201cnow raise[ ] a second accrual suspension\nargument that was not raised in the [Court of Federal\nClaims]\u201d and that argument is waived.

The Court of Federal Claims cited\nAppellants\u2019 argument \u201cthat as late as 1997 it was not\nunderstood that the harbor jetties caused increased\nerosion in [P]laintiffs\u2019 zone.       The implication of\n[P]laintiffs\u2019 argument is that their claims stabilized no\nearlier than 1997 because it was not understood at that\ntime that the jetties were causing erosion in [P]laintiffs\u2019\nzone.\u201d Banks III, 102 Fed.

Accordingly, the argument is not\nwaived.\n    The Court of Federal Claims held that \u201cerosion caused\nby the jetties in [P]laintiffs\u2019 zone was a longstanding\nproblem by 1952, beginning as early as 1903,\u201d id. at 138,\nand that the forty-nine-year passage of time and \u201cwell-\ndocumented\u201d erosion would have made it \u201cclear to a\nreasonable landowner . . . that the [G]overnment had\neffected a permanent taking,\u201d 11 id. at 140.

Cl. at 140.\n     Two factors complicate determining when Appellants\nknew or should have known of their alleged takings\nclaims. First, the shorelines of Appellants\u2019 properties are\nsubject to natural erosion and other natural fluctuations.\nAs this court found in Banks II, \u201cwithout human\nintervention, [erosion] occurs naturally at a rate of\napproximately one foot per year.\u201d 314 F.3d at 1306.\nFurthermore, Lake Michigan is subject to \u201c[s]hort period\nfluctuations up to about 1.8 feet, caused by winds and\ndifferences in barometric pressures, [which] occur with\nannual frequency.\u201d J.A. 5939. Waves and storms also\naffect the shorelines: \u201cWaves from both the northwest and\nsouthwest quadrants cause movement of beach material,\nbut as evidenced by the much greater accumulation of\nbeach material north of the St. Joseph Harbor structures,\nthe predominant direction of littoral transport is\nsouthward.\u201d Id. The Government\u2019s own expert, Dr.\nRobert Nairn, a coastal engineer, testified that the slow\nprocess of erosion is \u201cmasked by far larger swings in the\nwidth of the beaches next to [P]laintiffs\u2019 properties caused\nby cross-shore sand transport, a cyclical process by which\nsand is moved offshore during times of high lake levels\nand returned to the shore during times of low lake levels.\u201d\nBanks III, 102 Fed.
