Moran, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\n                                                       2\n\f                 FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       During 1989, as the result of several individual arrests for drug offenses, the Andalusia Police\n\nDepartment became aware of a large group of people engaged in the distribution of crack cocaine\n\nin Laurel Hill, Florida, along Ebenezer Road. The illegal drug transactions primarily took place in\n\nan area referred to as the \u201cQuarters,\u201d which consisted of two mobile home trailer parks, Rosa Mae\u2019s\n\nTrailer Park and Mary Lou\u2019s Trailer Park, and the abutting stretch of Ebenezer. The Andalusia\n\nPolice Department and the Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office engaged in a joint undercover\n\ninvestigation and discovered that the primary supplier for the area was Rosa Mae Smiley Williams,\n\nwho assumed that position after the arrest of another major dealer in the area, Chico Moore, and\n\nwhose trailer was used as a base of operations for the cocaine distribution efforts of various dealers\n\nas well as a storage place for narcotics, weapons and cash. From 1989 to 1993 the police carried out\n\nextensive video and audio surveillance, meticulously documented scores of drug transactions\n\ninvolving every person who was eventually indicted, and used informants to effect controlled\n\ntransactions. On December 9 and 10, 1993, local and federal law enforcement cooperated to arrest\n\nmany members of the conspiracy.\n\n       As a result of that investigation, and as amply supported by the evidence presented at trial,\n\nthe government concluded that Rosa Mae Smiley Williams, Chico Fernandez Moore and J.W. Moore\n\nobtained their supply of cocaine and cocaine base from unindicted sources in Marianna and Miami,\n\nFlorida, and elsewhere. Rosa Mae Williams and J.W. Moore were also supplied by Chico Moore.\n\nJ.W. Moore, Chico Moore and Rosa Mae Williams would distribute drugs among the remaining\n\ndefendants. Delacey Caldwell, who became a witness for the government at trial, was the \u201cmain\u201d\n\ndrug runner for Rosa Mae Williams. He would also carry weapons to protect himself, the drugs, and\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fothers members of the drug ring who worked with him. Claudell Smiley, Arlutha Smiley, and\n\nClennon Matthews also dealt substantial quantities of narcotics they bought from or were fronted by\n\nChico Moore, and Arlutha would on occasion use stolen property to buy drugs. James Buster Moore\n\nand Jody Moore bought drugs for redistribution from Chico Moore, Rosa Mae Williams, Claudell\n\nSmiley, Clennon Matthews and J.W. Moore, the \u201cmajor\u201ddealers. Most of the other defendants were\n\n\u201crunners\u201d who would buy small quantities of cocaine to both redistribute to individuals along\n\nEbenezer Road and use personally. They would either pay for these quantities with cash or the\n\ndealers would \u201cfront\u201d the cocaine to the runners, who then sold the drugs and returned the profits to\n\nthe dealer. In exchange for selling the cocaine, the runner would be allowed to keep a portion of the\n\nproceeds or a small piece of crack (sometimes referred to as a \u201cpiece\u201d or a \u201ccookie.\u201d)\n\n       On December 8, 1993, the United States filed an indictment in the District Court of the\n\nUnited States for the Middle District of Alabama, Northern District, charging twenty-seven co-\n\ndefendants with conspiring to distribute and possess cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7841(a)(1) and \u00a7846. Immediately prior to trial, several of the co-defendants pleaded guilty,\n\nincluding Rosa Mae Smiley Williams, Chico Fernandez Moore, Bridgett Chapple, Delacy Caldwell\n\nand Clennon Matthews. These defendants entered plea agreements with the United States Attorney\n\nwherein they agreed to provide complete and truthful information about the other members of the\n\ndrug trade in exchange for the prosecution\u2019s promise to request a downward departure at sentencing.\n\nArlutha Smiley and Clarence Smiley subsequently pleaded guilty as well, entering similar plea\n\nagreements. Pursuant to these agreements Rosa Mae Smiley Williams and her sons, Arlutha Smiley\n\nand Clarence Smiley, were interviewed about their knowledge of the drug trafficking activities of\n\nthe other co-conspirators, and, although they apparently gave truthful information about several of\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fthe defendants, they refused to implicate Claudell Smiley (also Rosa Mae\u2019s son). These interviews\n\nwere conducted by Captain Jerry Newton, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Louis V. Franklin and Terry F.\n\nMoorer, and Investigator Mike Stewart of Okaloosa County Florida.\n\n        On May 16, 1994, the trial began for the remaining defendants, including Francis Williams,\n\nJ.W. Moore, James Buster Moore, Jody Moore, William Thrash and Claudell Smiley, all of whom\n\nwere ultimately convicted. The evidence at trial consisted of the testimony of several of the\n\ndefendants\u2019 former co-conspirators, police informants and several of the police officers and sheriff\u2019s\n\ndepartment officials who had conducted the investigation of the Laurel Hill conspiracy. Chico\n\nMoore and Delacy Caldwell, originally both co-defendants, gave testimony implicating themselves\n\nand, between the two of them, every other defendant. Captain Jerry Newton and Sheriff\u2019s Deputy\n\nMike Stewart, who jointly investigated the crime, both testified at trial to witnessing the criminal acts\n\nof almost all of the defendants. In addition, Shirley Tanner, a former crack addict who regularly\n\nbought, or prostituted herself to obtain, crack cocaine from the Laurel Hill group, testified in\n\nexchange for help getting treatment for her addiction. After the trial Tanner was also given $1,000\n\nwhen her mother unexpectedly needed emergency surgery and Tanner had no other means of paying\n\nher expenses. There were numerous additional witnesses at trial.\n\n        The defendants discussed above have now filed appeals on various grounds. The sheer scope\n\nof this conspiracy and the vast amount of evidence admitted at trial make it impractical and\n\ninefficient to particularly discuss the facts relating to each defendant here. Rather, we will refer to\n\nspecific portions of the record as necessary to the resolution of the various grounds for appeal.\n\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED AND ANALYSIS\n\nI. Motions for New Trial\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f       On August 2, 1994, the prosecution was informed that Captain Jerry Newton, one of the\n\nofficers who had been heavily involved in the investigation of the Laurel Hill conspiracy, was the\n\nsubject of an internal investigation by his employer, the Andalusia Police Department. On\n\nNovember 14, 1994, Captain Newton\u2019s employment was terminated. On January 12, 1995, the\n\nUnited States sent a letter to the district court hearing the Laurel Hill case, informing it of Newton\u2019s\n\ntermination and outlining the charges against him, which were (1) the falsification of records\n\npertaining to the payment of confidential informants, ostensibly in other, unrelated cases; and (2)\n\nfalse statements made to Police Chief Jerry Williamson concerning witness fees and other\n\nreimbursements paid to Captain Newton in this case. The court set a hearing for February 16, 1995,\n\nwhich was continued until March 15-16, 1995, to allow further investigation of the matter. At the\n\nhearing, the court considered the various motions filed in response to the government\u2019s disclosure\n\nof Newton\u2019s improprieties. Among other matters, the court heard motions for a new trial from both\n\nthe tried and convicted defendants, as well as those who had pleaded guilty and sought either new\n\nsentencing hearings or the opportunity to revoke their pleas. In an order filed September 4, 1996, the\n\ncourt denied these motions and numerous appellants now contest that decision. We will not reverse\n\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling on this matter unless we find that it abused its discretion. United States v.\n\nJones, 913 F.2d 1552, 1565 (11th Cir. 1990).\n\n       We will first address the claims of Clennon Matthews, Rosa Mae Williams and Arlutha\n\nSmiley, who pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charges and agreed to give truthful statements about\n\nother defendants in exchange for the prosecution\u2019s promise to request on their behalf downward\n\ndepartures at sentencing. The government honored its plea agreement with Clennon Matthews, but\n\nrefused to move for a downward departure for Rosa Mae and Arlutha Smiley because the statements\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fthey made were not entirely truthful. Specifically, the latter defendants stated that they were\n\nunaware of the nature and extent of their son/brother\u2019s, Claudell Smiley\u2019s, involvement in the\n\nconspiracy, when other evidence clearly indicated that this was not true (interviews, Rosa Mae\n\nSmiley Williams, 3/25/94; Arlutha Smiley, 4/25/94 and 3/3l/94). On appeal, the three defendants\n\nclaim they are either entitled to a new sentencing hearing or to revoke their pleas altogether.\n\nClennon Matthews argues that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known about Captain Jerry\n\nNewton\u2019s corruption, and Rosa Mae Williams and Arlutha Smiley claim prejudice because Captain\n\nNewton participated in taking their statements, from which statements the prosecution concluded that\n\nthe defendants were not being completely truthful. Matthews, Williams and Smiley argue, in\n\nessence, that the prosecution was required to disclose Detective Newton\u2019s suspension under Brady\n\nv. Maryland. 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963).\n\n       The district court denied the request for a new trial, relying on the traditional rule that by\n\naccepting a guilty plea a defendant waives all non-jurisdictional defenses. See Martin v. Kemp, 760\n\nF.2d 1244, 1246 (11th Cir. 1985). Relying on a Fifth Circuit opinion, the court further noted that\n\nthe defendants who pleaded guilty had, in doing so, waived their right to trial and consequently could\n\nnot seek a new one. See Williams v. United States, 290 F.2d 217, 218 (5th Cir. 1961).\n\n       Although usually stated as axiomatic, the rule that a defendant who pleads guilty waives all\n\nnon-jurisdictional defenses is not absolute. See, e.g., United States v. Kaiser, 893 F.2d 1300 (11th\n\nCir. 1990) (challenges to convictions upon guilty pleas are limited to whether the underlying plea\n\nwas counseled and voluntary); United States v. Wright, 43 F.3d 491 (10th Cir. 1994) (plea of guilty\n\ndoes not prevent defendant from arguing that his claim was improperly induced); Acha v. United\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fStates, 910 F.2d 28 (1st Cir. 1990) (guilty plea does not prevent defendant from raising claim for\n\nineffective assistance of counsel in the process by which the plea was accepted).\n\n       We do not need to decide today, however, whether a guilty plea waives a defendant\u2019s claim\n\nunder Brady, or -- assuming that a Brady claim is not waived by a guilty plea \u2013 whether the Brady\n\nmaterial must be known to the prosecution before the plea or merely before sentencing. Nor do we\n\nneed to decide whether a suspension, like Detective Newton\u2019s suspension, is sufficiently material\n\nto mandate Brady disclosure. Even if we accept that a guilty plea does not waive a defendant\u2019s\n\nBrady claim, that Brady information learned by the prosecutors after the plea but before sentencing\n\nmust be disclosed, and that Detective Newton\u2019s suspension is material enough to require disclosure\n\nunder Brady, the defendants\u2019 arguments must still be rejected.\n\n       First, Clennon Matthews\u2019 plea and sentencing both occurred prior to August 2, 1994, the date\n\nupon which the prosecution acknowledges that it became aware of the disciplinary investigation of\n\nDetective Newton. Matthews does not argue that the police department\u2019s knowledge of the\n\ninvestigation was imputed to the prosecution prior to this date, and he has not otherwise shown that\n\nthe prosecution knew of the investigation at either the time of his plea or his sentencing. Moreover,\n\nthere is no indication in Clennon Matthews\u2019 sentencing record1 that the court relied on Officer\n\nNewton\u2019s testimony or his role in the investigation. Rather, the transcript reveals that the\n\ngovernment\u2019s evidence against Matthews consisted primarily of statements by Chico Moore, Shirley\n\nTanner and Deputy Michael Stewart. Accordingly, there is no reason to believe that a disclosure of\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       The transcript of Clennon Matthews\u2019 sentencing hearing, dated July 13, 1994, before Judge\nIra DeMent, can be found at Volume 27 of the trial record.\n                                                 8\n\fthe police department\u2019s investigation of Officer Newton would have affected Matthew\u2019s decision\n\nto plea.\n\n           Similarly, Rosa Mae Williams and Arlutha Smiley pleaded guilty on March 14 and April 21,\n\n1994, months before the government was made aware of the Newton information.               Thus, the\n\ngovernment\u2019s obligation to disclose, if any, had not arisen. Unlike Matthews, however, Williams\n\nand Smiley were sentenced October 19 and October 20, 1994. In essence, these appellants argue that\n\nthey are entitled to a new sentencing hearing because, if it had been made aware of Newton\u2019s\n\ndishonesty, the sentencing court would have been less likely to honor the prosecution\u2019s request that\n\ntheir plea agreements be disregarded on the ground that Williams and Smiley had failed to provide\n\ntruthful statements about the activities of other members of the conspiracy, particularly Claudell\n\nSmiley.\n\n           We disagree. Even if we continue to assume that Williams and Smiley can raise a Brady\n\nclaim after pleading guilty, that Brady information learned by the prosecution after the plea must be\n\ndisclosed, and that Brady would require disclosing Detective Newton\u2019s suspension, the alleged error\n\nis harmless. Had the internal investigation been disclosed, it is unlikely that the government would\n\nhave used Newton at sentencing. Even without considering Newton\u2019s testimony, however, the\n\ntranscript contains overwhelming evidence implicating both Arlutha Smiley and Rosa Mae Williams\n\nin the conspiracy and indicating that they would have been aware of Claudell Smiley\u2019s involvement.2\n\nFurther, Captain Newton\u2019s involvement in every aspect of the events relevant to the pleas and\n\nsentencing is independently corroborated by other evidence. The transcripts indicate that Okaloosa\n\n\n\n           2\n         Such evidence is detailed infra in Section VI, where appellants\u2019 sentencing claims are\naddressed, and we consequently need not review the supporting facts here.\n                                                  9\n\fCounty Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Stewart was present at both interviews of Arlutha Smiley, on March 31 and\n\nApril 25, 1994. And the interview of Rosa Mae Williams, who was apparently interviewed by\n\nNewton alone and thus presents the most obvious point at which he could have influenced or\n\nmisrepresented the content of her statement, was recorded and transcribed. The trial record indicates\n\nthat the sentencing judge was presented with the transcripts of these interviews and had the\n\nopportunity to independently assess what the witnesses said. Moreover, between the trial and the\n\nhearing, the court considered the testimony of numerous witnesses who contradicted the statements\n\nArlutha and Rosa Mae made about their relationship with Claudell, among others. For these reasons,\n\ninformation about the police department\u2019s internal investigation of Captain Newton\u2019s dishonest\n\nconduct does not warrant a revocation of their pleas or new sentencing hearings.\n\n        With respect to the defendants found guilty at trial, we find for the same reasons that it is not\n\nreasonably probable that a disclosure of the information at issue would have changed the outcome\n\nof the trial or the sentences of those convicted. As with the pleas discussed above, at the time of trial\n\nthe government was unaware that Newton was the subject of investigation. Moreover, any testimony\n\nprovided by Newton was corroborated, often by multiple witnesses. Even if we disregard Newton\u2019s\n\ntestimony entirely, the testimony of Shirley Tanner, Delacey Caldwell and Chico Moore provides\n\nample evidence upon which the jury could have based its decision to convict. We accordingly\n\nconclude that the internal investigation of Officer Newton was not material under the Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s Brady decision.\n\nII. Exclusion of Shirley Tanner\u2019s Arrest\n\n        One of the government\u2019s chief witnesses at trial was Shirley Tanner, a drug addict who\n\ncooperated with the police during the conspiracy investigation and participated in controlled\n\n\n                                                   10\n\fundercover drug buys from almost all of the defendants. When questioned about her motives for\n\ntestifying, Tanner stated that she cooperated with the government because they promised to put her\n\nin a drug rehabilitation program and help her get her life back together. At trial defendants sought\n\nto admit Covington County docket sheets indicating that at one time Tanner had been arrested for\n\nthe unauthorized use of a vehicle.     Relying on Federal Rules of Evidence 405(b) and 608(b),\n\ndefendants intended to use such evidence to show that the charges against Tanner were dropped in\n\nexchange for her cooperation in the conspiracy case and that was her true motive for testifying.\n\nDefendants\u2019 attorneys, however, were unable to show any connection between the government\u2019s\n\nprevious failure to bring charges on the matter of the unauthorized use of a vehicle and Tanner\u2019s\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy case (Rec.17:1184). Moreover, both Tanner and the prosecution\n\nmaintained (and offered proof) that the docket sheets were in error and that Tanner was never\n\ncharged in relation to the crime, which they claimed had arisen from a misunderstanding with the\n\nowner of the vehicle and was for that reason dropped. The trial judge allowed the defense to\n\nextensively question Tanner about the unauthorized-use accusations and her role in taking the\n\nvehicle, but once Tanner had specifically denied that she was arrested, the court refused to let the\n\ndefense question her further about whether she was arrested or admit documentary evidence to that\n\neffect. (Rec.17:1180-92).\n\n       Federal Rule of Evidence 405 generally prohibits the use of specific prior acts as proof of\n\ncharacter to show action in conformity with a character trait evidenced by the behavior. Evidence\n\nof prior conduct may, however, be used as circumstantial evidence of a non-character issue, such as\n\nmotive, intent, opportunity, knowledge, or other issues material to the charge. Where impeachment\n\nis concerned, Rule 608(b) provides that the trial court may in its discretion permit questioning about\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fa witness\u2019 prior bad acts on cross-examination, if the acts bear on the witness\u2019 character for\n\ntruthfulness. If the witness denies the conduct, such acts may not be proved by extrinsic evidence\n\nand the questioning party must take the witness\u2019 answer, United States v. Cohen, 631 F.2d 1223,\n\n1175-76 (5th Cir. 1980); United States v. Herzberg, 558 F.2d 1219, 1223-24 (5th Cir. 1977), unless\n\nthe evidence would be otherwise admissible as bearing on a material issue of the case. U.S. v. Calle,\n\n822 F.2d 1016, 1021 (11th Cir. 1987). Limitations on the scope and extent of cross-examination\n\nare matters expressly committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and we review such\n\ndecisions only for a clear abuse of discretion. See United States v. Sudderth, 681 F.2d 990, 996 (5th\n\nCir. 1982).\n\n       Tanner\u2019s alleged arrest for unauthorized use of a vehicle does not bear on a material issue in\n\nthe conspiracy case and Rule 405 consequently does not apply. Even if we assume that questions\n\nabout the misconduct itself were permissible as bearing on her credibility, Rule 608 specifically\n\nprohibits extrinsic proof of such acts and consequently the district court properly excluded the docket\n\nsheets purporting to detail the arrest. Because the government claimed that the arrest had never taken\n\nplace and the docket sheets were in error, and because defendants\u2019 theory that the charges had been\n\nbrought and dropped in exchange for Tanner\u2019s cooperation were speculative and unsupported by any\n\nevidence, the district court also had the discretion to prohibit further questions about the alleged\n\narrest until defendants could find support for their theory. Thus we cannot say the trial judge abused\n\nhis discretion in excluding evidence of Tanner\u2019s alleged arrest.\n\nIII. Multiple and Single Conspiracies\n\n       Defendants William Thrash, James Buster Moore, Francis Williams and Jody Moore argue\n\nthat their conspiracy convictions are invalid because although the indictment charged a single\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fcocaine distribution conspiracy involving all defendants, the proof at trial established only multiple\n\nindividual conspiracies between the various defendants and Rosa Mae Williams.         We do not reverse\n\nconvictions on this ground unless the variance is material and substantially prejudiced the\n\ndefendants. United States v. Alred, 144 F.3d at 1414 (11th Cir. 1998). In determining whether any\n\nvariance was material, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the government and inquire\n\nwhether a reasonable jury could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that a single conspiracy\n\nexisted. United States v. Coy, 19 F.3d 629, 633 (11th Cir. 1994). We will not disturb the jury\u2019s\n\ndetermination that the defendants were engaged in one far-reaching conspiracy if that finding was\n\nsupported by substantial evidence. Alred, 144 F.3d at 1414 citing United States v. Calderon, 127\n\nF.3d 1314, 1327 (11th Cir.1997). To decide whether the jury could have found a single conspiracy,\n\nwe review \"(1) whether a common goal existed; (2) the nature of the underlying scheme; and (3)\n\nthe overlap of participants.\" Id. Only if we conclude that the proof at trial established only multiple\n\nindividual conspiracies do we examine whether any substantial prejudice resulted to the defendants.\n\n       Appellants acknowledge that both Rosa Mae Williams and Chico Moore functioned as\n\ncocaine suppliers to many of the co-defendants, and thus that there were numerous individual\n\nconspiracies to distribute cocaine between these suppliers and the lower-level dealer defendants.\n\nThey argue, however, that because the evidence at trial failed to link the various suppliers, dealers\n\nand buyers to each other in an all-inclusive conspiracy, the single-conspiracy convictions violated\n\nKotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946) (holding that if at trial\n\nthe government produces evidence that each defendant had a conspiratorial relationship with a single\n\noutside person, but fails to show that the defendants also were aware of and conspired with each\n\nother, the government has proved only multiple individual conspiracies rather than one agreement\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fencompassing all defendants). We disagree with appellants and find the situation before us\n\ndistinguishable from Kotteakos.\n\n       At trial, Delacey Caldwell testified that he frequently sold cocaine on Ebenezer Road, the\n\nstreet running through Laurel Hill, where most of the individual drug sales took place. He stated that\n\nJ.W. Moore, Buster Moore, Claudell Smiley and Rosa Mae Smiley would frequently buy cocaine\n\nfrom an outside supplier named Luis. These four (who, in addition to Chico Moore, the prosecution\n\nrefers to as the \u201cmajor players\u201d in the drug distribution ring) would then sell to the other defendants,\n\nincluding Delacey Caldwell, who would then deal the drugs on the street to individual buyers\n\n(Rec.20:1830). Thus, when Delacey Caldwell went to deal drugs he would first buy a quantity from\n\nRosa Mae or Claudell, or, if neither had a supply, from J.W. or Buster Moore (Rec.20-1831). To\n\nassist the sales, while there were dealers on the street Rosa Mae Smiley would monitor a police\n\nscanner that she kept in her trailer and, when she received notice of police presence in the Laurel Hill\n\narea, would come out and notify the dealers, who would then temporarily get off the street (Rec.20-\n\n1832). Similarly, Chico Moore testified that before he was arrested he would supply drugs to various\n\nmembers of the conspiracy and gave testimony that specifically indicates the members of the\n\nconspiracy were working in conjunction with him and others to achieve a common goal of\n\npurchasing and distributing drugs. For example, he testified that on at least one occasion he spoke\n\nwith his cousins Jody and Buster Moore about arranging for a drug purchase in another town, Fort\n\nWatson, and that at other times he had bought and sold cocaine both with Buster Moore and Thrash\n\nWilliams (Rec.22-2329-30, 2356). He also testified that he had previously lived with Francis\n\nWilliams, during which time Claudell Smiley would come to their house to purchase cocaine, and\n\ndiscussed transactions with Rosa Mae Smiley (Rec.22-2346, 2371). The remainder of the record is\n\n\n                                                  14\n\freplete with testimony connecting the various defendants to one another in their distribution efforts.\n\nViewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the government, the jury could reasonably have\n\nconcluded that the defendants were interconnected in a complex but single scheme to distribute\n\ncocaine in the Laurel Hill area. A reasonable trier of fact could find that all of the defendants were\n\nmutually interested and involved participants in an open Laurel Hill drug market. See United States\n\nv. Adams, 1 F.3d 1566, 1584 (11th Cir.1993); United States v. Reed, 980 F.2d 1568, 1581 (11th Cir.\n\n1993). Accordingly, we find that there was no material variance between the indictment and the\n\nproof presented at trial.\n\nIV. Proof of a Single Conspiracy\n\n        Appellants William Thrash, James Buster Moore, Francis Williams and Jody Moore next\n\ncontend that insufficient evidence was presented to prove their involvement in a single large-scale\n\nconspiracy. To sustain a conviction for conspiring to distribute narcotics the government must prove\n\nthat 1) an agreement existed between two or more persons to distribute the drugs; 2) that the\n\ndefendant at issue knew of the conspiratorial goal; and 3) that he knowingly joined or participated\n\nin the illegal venture. United States v. Guerrero, 935 F.2d 189, 191 (11th Cir. 1991). \u201cThe\n\ngovernment may establish a defendants\u2019 knowing participation in the conspiracy through proof of\n\nsurrounding circumstances, such as acts committed by the defendant that furthered the purpose of\n\nthe conspiracy.\u201d Id. The evidence discussed above is sufficient basis from which the jury could\n\nhave concluded that all three of these prongs were met and defendants were consequently guilty of\n\nparticipating in a single distribution conspiracy.\n\nV. Venue\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f       Appellants James Moore, William Thrash, Francis Williams and Jody Moore next claim that\n\nthe district court for the Middle District of Alabama was an improper venue in which to hold the\n\ntrial. They argue first that the government erroneously relied on Chico Moore\u2019s testimony, in which\n\nhe stated that he made numerous cocaine buys in Alabama, in determining the geographical\n\nboundaries of the conspiracy. Appellants base this argument on their now discredited claim that the\n\ngovernment failed to prove a single conspiracy involving all defendants and consequently venue\n\nmust be determined with respect to each individual conspiracy, considering only the locale of the\n\nacts constituting that particular crime. Defendants further argue that in determining proper venue\n\nthe district court should not have considered the May 27, 1993 arrest of Willie Sconiers in Andalusia,\n\nAlabama, because he was subsequently acquitted. We find this latter argument to be without merit.\n\n       \u201cThis Court reviews a challenge to venue in the light most favorable to the government, and\n\nmakes all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury verdict when deciding\n\nwhether the government has proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an offense has\n\noccurred in the trial district.\u201d United States v. Smith, 918 F.2d 1551, 1557 (11th Cir. 1990). Title\n\n18 of the United States Code, governing the jurisdiction and venue of the federal courts, provides\n\nthat \u201cany offense begun in one district and completed in another, or committed in more than one\n\ndistrict, may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun,\n\ncontinued, or completed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3237(a). Where a conspiracy is concerned, venue is thus\n\nproper in any district where \u201can overt act\u201d was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Smith,\n\n918 F.2d at 1557. The overt act need not be committed by a defendant in the case; the acts of\n\naccomplices and unindicted co-conspirators can also expose the defendant to jurisdiction. See\n\nUnited States v. Delia, 944 F.2d 1010, 1014 (2d Cir. 1991). Moreover, the fact that a majority of a\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fconspiracy\u2019s activity took place in a venue other than the one where the trial takes place does not\n\ndestroy venue. U.S. v. Dabbs, 134 F.3d 1071, 1079 (11th Cir. 1998).\n\n       As discussed above, the government proved that William Thrash, James Buster Moore,\n\nFrancis Williams and Jody Moore were involved in a single drug distribution conspiracy, one of the\n\nparticipants of which was Chico Moore. The defendants do not dispute that Chico Moore\u2019s\n\ntestimony established that he and other defendants engaged in numerous overt acts in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy in the geographic area encompassing the Middle District of Alabama. Nor do they\n\ndispute, as the district court observed, that several other witnesses, including Shirley Tanner, Timmy\n\nBarlow, Delacey Caldwell, Sylvia Matthews, Mike Stewart and Tony Harrison, provided similar\n\ntestimony. For example, Sylvia Matthews testified that Chico Moore and J.W. Moore would come\n\nto her home in Andalusia, Alabama, to sell her cocaine. Having established a single conspiracy, the\n\ngovernment only had to show that one co-conspirator took such acts within the district court\u2019s venue\n\nwhich, in light of the testimony presented at trial, we find it did.3\n\nVI. Claims Based on the Sentencing Guidelines\n\n       The defendants attack their sentences on various grounds. We observe at the outset that we\n\nwill not disturb the district court\u2019s determination on these matters unless its decision was clearly\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The testimony discussed in this section is alone sufficient to establish venue in the Middle\nDistrict of Alabama, and we consequently need not discuss appellants\u2019 argument that in determining\nvenue the district court should not have considered the arrest of Willie Sconiers in Andalusia,\nAlabama. We note, however, that the acquittal of a co-defendant is a reflection only of a lack of\nproof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and is thus analytically distinct from the determination\nof whether the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the acquitted party acted\nin furtherance of the conspiracy in a particular geographic location. See, United States v. Nocoll,\n664 F.2d 1308, 1311 (5th Cir. Unit B, 1982) overruled on other grounds by United States v. Henry,\n749 F.2d 203 (1984).\n                                                  17\n\ferroneous. U.S. v. Gates, 967 F.2d 497 (11th Cir. 1992); United States v. Robinson, 935 F.2d 201,\n\n205 (11th Cir. 1991).\n\n        A. Base Sentencing Levels\n\n        Defendants William Thrash, James Buster Moore, Jody Moore and Francis Williams argue\n\nthat the trial court erred in determining the amount of cocaine attributable to them for purposes of\n\ndetermining their base offense level under Guideline \u00a71B1.3(a). At sentencing, the government bore\n\nthe burden of establishing the drug quantity level by a preponderance of the evidence and we reverse\n\nthe sentencing court\u2019s drug determination only if it was made in clear error. United States v.\n\nMertilus, 111 F.3d 870, 873 (11th Cir. 1997). In determining the base level of the charged offense,\n\nthe district court must consider as relevant all conduct actually undertaken by, or taken at the\n\ndirection of, the defendant, \u00a71B1.3(a)(1)(A), and, in the case of a conspiracy, all acts by other\n\nparticipants that were both reasonably foreseeable and in furtherance of the conspiracy,\n\n\u00a71B1.3(a)(1)(B).

Ismond, 993 F.2d 1498,\n\n1499 (11th Cir. 1993).\n\n        James Buster Moore\u2019s sentence was based on the sentencing court\u2019s determination that, while\n\na member of the Laurel Hill conspiracy, he was involved in transactions totaling between 1.5 to 5\n\nkilograms of cocaine (Rec.40:6-9). At sentencing, the government called Chico Moore, who testified\n\nthat during the two-year period (1991-1993) that Buster was a member of the conspiracy Moore had\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fsold between one-half and one kilogram of cocaine to Buster (Rec.40:6-9); that Buster and his\n\nbrother had been arrested in possession of at least 54 grams (Rec.40:12); and that Buster regularly\n\nsold $50 rocks (or \u201ccookies\u201d) to at least four runners.4 Delacey Caldwell, a former crack addict who\n\nwas indicted and charged with being part of the Laurel Hill conspiracy, also testified that between\n\n1992 and 1993 he bought between two and three ounces of crack from Buster (Rec.40:42-3); that he\n\nhad witnessed Buster buy one or two ounces from Claudell Smiley (Rec.40:45); and that he knew\n\nof five or six other runners who regularly purchased from Buster as well (Rec.40:43). In addition,\n\nseveral of the witnesses at trial testified that they had either witnessed or participated in several more\n\ntransactions with Buster Moore. In light of this evidence, the district court\u2019s determination that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s base offense level should be predicated on transactions totaling 1.5 to 5 kilograms of\n\ncrack cocaine was not clearly erroneous.\n\n        The remaining three defendants contesting their base sentences, William Thrash, Jody Moore\n\nand Francis Williams, were each assigned a base cocaine level of between 500 milligrams and 1.5\n\nkilograms. The sentencing court did not err in setting these levels. For four to six months during\n\n1991, Jody Moore began buying cocaine from his cousin Chico Moore, who estimated that he sold\n\nJody a total of one-quarter kilogram during that period (Rec.42:18-9). In addition, Chico testified\n\nthat Jody accompanied him on several purchasing trips outside of Laurel Hill, where they bought a\n\n\n\n\n        4\n          As do several other appellants, Buster insists that Chico Moore was not part of the Laurel\nHill conspiracy and consequently argues that the district court should not have considered\ntransactions involving Chico in determining the base offense level. There is clearly no merit to this\nargument. Chico Moore was one of the twenty-seven defendants charged in this case and has\npleaded guilty to the conspiracy to possess and distribute charges. We have upheld the verdict of\na single conspiracy in which Moore was a co-conspirator. Thus, their joint drug activities clearly\nconstitute acts in furtherance of the conspiracy under \u00a71B1.3(a)(1)(B).\n                                                   19\n\ftotal of approximately 20 ounces, or approximately 560 grams. Id. This testimony alone establishes\n\nthat Jody Moore was involved with a minimum of 500 milligrams of cocaine.\n\n       Similarly, Francis Williams\u2019 participation in various drug buys with Chico Moore likewise\n\nputs her well over the 500 milligram mark. The evidence establishes that she and Chico lived\n\ntogether and that he regularly sold cocaine out of their home, often with her present and assisting,\n\nin sales totaling at least a half kilogram (Rec.22:2361-2). Additionally, she went on several\n\npurchasing trips with Chico, on at least one of which he bought a full kilogram and Williams assisted\n\nby folding the money. (Rec.37:21).\n\n       Finally, William Thrash argues that in sentencing him the trial court erred when it relied not\n\non his own conduct but on conduct of his co-conspirators, particularly Chico Moore. We disagree.\n\nThe evidence shows that during 1993 (the only year of the conspiracy that Thrash lived in Laurel\n\nHill), he dealt repeatedly with Chico Moore; took Chico on a 22-gram buy from Thrash\u2019s regular\n\nsources (Rec.22:2350-51); was fronted between a half- and a quarter-ounce of cocaine by Chico on\n\nnumerous occasions (Rec.22:2351-53); regularly sold the fronted cocaine in Laurel Hill\n\n(Rec.22:2351); traveled to Crestview with Chico to make a $1,600 purchase (Rec.22:2355-56); and\n\nto Pensacola to buy 2 ounces for $2,000 from one of Chico\u2019s sources. At this level of involvement\n\nit was evident to William Thrash that Chico Moore was a major drug supplier in the Laurel Hill area,\n\nand his buys and sells in this capacity were reasonably foreseeable to Thrash and clearly in\n\nfurtherance of the cocaine distribution conspiracy.\n\n       B. Firearm Enhancement\n\n       Defendants Arlutha Smiley, Clennon Matthews and Jody Moore argue that the district court\n\nerred in enhancing their sentence classification under U.S.S.G. \u00a72D1.1(b)(1), which provides for a\n\n\n                                                 20\n\ftwo-point increase in drug trafficking cases where the defendant possessed a firearm. A defendant\u2019s\n\nsentence may also be enhanced for possession by a co-conspirator if (1) the actual possessor is\n\ncharged as a co-conspirator; (2) the co-conspirator possessed the firearm in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy; and (3) the defendant who receives the enhancement was involved in the conspiracy at\n\nthe time of the possession. United States v. Otero, 890 F.2d 366, 367 (11th Cir. 1989) (per curiam).\n\nSee also United States v. Gates, 967 F.2d 497 (11th Cir. 1992) cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1011 (1992).\n\nThe enhancement is only appropriate if the government establishes these facts by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence. See U.S. v. Ignancio Munio, 909 F.2d 436, 439 (11th Cir. 1990) cert. denied, 499\n\nU.S. 938 (1991).\n\n       Four of the appellants\u2019 co-conspirators possessed firearms during the course of the\n\nconspiracy: Delacey Caldwell was videotaped holding a gun during one drug transaction, and he\n\nlater testified that guns were carried for protection; nineteen guns were recovered from Rosa Mae\u2019s\n\nhome, the focal point of many of the largest deals; the police found a loaded gun next to a quantity\n\nof crack cocaine under the sofa cushion on which Arlutha Smiley was sleeping when he was\n\narrested; and Claudell Smiley gave his runners guns to use to protect their cocaine cargo (Rec.38\u201313,\n\n14, 19; 20:34-36). This evidence establishes all three prongs of the Otterro test and the sentencing\n\ncourt\u2019s enhancement of appellants\u2019 sentences was consequently not clearly erroneous.\n\n       C. Employment Record\n\n       Arlutha Smiley argues that he is entitled to a downward reduction in his sentence on the basis\n\nof a favorable employment record and the fact that he has substantial family responsibilities.\n\nGuidelines \u00a75H1.5 provides that although a defendant\u2019s employment record is not usually relevant\n\nin determining sentence modification, it may be relevant in determining the condition of probation\n\n\n                                                 21\n\for supervised release, such as the appropriate number of hours of home detention.          Similarly,\n\nGuidelines \u00a75H1.6 provides that although family ties and responsibilities are not usually relevant\n\nin determining sentence modification, they might be relevant to determining the amount of\n\nrestitution or fine.\n\n        In United States v. Mogel, 956 F.2d 1555 (11th Cir. 1992), the court considered these\n\nguidelines and explained that to overcome their narrow realm of applicability a defendant must show\n\nthat his employment and family concerns were \u201cpresent to a degree substantially in excess of that\n\nwhich ordinarily is involved in the offense.\u201d Arlutha Smiley presented evidence that he has\n\nconsistently held a job as a truck driver and has a seven-year old son to whom he contributes\n\nsupport. These facts do not, however, distinguish him significantly from the rest of the general\n\npopulation and the district court did not err in denying this departure.\n\n        D. Minor or Minimal Participant\n\n        Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, the sentencing court must reduce a defendant\u2019s offense level by four\n\nlevels if it determines that the defendant was a \u201cminimal\u201d participant in the convicted offense,\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a73B1.2(a), or by two levels if the defendant was a \u201cminor\u201d participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a73B1.2(b).\n\nA \u201cminimal participant\u201d is any conspiracy defendant who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of\n\nthose involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a73B1.2, Application note 1. A \u201cminor\n\nparticipant\u201d is any defendant who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but [his] role could\n\nnot be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a73B1.2, Application note 3. The application note further\n\nprovides:\n\n        It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will be used\n        infrequently. It would be appropriate, for example, for someone who played no other\n        role in a very large drug smuggling operation than to off load part of a single\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f       marihuana shipment, or in a case where an individual was recruited as a courier for\n       a single smuggling transaction involving a small shipment of drugs.\n\nId. at notes 2 and 3. Defendant bears the burden of showing the appropriateness of this departure\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence. Ignancio Munio, 909 F.2d at 439. The district court,\n\nconsidering a drug distribution conspiracy, is justified in denying a downward departure under these\n\nsections to any defendant who regularly sells or purchases drugs, U.S. v. Lokey, 945 F.2d 825 (5th\n\nCir. 1991), or to any defendant who serves as a liaison between other co-conspirators or arranges\n\ntransactions, U.S. v. Gates, 967 F.2d 497 (11th Cir. 1992).\n\n       Francis Williams and James Buster Moore were classified as minor participants under\n\n\u00a73B1.2(a). They contend, however, that the district court should have classified them as minimal\n\nparticipants under \u00a73B1.2(b) and granted them an additional two-level downward departure. We\n\ndisagree. As discussed above, although Francis Williams undertook few, if any, independent drug\n\ntransactions, she was heavily involved in Chico Moore\u2019s regular Laurel Hill deals and cocaine\n\npurchasing trips outside of the area. With respect to Buster Moore\u2019s claim, Delacey Caldwell\n\ntestified that Moore sold him, and at least five other persons, cocaine for personal use and\n\nredistribution over a two-year period (Rec.40:41-42). In light of both Williams\u2019 and Caldwell\u2019s\n\nextensive involvement in numerous transactions, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred\n\nin refusing to classify them as minimal participants.\n\n       Jody Moore claims that he is entitled to classification as a minor participant because his\n\ninvolvement was primarily for personal use instead of distribution. As previously discussed,\n\nhowever, the evidence establishes that he accompanied his cousin Chico Moore on numerous\n\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fsubstantial cocaine purchases and consequently we find that the district court did not err in finding\n\nthat he was not among the less culpable of defendants.\n\n       E. Supervisory Role\n\n       Clennon Matthews argues that the district court erred in increasing his sentence level by three\n\npoints for being a manager or supervisor of at least one other person in a criminal organization that\n\ninvolved five or more participants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b) and Application note 2. Among other\n\nfactors, the sentencing court should consider the nature of defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy\n\nas well as his use and recruitment of other members. Id. at note 4. In a drug distribution case such\n\nas this one, the management enhancement is appropriate for a defendant who arranges drug\n\ntransactions, negotiates sales with others, and hires others to work for the conspiracy. U.S. v.\n\nStanley, 24 F.3d 1314, 1323 (11th Cir. 1994); U.S. v. Clavis, 956 F.2d 1079, 1096 (11th Cir. 1992).\n\n       Matthews argues that his sentence should not have been enhanced for a managerial role\n\nbecause he did not have control over others or the power to force them to engage in criminal acts.\n\nThis argument misinterprets the relevant inquiry under the guidelines \u2013 control over co-conspirators\n\nis not required. Matthews does not dispute that the evidence at trial established that he fronted or\n\ndirectly sold cocaine to numerous \u201crunners\u201d who would then sell the drug to buyers along Ebenezer\n\nroad, giving Matthews the resulting profit (Rec.27:18-9). In exchange for this service the runners\n\nwould generally be entitled to a small amount of cocaine for their own personal use. This undisputed\n\nactivity was sufficient to justify the sentencing court\u2019s enhancement under \u00a73B1.1(b).\n\n       F. Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n       Claudell Smiley and Clennon Matthews argue that the district court erred in denying their\n\nrequest for a two-point decrease under U.S.S.G. \u00a73E1.1, which permits the decrease if the defendant\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f\u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d Another point may be subtracted\n\nif defendant shows that he provided timely information about his involvement or gave the\n\nprosecution timely notice of his intent to plead guilty. We have observed that \u201c[t]he district court\n\nis in a unique position to evaluate whether a particular defendant has truly accepted the\n\nresponsibility for his actions.\u201d U.S. v. Hromada, 49 F.3d 685, 691 (11th Cir. 1995). Accordingly,\n\nwe will not disturb its determination of this issue unless we find the denial lacked foundation.\n\nUnited States v. De La Rosa, 922 F.2d 675, 680 (11th Cir. 1991).\n\n       The district court denied Clennon Matthew\u2019s request because he admitted at sentencing that\n\nhe had continued to use marijuana while the trial was pending. The guidelines provide that the\n\nsentencing judge must consider all relevant information, including whether the defendant has\n\nvoluntarily terminated the criminal conduct. See also United States v. De La Rosa, 922 F.2d 675,\n\n680 (11th Cir. 1991). Matthew\u2019s continued use of illegal drugs constitutes in part a continuation of\n\nthe offense for which he was indicted and the district court\u2019s denial of the decrease was consequently\n\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\n       Claudell Smiley argues that he is entitled to a decrease in his sentence because although he\n\ndid not cooperate prior to trial or testify, after his conviction he agreed to give a statement to the\n\ngovernment for use in later prosecutions of additional members of the drug trade. In exchange for\n\nthis cooperation, the prosecution recommended a five-point downward departure which the district\n\ncourt accepted at sentencing. Claudell maintains that his cooperation entitles him to an additional\n\ntwo-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. We disagree.\n\n       Although a defendant\u2019s failure to plead guilty does not automatically preclude a reduction\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility, only in rare situations will a defendant who is convicted at a trial\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fbe entitled to the decrease. U.S.S.G. \u00a73E1.1, Application Note 2. The adjustment \u201cis not intended\n\nto apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial . . . is convicted, and\n\nonly then admits guilt.\u201d Id. There are rare circumstances in which the reduction is allowed for a\n\ntried and convicted defendant, such as where he went to trial only to assert and preserve\n\nconstitutional and other issues that do not relate to factual guilt. Id. Even then, however, the district\n\ncourt\u2019s determination of whether to grant the reduction should be \u201cbased primarily upon pre-trial\n\nstatements and conduct.\u201d Id. Claudell Smiley did not cooperate with the government during the\n\ninvestigation and forced the prosecution to seek a conviction by trial. Particularly in light of the\n\nfive-point downward departure that he has already been granted in exchange for his post-trial\n\ncooperation, the district court did not clearly err in denying the additional reduction.\n\nVII. Constitutionality of Crack Cocaine Sentencing Guidelines\n\n        Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7841 and 846, and the corresponding sentence enhancement provisions\n\nat U.S.S.G. \u00a72D1.1, an individual convicted of dealing or possessing crack cocaine (an intense form\n\nof cocaine base) is subject to longer sentences than a person convicted of dealing or possessing the\n\nsame amount of powdered cocaine. Specifically, crimes involving 50 grams or more of cocaine base\n\n(crack) are subject to the same 10 years minimum sentence as crimes involving 5,000 grams of\n\ncocaine powder (commonly known as the \u201c100 to 1 ratio\u201d). See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii)\n\n(cocaine base provision); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) (cocaine powder provision); U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a72D1.1(a)(3). Since their enactment, these sentencing provisions have been attacked on the ground\n\nthat the sentencing disparity violates the Equal Protection Clause because crack cocaine convictions\n\ntend to involve poor urban African-American defendants while powder cocaine use is more common\n\namong wealthier whites. The sentencing disparity, this argument goes, results in impermissible\n\n\n                                                   26\n\fracial discrimination by subjecting black defendants to stiffer penalties for similar offenses. The\n\nSupreme Court recently refused to review the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rejection of this argument and there\n\nis no reason for us to reconsider the issue here. See United States v. Sloan, 97 F.3d 1378 (11th Cir.\n\n1996) cert. denied, 117 S.Ct. 2459 (1997); see also United States v. Munoz-Realps, 21 F.3d 375\n\n(11th Cir. 1994). The various circuit courts agree that there are numerous legitimate and non race-\n\nrelated reasons why Congress may have included the distinction between cocaine base and cocaine\n\npowder, and it is not for the courts to interfere in that determination. See, e.g., United States v.\n\nJackson, 84 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing valid reasons for sentence disparity, such as crack\u2019s\n\ngreater concentration and intensity, the youth of its users and sellers, the low per-dose cost resulting\n\nin easy distribution, and the violence frequently correlated with the use and dealing of the drug);\n\nU.S. v. Williams, 982 F.2d 1209 (8th Cir. 1992) (same); U.S. v. Galloway, 951 F.2d 64 (5th Cir.\n\n1992) (same). These legitimate goals defeat challenges to the guidelines under the Equal Protection\n\nclause.\n\n\n\nVIII. Erroneous Crack Cocaine Jury Instruction\n\n          Before releasing the jury to deliberate, the district court judge charged the jury on crack\n\naddiction with the following statement:\n\n          Now from time to time you have heard that some of the defendants were addicted to\n          crack cocaine or other controlled substances. Mere addiction to crack cocaine or any\n          other controlled substance is not a defense to possession with intent to distribute\n          crack cocaine, or conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine.\n          However, if the defendant were under the influence of crack cocaine such that it\n          destroyed the ability to form the criminal intent required in each offense, then you\n          cannot convict the defendant of that offense.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\fAppellant Jody Moore argues that the last sentence of the jury instruction should have provided that\n\n\u201cif the defendant were addicted to crack cocaine,\u201d rather than \u201cunder the influence of crack cocaine.\u201d\n\nDefendant argues that the use of the latter phrase was confusing to the jury and laid out an incorrect\n\nstandard under 21 U.S. C. \u00a7802(1), which defines an \u201caddict\u201d as\n\n         [a]ny individual who habitually uses any narcotic drug . . . who is so far addicted to\n         the use of narcotic drugs as to have lost the power of self control with reference to\n         his addiction.\n\n         Where a defendant\u2019s ability to form the specific intent to commit a crime is at issue, it is\n\nappropriate to examine only evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s specific state of mind at the time\n\nof the charged offense. U.S. v. Cameron, 907 F.2d 1051, 1067 (11th Cir. 1990). The record here\n\nreveals that the trial court opted to use the phrase \u201cunder the influence\u201d of cocaine because it wanted\n\nto make clear to the jury that a finding that a particular defendant was an addict did not permit the\n\njury to automatically conclude that he or she would have been unable to form the specific intent\n\nnecessary to engage in the conspiracy. Thus, the trial judge\u2019s instruction in this case was designed\n\nto appropriately narrow the jury\u2019s focus and we consequently conclude that its use did not constitute\n\nerror.\n\n         AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                                          PUBLISH\n                        IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                               FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                       __________\n                                                                    FILED\n                                      No. 94-6652            U.S. COURT OF APPEALS\n                                      __________               ELEVENTH CIRCUIT\n                                                                    3/01/99\n                             D.C.

Moran, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\n                                                       2\n\f                 FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       During 1989, as the result of several individual arrests for drug offenses, the Andalusia Police\n\nDepartment became aware of a large group of people engaged in the distribution of crack cocaine\n\nin Laurel Hill, Florida, along Ebenezer Road. The illegal drug transactions primarily took place in\n\nan area referred to as the \u201cQuarters,\u201d which consisted of two mobile home trailer parks, Rosa Mae\u2019s\n\nTrailer Park and Mary Lou\u2019s Trailer Park, and the abutting stretch of Ebenezer. The Andalusia\n\nPolice Department and the Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office engaged in a joint undercover\n\ninvestigation and discovered that the primary supplier for the area was Rosa Mae Smiley Williams,\n\nwho assumed that position after the arrest of another major dealer in the area, Chico Moore, and\n\nwhose trailer was used as a base of operations for the cocaine distribution efforts of various dealers\n\nas well as a storage place for narcotics, weapons and cash. From 1989 to 1993 the police carried out\n\nextensive video and audio surveillance, meticulously documented scores of drug transactions\n\ninvolving every person who was eventually indicted, and used informants to effect controlled\n\ntransactions. On December 9 and 10, 1993, local and federal law enforcement cooperated to arrest\n\nmany members of the conspiracy.\n\n       As a result of that investigation, and as amply supported by the evidence presented at trial,\n\nthe government concluded that Rosa Mae Smiley Williams, Chico Fernandez Moore and J.W. Moore\n\nobtained their supply of cocaine and cocaine base from unindicted sources in Marianna and Miami,\n\nFlorida, and elsewhere. Rosa Mae Williams and J.W. Moore were also supplied by Chico Moore.\n\nJ.W. Moore, Chico Moore and Rosa Mae Williams would distribute drugs among the remaining\n\ndefendants. Delacey Caldwell, who became a witness for the government at trial, was the \u201cmain\u201d\n\ndrug runner for Rosa Mae Williams. He would also carry weapons to protect himself, the drugs, and\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fothers members of the drug ring who worked with him. Claudell Smiley, Arlutha Smiley, and\n\nClennon Matthews also dealt substantial quantities of narcotics they bought from or were fronted by\n\nChico Moore, and Arlutha would on occasion use stolen property to buy drugs. James Buster Moore\n\nand Jody Moore bought drugs for redistribution from Chico Moore, Rosa Mae Williams, Claudell\n\nSmiley, Clennon Matthews and J.W. Moore, the \u201cmajor\u201ddealers. Most of the other defendants were\n\n\u201crunners\u201d who would buy small quantities of cocaine to both redistribute to individuals along\n\nEbenezer Road and use personally. They would either pay for these quantities with cash or the\n\ndealers would \u201cfront\u201d the cocaine to the runners, who then sold the drugs and returned the profits to\n\nthe dealer. In exchange for selling the cocaine, the runner would be allowed to keep a portion of the\n\nproceeds or a small piece of crack (sometimes referred to as a \u201cpiece\u201d or a \u201ccookie.\u201d)\n\n       On December 8, 1993, the United States filed an indictment in the District Court of the\n\nUnited States for the Middle District of Alabama, Northern District, charging twenty-seven co-\n\ndefendants with conspiring to distribute and possess cocaine and cocaine base in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7841(a)(1) and \u00a7846. Immediately prior to trial, several of the co-defendants pleaded guilty,\n\nincluding Rosa Mae Smiley Williams, Chico Fernandez Moore, Bridgett Chapple, Delacy Caldwell\n\nand Clennon Matthews. These defendants entered plea agreements with the United States Attorney\n\nwherein they agreed to provide complete and truthful information about the other members of the\n\ndrug trade in exchange for the prosecution\u2019s promise to request a downward departure at sentencing.\n\nArlutha Smiley and Clarence Smiley subsequently pleaded guilty as well, entering similar plea\n\nagreements. Pursuant to these agreements Rosa Mae Smiley Williams and her sons, Arlutha Smiley\n\nand Clarence Smiley, were interviewed about their knowledge of the drug trafficking activities of\n\nthe other co-conspirators, and, although they apparently gave truthful information about several of\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fthe defendants, they refused to implicate Claudell Smiley (also Rosa Mae\u2019s son). These interviews\n\nwere conducted by Captain Jerry Newton, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Louis V. Franklin and Terry F.\n\nMoorer, and Investigator Mike Stewart of Okaloosa County Florida.\n\n        On May 16, 1994, the trial began for the remaining defendants, including Francis Williams,\n\nJ.W. Moore, James Buster Moore, Jody Moore, William Thrash and Claudell Smiley, all of whom\n\nwere ultimately convicted. The evidence at trial consisted of the testimony of several of the\n\ndefendants\u2019 former co-conspirators, police informants and several of the police officers and sheriff\u2019s\n\ndepartment officials who had conducted the investigation of the Laurel Hill conspiracy. Chico\n\nMoore and Delacy Caldwell, originally both co-defendants, gave testimony implicating themselves\n\nand, between the two of them, every other defendant. Captain Jerry Newton and Sheriff\u2019s Deputy\n\nMike Stewart, who jointly investigated the crime, both testified at trial to witnessing the criminal acts\n\nof almost all of the defendants. In addition, Shirley Tanner, a former crack addict who regularly\n\nbought, or prostituted herself to obtain, crack cocaine from the Laurel Hill group, testified in\n\nexchange for help getting treatment for her addiction. After the trial Tanner was also given $1,000\n\nwhen her mother unexpectedly needed emergency surgery and Tanner had no other means of paying\n\nher expenses. There were numerous additional witnesses at trial.\n\n        The defendants discussed above have now filed appeals on various grounds. The sheer scope\n\nof this conspiracy and the vast amount of evidence admitted at trial make it impractical and\n\ninefficient to particularly discuss the facts relating to each defendant here. Rather, we will refer to\n\nspecific portions of the record as necessary to the resolution of the various grounds for appeal.\n\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED AND ANALYSIS\n\nI. Motions for New Trial\n\n\n                                                   5\n\f       On August 2, 1994, the prosecution was informed that Captain Jerry Newton, one of the\n\nofficers who had been heavily involved in the investigation of the Laurel Hill conspiracy, was the\n\nsubject of an internal investigation by his employer, the Andalusia Police Department. On\n\nNovember 14, 1994, Captain Newton\u2019s employment was terminated. On January 12, 1995, the\n\nUnited States sent a letter to the district court hearing the Laurel Hill case, informing it of Newton\u2019s\n\ntermination and outlining the charges against him, which were (1) the falsification of records\n\npertaining to the payment of confidential informants, ostensibly in other, unrelated cases; and (2)\n\nfalse statements made to Police Chief Jerry Williamson concerning witness fees and other\n\nreimbursements paid to Captain Newton in this case. The court set a hearing for February 16, 1995,\n\nwhich was continued until March 15-16, 1995, to allow further investigation of the matter. At the\n\nhearing, the court considered the various motions filed in response to the government\u2019s disclosure\n\nof Newton\u2019s improprieties. Among other matters, the court heard motions for a new trial from both\n\nthe tried and convicted defendants, as well as those who had pleaded guilty and sought either new\n\nsentencing hearings or the opportunity to revoke their pleas. In an order filed September 4, 1996, the\n\ncourt denied these motions and numerous appellants now contest that decision. We will not reverse\n\nthe trial court\u2019s ruling on this matter unless we find that it abused its discretion.

The government honored its plea agreement with Clennon Matthews, but\n\nrefused to move for a downward departure for Rosa Mae and Arlutha Smiley because the statements\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fthey made were not entirely truthful. Specifically, the latter defendants stated that they were\n\nunaware of the nature and extent of their son/brother\u2019s, Claudell Smiley\u2019s, involvement in the\n\nconspiracy, when other evidence clearly indicated that this was not true (interviews, Rosa Mae\n\nSmiley Williams, 3/25/94; Arlutha Smiley, 4/25/94 and 3/3l/94). On appeal, the three defendants\n\nclaim they are either entitled to a new sentencing hearing or to revoke their pleas altogether.\n\nClennon Matthews argues that he would not have pleaded guilty had he known about Captain Jerry\n\nNewton\u2019s corruption, and Rosa Mae Williams and Arlutha Smiley claim prejudice because Captain\n\nNewton participated in taking their statements, from which statements the prosecution concluded that\n\nthe defendants were not being completely truthful. Matthews, Williams and Smiley argue, in\n\nessence, that the prosecution was required to disclose Detective Newton\u2019s suspension under Brady\n\nv.

Relying on a Fifth Circuit opinion, the court further noted that\n\nthe defendants who pleaded guilty had, in doing so, waived their right to trial and consequently could\n\nnot seek a new one. See Williams v.

Nor do we\n\nneed to decide whether a suspension, like Detective Newton\u2019s suspension, is sufficiently material\n\nto mandate Brady disclosure. Even if we accept that a guilty plea does not waive a defendant\u2019s\n\nBrady claim, that Brady information learned by the prosecutors after the plea but before sentencing\n\nmust be disclosed, and that Detective Newton\u2019s suspension is material enough to require disclosure\n\nunder Brady, the defendants\u2019 arguments must still be rejected.\n\n       First, Clennon Matthews\u2019 plea and sentencing both occurred prior to August 2, 1994, the date\n\nupon which the prosecution acknowledges that it became aware of the disciplinary investigation of\n\nDetective Newton. Matthews does not argue that the police department\u2019s knowledge of the\n\ninvestigation was imputed to the prosecution prior to this date, and he has not otherwise shown that\n\nthe prosecution knew of the investigation at either the time of his plea or his sentencing. Moreover,\n\nthere is no indication in Clennon Matthews\u2019 sentencing record1 that the court relied on Officer\n\nNewton\u2019s testimony or his role in the investigation. Rather, the transcript reveals that the\n\ngovernment\u2019s evidence against Matthews consisted primarily of statements by Chico Moore, Shirley\n\nTanner and Deputy Michael Stewart. Accordingly, there is no reason to believe that a disclosure of\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       The transcript of Clennon Matthews\u2019 sentencing hearing, dated July 13, 1994, before Judge\nIra DeMent, can be found at Volume 27 of the trial record.\n                                                 8\n\fthe police department\u2019s investigation of Officer Newton would have affected Matthew\u2019s decision\n\nto plea.\n\n           Similarly, Rosa Mae Williams and Arlutha Smiley pleaded guilty on March 14 and April 21,\n\n1994, months before the government was made aware of the Newton information.               Thus, the\n\ngovernment\u2019s obligation to disclose, if any, had not arisen. Unlike Matthews, however, Williams\n\nand Smiley were sentenced October 19 and October 20, 1994. In essence, these appellants argue that\n\nthey are entitled to a new sentencing hearing because, if it had been made aware of Newton\u2019s\n\ndishonesty, the sentencing court would have been less likely to honor the prosecution\u2019s request that\n\ntheir plea agreements be disregarded on the ground that Williams and Smiley had failed to provide\n\ntruthful statements about the activities of other members of the conspiracy, particularly Claudell\n\nSmiley.\n\n           We disagree. Even if we continue to assume that Williams and Smiley can raise a Brady\n\nclaim after pleading guilty, that Brady information learned by the prosecution after the plea must be\n\ndisclosed, and that Brady would require disclosing Detective Newton\u2019s suspension, the alleged error\n\nis harmless. Had the internal investigation been disclosed, it is unlikely that the government would\n\nhave used Newton at sentencing. Even without considering Newton\u2019s testimony, however, the\n\ntranscript contains overwhelming evidence implicating both Arlutha Smiley and Rosa Mae Williams\n\nin the conspiracy and indicating that they would have been aware of Claudell Smiley\u2019s involvement.2\n\nFurther, Captain Newton\u2019s involvement in every aspect of the events relevant to the pleas and\n\nsentencing is independently corroborated by other evidence. The transcripts indicate that Okaloosa\n\n\n\n           2\n         Such evidence is detailed infra in Section VI, where appellants\u2019 sentencing claims are\naddressed, and we consequently need not review the supporting facts here.\n                                                  9\n\fCounty Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Stewart was present at both interviews of Arlutha Smiley, on March 31 and\n\nApril 25, 1994. And the interview of Rosa Mae Williams, who was apparently interviewed by\n\nNewton alone and thus presents the most obvious point at which he could have influenced or\n\nmisrepresented the content of her statement, was recorded and transcribed. The trial record indicates\n\nthat the sentencing judge was presented with the transcripts of these interviews and had the\n\nopportunity to independently assess what the witnesses said. Moreover, between the trial and the\n\nhearing, the court considered the testimony of numerous witnesses who contradicted the statements\n\nArlutha and Rosa Mae made about their relationship with Claudell, among others. For these reasons,\n\ninformation about the police department\u2019s internal investigation of Captain Newton\u2019s dishonest\n\nconduct does not warrant a revocation of their pleas or new sentencing hearings.\n\n        With respect to the defendants found guilty at trial, we find for the same reasons that it is not\n\nreasonably probable that a disclosure of the information at issue would have changed the outcome\n\nof the trial or the sentences of those convicted. As with the pleas discussed above, at the time of trial\n\nthe government was unaware that Newton was the subject of investigation. Moreover, any testimony\n\nprovided by Newton was corroborated, often by multiple witnesses. Even if we disregard Newton\u2019s\n\ntestimony entirely, the testimony of Shirley Tanner, Delacey Caldwell and Chico Moore provides\n\nample evidence upon which the jury could have based its decision to convict. We accordingly\n\nconclude that the internal investigation of Officer Newton was not material under the Supreme\n\nCourt\u2019s Brady decision.\n\nII. Exclusion of Shirley Tanner\u2019s Arrest\n\n        One of the government\u2019s chief witnesses at trial was Shirley Tanner, a drug addict who\n\ncooperated with the police during the conspiracy investigation and participated in controlled\n\n\n                                                   10\n\fundercover drug buys from almost all of the defendants. When questioned about her motives for\n\ntestifying, Tanner stated that she cooperated with the government because they promised to put her\n\nin a drug rehabilitation program and help her get her life back together. At trial defendants sought\n\nto admit Covington County docket sheets indicating that at one time Tanner had been arrested for\n\nthe unauthorized use of a vehicle.     Relying on Federal Rules of Evidence 405(b) and 608(b),\n\ndefendants intended to use such evidence to show that the charges against Tanner were dropped in\n\nexchange for her cooperation in the conspiracy case and that was her true motive for testifying.\n\nDefendants\u2019 attorneys, however, were unable to show any connection between the government\u2019s\n\nprevious failure to bring charges on the matter of the unauthorized use of a vehicle and Tanner\u2019s\n\nparticipation in the conspiracy case (Rec.17:1184). Moreover, both Tanner and the prosecution\n\nmaintained (and offered proof) that the docket sheets were in error and that Tanner was never\n\ncharged in relation to the crime, which they claimed had arisen from a misunderstanding with the\n\nowner of the vehicle and was for that reason dropped. The trial judge allowed the defense to\n\nextensively question Tanner about the unauthorized-use accusations and her role in taking the\n\nvehicle, but once Tanner had specifically denied that she was arrested, the court refused to let the\n\ndefense question her further about whether she was arrested or admit documentary evidence to that\n\neffect. (Rec.17:1180-92).\n\n       Federal Rule of Evidence 405 generally prohibits the use of specific prior acts as proof of\n\ncharacter to show action in conformity with a character trait evidenced by the behavior. Evidence\n\nof prior conduct may, however, be used as circumstantial evidence of a non-character issue, such as\n\nmotive, intent, opportunity, knowledge, or other issues material to the charge.

Even if we assume that questions\n\nabout the misconduct itself were permissible as bearing on her credibility, Rule 608 specifically\n\nprohibits extrinsic proof of such acts and consequently the district court properly excluded the docket\n\nsheets purporting to detail the arrest. Because the government claimed that the arrest had never taken\n\nplace and the docket sheets were in error, and because defendants\u2019 theory that the charges had been\n\nbrought and dropped in exchange for Tanner\u2019s cooperation were speculative and unsupported by any\n\nevidence, the district court also had the discretion to prohibit further questions about the alleged\n\narrest until defendants could find support for their theory.

We disagree with appellants and find the situation before us\n\ndistinguishable from Kotteakos.\n\n       At trial, Delacey Caldwell testified that he frequently sold cocaine on Ebenezer Road, the\n\nstreet running through Laurel Hill, where most of the individual drug sales took place. He stated that\n\nJ.W. Moore, Buster Moore, Claudell Smiley and Rosa Mae Smiley would frequently buy cocaine\n\nfrom an outside supplier named Luis. These four (who, in addition to Chico Moore, the prosecution\n\nrefers to as the \u201cmajor players\u201d in the drug distribution ring) would then sell to the other defendants,\n\nincluding Delacey Caldwell, who would then deal the drugs on the street to individual buyers\n\n(Rec.20:1830). Thus, when Delacey Caldwell went to deal drugs he would first buy a quantity from\n\nRosa Mae or Claudell, or, if neither had a supply, from J.W. or Buster Moore (Rec.20-1831). To\n\nassist the sales, while there were dealers on the street Rosa Mae Smiley would monitor a police\n\nscanner that she kept in her trailer and, when she received notice of police presence in the Laurel Hill\n\narea, would come out and notify the dealers, who would then temporarily get off the street (Rec.20-\n\n1832). Similarly, Chico Moore testified that before he was arrested he would supply drugs to various\n\nmembers of the conspiracy and gave testimony that specifically indicates the members of the\n\nconspiracy were working in conjunction with him and others to achieve a common goal of\n\npurchasing and distributing drugs. For example, he testified that on at least one occasion he spoke\n\nwith his cousins Jody and Buster Moore about arranging for a drug purchase in another town, Fort\n\nWatson, and that at other times he had bought and sold cocaine both with Buster Moore and Thrash\n\nWilliams (Rec.22-2329-30, 2356). He also testified that he had previously lived with Francis\n\nWilliams, during which time Claudell Smiley would come to their house to purchase cocaine, and\n\ndiscussed transactions with Rosa Mae Smiley (Rec.22-2346, 2371). The remainder of the record is\n\n\n                                                  14\n\freplete with testimony connecting the various defendants to one another in their distribution efforts.\n\nViewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the government, the jury could reasonably have\n\nconcluded that the defendants were interconnected in a complex but single scheme to distribute\n\ncocaine in the Laurel Hill area. A reasonable trier of fact could find that all of the defendants were\n\nmutually interested and involved participants in an open Laurel Hill drug market. See United States\n\nv.

Proof of a Single Conspiracy\n\n        Appellants William Thrash, James Buster Moore, Francis Williams and Jody Moore next\n\ncontend that insufficient evidence was presented to prove their involvement in a single large-scale\n\nconspiracy. To sustain a conviction for conspiring to distribute narcotics the government must prove\n\nthat 1) an agreement existed between two or more persons to distribute the drugs; 2) that the\n\ndefendant at issue knew of the conspiratorial goal; and 3) that he knowingly joined or participated\n\nin the illegal venture.

The evidence discussed above is sufficient basis from which the jury could\n\nhave concluded that all three of these prongs were met and defendants were consequently guilty of\n\nparticipating in a single distribution conspiracy.\n\nV. Venue\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f       Appellants James Moore, William Thrash, Francis Williams and Jody Moore next claim that\n\nthe district court for the Middle District of Alabama was an improper venue in which to hold the\n\ntrial. They argue first that the government erroneously relied on Chico Moore\u2019s testimony, in which\n\nhe stated that he made numerous cocaine buys in Alabama, in determining the geographical\n\nboundaries of the conspiracy. Appellants base this argument on their now discredited claim that the\n\ngovernment failed to prove a single conspiracy involving all defendants and consequently venue\n\nmust be determined with respect to each individual conspiracy, considering only the locale of the\n\nacts constituting that particular crime. Defendants further argue that in determining proper venue\n\nthe district court should not have considered the May 27, 1993 arrest of Willie Sconiers in Andalusia,\n\nAlabama, because he was subsequently acquitted. We find this latter argument to be without merit.\n\n       \u201cThis Court reviews a challenge to venue in the light most favorable to the government, and\n\nmakes all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jury verdict when deciding\n\nwhether the government has proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that an offense has\n\noccurred in the trial district.\u201d United States v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551541\"><a href=\"/opinion/551541/united-states-v-oscar-smith-regina-smith-and-gary-king-julia-thom/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1551</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1557 (11th Cir. 1990). Title\n\n18 of the United States Code, governing the jurisdiction and venue of the federal courts, provides\n\nthat \u201cany offense begun in one district and completed in another, or committed in more than one\n\ndistrict, may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district in which such offense was begun,\n\ncontinued, or completed.\u201d 18 U.S.C. 3237(a). Where a conspiracy is concerned, venue is thus\n\nproper in any district where \u201can overt act\u201d was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Smith,\n\n918 F.2d at 1557. The overt act need not be committed by a defendant in the case; the acts of\n\naccomplices and unindicted co-conspirators can also expose the defendant to jurisdiction. See\n\nUnited States v.

The defendants do not dispute that Chico Moore\u2019s\n\ntestimony established that he and other defendants engaged in numerous overt acts in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy in the geographic area encompassing the Middle District of Alabama. Nor do they\n\ndispute, as the district court observed, that several other witnesses, including Shirley Tanner, Timmy\n\nBarlow, Delacey Caldwell, Sylvia Matthews, Mike Stewart and Tony Harrison, provided similar\n\ntestimony. For example, Sylvia Matthews testified that Chico Moore and J.W. Moore would come\n\nto her home in Andalusia, Alabama, to sell her cocaine. Having established a single conspiracy, the\n\ngovernment only had to show that one co-conspirator took such acts within the district court\u2019s venue\n\nwhich, in light of the testimony presented at trial, we find it did.3\n\nVI. Claims Based on the Sentencing Guidelines\n\n       The defendants attack their sentences on various grounds. We observe at the outset that we\n\nwill not disturb the district court\u2019s determination on these matters unless its decision was clearly\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The testimony discussed in this section is alone sufficient to establish venue in the Middle\nDistrict of Alabama, and we consequently need not discuss appellants\u2019 argument that in determining\nvenue the district court should not have considered the arrest of Willie Sconiers in Andalusia,\nAlabama. We note, however, that the acquittal of a co-defendant is a reflection only of a lack of\nproof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and is thus analytically distinct from the determination\nof whether the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the acquitted party acted\nin furtherance of the conspiracy in a particular geographic location.

At sentencing, the government called Chico Moore, who testified\n\nthat during the two-year period (1991-1993) that Buster was a member of the conspiracy Moore had\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fsold between one-half and one kilogram of cocaine to Buster (Rec.40:6-9); that Buster and his\n\nbrother had been arrested in possession of at least 54 grams (Rec.40:12); and that Buster regularly\n\nsold $50 rocks (or \u201ccookies\u201d) to at least four runners.4 Delacey Caldwell, a former crack addict who\n\nwas indicted and charged with being part of the Laurel Hill conspiracy, also testified that between\n\n1992 and 1993 he bought between two and three ounces of crack from Buster (Rec.40:42-3); that he\n\nhad witnessed Buster buy one or two ounces from Claudell Smiley (Rec.40:45); and that he knew\n\nof five or six other runners who regularly purchased from Buster as well (Rec.40:43). In addition,\n\nseveral of the witnesses at trial testified that they had either witnessed or participated in several more\n\ntransactions with Buster Moore. In light of this evidence, the district court\u2019s determination that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s base offense level should be predicated on transactions totaling 1.5 to 5 kilograms of\n\ncrack cocaine was not clearly erroneous.\n\n        The remaining three defendants contesting their base sentences, William Thrash, Jody Moore\n\nand Francis Williams, were each assigned a base cocaine level of between 500 milligrams and 1.5\n\nkilograms. The sentencing court did not err in setting these levels. For four to six months during\n\n1991, Jody Moore began buying cocaine from his cousin Chico Moore, who estimated that he sold\n\nJody a total of one-quarter kilogram during that period (Rec.42:18-9). In addition, Chico testified\n\nthat Jody accompanied him on several purchasing trips outside of Laurel Hill, where they bought a\n\n\n\n\n        4\n          As do several other appellants, Buster insists that Chico Moore was not part of the Laurel\nHill conspiracy and consequently argues that the district court should not have considered\ntransactions involving Chico in determining the base offense level. There is clearly no merit to this\nargument. Chico Moore was one of the twenty-seven defendants charged in this case and has\npleaded guilty to the conspiracy to possess and distribute charges. We have upheld the verdict of\na single conspiracy in which Moore was a co-conspirator. Thus, their joint drug activities clearly\nconstitute acts in furtherance of the conspiracy under \u00a71B1.3(a)(1)(B).\n                                                   19\n\ftotal of approximately 20 ounces, or approximately 560 grams. Id. This testimony alone establishes\n\nthat Jody Moore was involved with a minimum of 500 milligrams of cocaine.\n\n       Similarly, Francis Williams\u2019 participation in various drug buys with Chico Moore likewise\n\nputs her well over the 500 milligram mark. The evidence establishes that she and Chico lived\n\ntogether and that he regularly sold cocaine out of their home, often with her present and assisting,\n\nin sales totaling at least a half kilogram (Rec.22:2361-2). Additionally, she went on several\n\npurchasing trips with Chico, on at least one of which he bought a full kilogram and Williams assisted\n\nby folding the money. (Rec.37:21).\n\n       Finally, William Thrash argues that in sentencing him the trial court erred when it relied not\n\non his own conduct but on conduct of his co-conspirators, particularly Chico Moore. We disagree.\n\nThe evidence shows that during 1993 (the only year of the conspiracy that Thrash lived in Laurel\n\nHill), he dealt repeatedly with Chico Moore; took Chico on a 22-gram buy from Thrash\u2019s regular\n\nsources (Rec.22:2350-51); was fronted between a half- and a quarter-ounce of cocaine by Chico on\n\nnumerous occasions (Rec.22:2351-53); regularly sold the fronted cocaine in Laurel Hill\n\n(Rec.22:2351); traveled to Crestview with Chico to make a $1,600 purchase (Rec.22:2355-56); and\n\nto Pensacola to buy 2 ounces for $2,000 from one of Chico\u2019s sources. At this level of involvement\n\nit was evident to William Thrash that Chico Moore was a major drug supplier in the Laurel Hill area,\n\nand his buys and sells in this capacity were reasonably foreseeable to Thrash and clearly in\n\nfurtherance of the cocaine distribution conspiracy.\n\n       B. Firearm Enhancement\n\n       Defendants Arlutha Smiley, Clennon Matthews and Jody Moore argue that the district court\n\nerred in enhancing their sentence classification under U.S.S.G. \u00a72D1.1(b)(1), which provides for a\n\n\n                                                 20\n\ftwo-point increase in drug trafficking cases where the defendant possessed a firearm. A defendant\u2019s\n\nsentence may also be enhanced for possession by a co-conspirator if (1) the actual possessor is\n\ncharged as a co-conspirator; (2) the co-conspirator possessed the firearm in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy; and (3) the defendant who receives the enhancement was involved in the conspiracy at\n\nthe time of the possession.

These facts do not, however, distinguish him significantly from the rest of the general\n\npopulation and the district court did not err in denying this departure.\n\n        D. Minor or Minimal Participant\n\n        Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, the sentencing court must reduce a defendant\u2019s offense level by four\n\nlevels if it determines that the defendant was a \u201cminimal\u201d participant in the convicted offense,\n\nU.S.S.G. \u00a73B1.2(a), or by two levels if the defendant was a \u201cminor\u201d participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a73B1.2(b).\n\nA \u201cminimal participant\u201d is any conspiracy defendant who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of\n\nthose involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a73B1.2, Application note 1. A \u201cminor\n\nparticipant\u201d is any defendant who is \u201cless culpable than most other participants, but [his] role could\n\nnot be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a73B1.2, Application note 3. The application note further\n\nprovides:\n\n        It is intended that the downward adjustment for a minimal participant will be used\n        infrequently. It would be appropriate, for example, for someone who played no other\n        role in a very large drug smuggling operation than to off load part of a single\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f       marihuana shipment, or in a case where an individual was recruited as a courier for\n       a single smuggling transaction involving a small shipment of drugs.\n\nId. at notes 2 and 3.

They contend, however, that the district court should have classified them as minimal\n\nparticipants under \u00a73B1.2(b) and granted them an additional two-level downward departure. We\n\ndisagree. As discussed above, although Francis Williams undertook few, if any, independent drug\n\ntransactions, she was heavily involved in Chico Moore\u2019s regular Laurel Hill deals and cocaine\n\npurchasing trips outside of the area. With respect to Buster Moore\u2019s claim, Delacey Caldwell\n\ntestified that Moore sold him, and at least five other persons, cocaine for personal use and\n\nredistribution over a two-year period (Rec.40:41-42). In light of both Williams\u2019 and Caldwell\u2019s\n\nextensive involvement in numerous transactions, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred\n\nin refusing to classify them as minimal participants.\n\n       Jody Moore claims that he is entitled to classification as a minor participant because his\n\ninvolvement was primarily for personal use instead of distribution. As previously discussed,\n\nhowever, the evidence establishes that he accompanied his cousin Chico Moore on numerous\n\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fsubstantial cocaine purchases and consequently we find that the district court did not err in finding\n\nthat he was not among the less culpable of defendants.\n\n       E. Supervisory Role\n\n       Clennon Matthews argues that the district court erred in increasing his sentence level by three\n\npoints for being a manager or supervisor of at least one other person in a criminal organization that\n\ninvolved five or more participants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1(b) and Application note 2. Among other\n\nfactors, the sentencing court should consider the nature of defendant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy\n\nas well as his use and recruitment of other members. Id. at note 4. In a drug distribution case such\n\nas this one, the management enhancement is appropriate for a defendant who arranges drug\n\ntransactions, negotiates sales with others, and hires others to work for the conspiracy.

Matthews does not dispute that the evidence at trial established that he fronted or\n\ndirectly sold cocaine to numerous \u201crunners\u201d who would then sell the drug to buyers along Ebenezer\n\nroad, giving Matthews the resulting profit (Rec.27:18-9). In exchange for this service the runners\n\nwould generally be entitled to a small amount of cocaine for their own personal use. This undisputed\n\nactivity was sufficient to justify the sentencing court\u2019s enhancement under \u00a73B1.1(b).\n\n       F. Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n       Claudell Smiley and Clennon Matthews argue that the district court erred in denying their\n\nrequest for a two-point decrease under U.S.S.G. \u00a73E1.1, which permits the decrease if the defendant\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f\u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d Another point may be subtracted\n\nif defendant shows that he provided timely information about his involvement or gave the\n\nprosecution timely notice of his intent to plead guilty. We have observed that \u201c[t]he district court\n\nis in a unique position to evaluate whether a particular defendant has truly accepted the\n\nresponsibility for his actions.\u201d U.S. v.

The guidelines provide that the\n\nsentencing judge must consider all relevant information, including whether the defendant has\n\nvoluntarily terminated the criminal conduct. See also United States v. De La Rosa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553440\"><a href=\"/opinion/553440/united-states-of-america-cross-appellant-v-luis-fernando-de-la-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n680 (11th Cir. 1991). Matthew\u2019s continued use of illegal drugs constitutes in part a continuation of\n\nthe offense for which he was indicted and the district court\u2019s denial of the decrease was consequently\n\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\n       Claudell Smiley argues that he is entitled to a decrease in his sentence because although he\n\ndid not cooperate prior to trial or testify, after his conviction he agreed to give a statement to the\n\ngovernment for use in later prosecutions of additional members of the drug trade. In exchange for\n\nthis cooperation, the prosecution recommended a five-point downward departure which the district\n\ncourt accepted at sentencing. Claudell maintains that his cooperation entitles him to an additional\n\ntwo-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. We disagree.\n\n       Although a defendant\u2019s failure to plead guilty does not automatically preclude a reduction\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility, only in rare situations will a defendant who is convicted at a trial\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fbe entitled to the decrease. U.S.S.G. \u00a73E1.1, Application Note 2. The adjustment \u201cis not intended\n\nto apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial . . . is convicted, and\n\nonly then admits guilt.\u201d Id. There are rare circumstances in which the reduction is allowed for a\n\ntried and convicted defendant, such as where he went to trial only to assert and preserve\n\nconstitutional and other issues that do not relate to factual guilt. Id. Even then, however, the district\n\ncourt\u2019s determination of whether to grant the reduction should be \u201cbased primarily upon pre-trial\n\nstatements and conduct.\u201d Id. Claudell Smiley did not cooperate with the government during the\n\ninvestigation and forced the prosecution to seek a conviction by trial. Particularly in light of the\n\nfive-point downward departure that he has already been granted in exchange for his post-trial\n\ncooperation, the district court did not clearly err in denying the additional reduction.\n\nVII. Constitutionality of Crack Cocaine Sentencing Guidelines\n\n        Under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7841 and 846, and the corresponding sentence enhancement provisions\n\nat U.S.S.G. \u00a72D1.1, an individual convicted of dealing or possessing crack cocaine (an intense form\n\nof cocaine base) is subject to longer sentences than a person convicted of dealing or possessing the\n\nsame amount of powdered cocaine. Specifically, crimes involving 50 grams or more of cocaine base\n\n(crack) are subject to the same 10 years minimum sentence as crimes involving 5,000 grams of\n\ncocaine powder (commonly known as the \u201c100 to 1 ratio\u201d). See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(iii)\n\n(cocaine base provision); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7841(b)(1)(A)(ii)(II) (cocaine powder provision); U.S.S.G.\n\n\u00a72D1.1(a)(3). Since their enactment, these sentencing provisions have been attacked on the ground\n\nthat the sentencing disparity violates the Equal Protection Clause because crack cocaine convictions\n\ntend to involve poor urban African-American defendants while powder cocaine use is more common\n\namong wealthier whites. The sentencing disparity, this argument goes, results in impermissible\n\n\n                                                   26\n\fracial discrimination by subjecting black defendants to stiffer penalties for similar offenses. The\n\nSupreme Court recently refused to review the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rejection of this argument and there\n\nis no reason for us to reconsider the issue here. See United States v.

Erroneous Crack Cocaine Jury Instruction\n\n          Before releasing the jury to deliberate, the district court judge charged the jury on crack\n\naddiction with the following statement:\n\n          Now from time to time you have heard that some of the defendants were addicted to\n          crack cocaine or other controlled substances. Mere addiction to crack cocaine or any\n          other controlled substance is not a defense to possession with intent to distribute\n          crack cocaine, or conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine.\n          However, if the defendant were under the influence of crack cocaine such that it\n          destroyed the ability to form the criminal intent required in each offense, then you\n          cannot convict the defendant of that offense.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\fAppellant Jody Moore argues that the last sentence of the jury instruction should have provided that\n\n\u201cif the defendant were addicted to crack cocaine,\u201d rather than \u201cunder the influence of crack cocaine.\u201d\n\nDefendant argues that the use of the latter phrase was confusing to the jury and laid out an incorrect\n\nstandard under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. \u00a7802(1), which defines an \u201caddict\u201d as\n\n         [a]ny individual who habitually uses any narcotic drug . . . who is so far addicted to\n         the use of narcotic drugs as to have lost the power of self control with reference to\n         his addiction.\n\n         Where a defendant\u2019s ability to form the specific intent to commit a crime is at issue, it is\n\nappropriate to examine only evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s specific state of mind at the time\n\nof the charged offense.

The record here\n\nreveals that the trial court opted to use the phrase \u201cunder the influence\u201d of cocaine because it wanted\n\nto make clear to the jury that a finding that a particular defendant was an addict did not permit the\n\njury to automatically conclude that he or she would have been unable to form the specific intent\n\nnecessary to engage in the conspiracy.
