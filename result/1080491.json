Johnson, appeals as of right from the Blount\n\nCounty Circuit Court\u2019s revocation of his probation. The defendant pled guilty to incest,\n\na Class C felony, and was sentenced as a Range I, standard offender to six years\n\nconfinement in the Department of Correction. The defendant was ordered to serve one\n\nhundred eighty days in the Blount County Jail with the remainder to be served on\n\nsupervised probation. He contends that the trial court erred by revoking his probation\n\nand sentencing him to incarceration. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n              The defendant was originally indicted for rape but pled guilty to incest. He\n\nwas originally sentenced to one year in the Blount County Jail followed by four years in\n\ncommunity corrections. On December 31, 1996, a warrant was issued for a violation of\n\ncommunity corrections, alleging that the defendant failed to meet with his community\n\ncorrections officer, used alcohol in violation of his community corrections agreement,\n\nfailed to attend sex offender group therapy, failed to pay fines and court costs, and\n\nfailed to pay supervision fines. At the revocation hearing on March 21, 1997, the trial\n\ncourt amended the judgment to five years in the Department of Correction and released\n\nthe defendant on appeal bond, conditioned upon the defendant\u2019s meeting the\n\nrequirements of the community corrections program. On July 26, 1997, another warrant\n\nfor a violation was issued.\n\n\n\n              This court vacated and remanded the defendant\u2019s original conviction in\n\norder for the indictment to be amended to reflect a charge of incest. State v. Jimmy D.\n\nJohnson, No. 03C01-9602-CC-00062, Blount County (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 16, 1997).\n\nThe indictment was amended, and the defendant pled guilty to the amended charge of\n\nincest. The trial court sentenced him to six years in the Department of Correction, with\n\none hundred eighty days to be served in jail and the remainder on probation.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f             On October 5, 1998, a warrant for violation of probation was issued,\n\nalleging various failures by the defendant to follow probation requirements. At the\n\nrevocation hearing, the defendant\u2019s probation officer, Mike Lane, testified that the\n\ndefendant\u2019s probation began on November 4, 1997. He testified that the defendant\n\nabided by the terms of his probation until September 1998 when the defendant failed to\n\nreport on three different occasions. Mr. Lane testified that the defendant also failed to\n\nreport to his sex offender counselor, wrote a worthless check for twenty-five dollars, and\n\nprovided deceptive answers regarding his participation in sex counseling during a\n\npolygraph examination.\n\n\n\n              Mr. Lane testified that the last contact he had with the defendant was on\n\nSeptember 17, 1998, when the defendant called to say that he had missed his\n\nappointments because he had been drinking and having \u201cwomen problems.\u201d Mr. Lane\n\ntestified that he instructed the defendant to report on September 24 in order for Mr.\n\nLane to help him with his problems but that the defendant did not keep the\n\nappointment. Mr. Lane testified that the defendant missed his follow-up appointment\n\non November 30, 1998. He said he then learned that the defendant had failed to report\n\na public intoxication charge from August 1998, and he filed a violation report.\n\n\n\n              The defendant testified that his main problem was drinking and that he\n\nstopped going to sex offender counseling because of his drinking. At the conclusion of\n\nthe hearing, the trial court summarized the defendant\u2019s lengthy history of prior offenses,\n\nincluding numerous public intoxication and driving under the influence convictions. The\n\ntrial court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and ordered that the defendant spend the\n\nremainder of his sentence in the custody of the Department of Correction, finding that:\n\n              Doing the best that you can do fighting alcoholism, you know,\n              I mean, that\u2019s \u2013 the best a person can do is the best a person\n              can do, and I\u2019m not being critical of that. But that\u2019s not the only\n              consideration. There are lots of alcoholics, Mr. Johnson, that\n              don\u2019t commit incest and that don\u2019t have six or seven DUI\u2019s.\n              You don\u2019t have to break the law to be an alcoholic and even be\n\n\n                                              3\n\f              drinking. Some people do, some people don\u2019t. And the bad\n              thing about that is, it\u2019s public safety and your safety. . . . .\n              What I\u2019m saying is that I can\u2019t take the risk anymore because\n              of this repeated behavior and how dangerous it is.\n\n\n\n              The defendant contends that the trial court erred by revoking his probation\n\nand sentencing him to incarceration. The state contends that the trial court properly\n\nrevoked the defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced him to incarceration.\n\n\n\n              The decision to revoke probation is within the discretion of the trial court.\n\nState v.

Furthermore, he has not demonstrated that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion by ordering him to serve his sentence in incarceration. The\n\ndefendant\u2019s lengthy criminal history, his inability to abide by the terms of an alternative\n\nsentence, and his admitted alcohol abuse support the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n              In consideration of the foregoing and the record as a whole, we affirm the\n\njudgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n                                          ________________________________\n                                          Joseph M.
