We granted appellant\u2019s petition for certiorari, posing the\n\nfollowing question to the parties: \u201cDid the Court of Appeals err when it affirmed\n\fappellant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to murder although her sole co-conspirator\n\nwas acquitted of conspiracy to murder by the jury before which they were\n\njointly tried?\u201d Because we answer the question in the negative, the judgment is\n\naffirmed.\n\n      1. The facts are set forth in Thornton v. State, supra, 331 Ga. App. at 191-\n\n194 as follows:\n\n             Construed to support the jury's verdict, the evidence shows\n      that sometime in the spring or summer of 2007, appellant, who was\n      married to the victim, Richard (\u201cShell\u201d) Thornton III, began having\n      an illicit relationship with her co-worker [Walter] Booth, who was\n      also married. Witnesses testified that Booth was protective and\n      jealous of appellant at work, made statements that Shell mistreated\n      appellant, and told co-workers that he would kill anyone who\n      \u201cmess[ed] with\u201d appellant. On one occasion, appellant asked a\n      co-worker to deliver a note to Booth that said \u201cI love you,\u201d and she\n      sent Booth numerous e-mails throughout the summer and into the\n      winter of 2007, expressing her love for Booth and her desire to be\n      with him. Appellant also frequently wrote of her hatred for her\n      husband, his mistreatment of her, and her desperate desire to have\n      him \u201cgone for good\u201d from her life, primarily so that she could spend\n      more time with Booth. She regularly entreated Booth to help her\n      \u201cout [of] this hell-hole,\u201d said she could not take it anymore and\n      wanted it over with, and in November 2007, reminded Booth that\n      he \u201cpromised it would be done before Thanksgiving.\u201d\n             Several weeks later, on the morning of December 14, 2007,\n      a sheriff's deputy who had been summoned to the house by\n      appellant found Shell dead in the bedroom he shared with appellant.\n      Georgia Bureau of Investigation (\u201cGBI\u201d) agents were primarily\n      responsible for conducting the investigation into the murder, and\n\n                                        2\n\fappellant and other family members were interviewed on the day of\nthe murder and on several subsequent occasions. Appellant told\ninvestigators that her daughter Kristin Eunice called her early that\nmorning and asked appellant to bring Eunice her driver's license at\nwork. Appellant said she woke her two teenage sons, Cole Richard\nShelley Thornton (\u201cCole\u201d) and Seth Eunice (\u201cSeth\u201d), so that they\ncould get ready for school and that she also spoke to Shell who\nasked her to make a bank deposit while she was out. Appellant told\ninvestigators she took the money to make the deposit and then left\nthe house to take Eunice her driver's license, make the bank deposit,\nand run some other errands. Appellant said she then stopped at her\nmother's house, which was located nearby.\n       Appellant told investigators that she returned home and that\nwhen she walked in the door, she immediately noticed a bowl of\nchange had been knocked over and that several guns were lying on\nthe floor. She told police that she started yelling for Shell, but then\nshe noticed that their bedroom door was open, which she said had\nbeen closed when she left that morning. Appellant said she became\nfrightened someone was in the house, so she left and went back to\nher mother's house. She told her mother to call police, but then\ndecided to drive to the home of a sheriff's deputy who lived nearby\nbecause she thought he would get to her house faster. The deputy\nreturned with her to the house, where he found Shell lying in the\nbedroom with several gunshot wounds to the head, at least one of\nwhich could have been fatal by itself.\n       Seth and Cole also testified about the events the morning of\nDecember 14, 2007. Cole testified that his mother woke him up\nearly and told him that she needed to take Eunice's license to her at\nwork, so he got up and showered and then woke up his brother. Seth\nand Cole testified they left the house between 7:10 and 7:30 that\nmorning and exited through a door in the carport, which was\ntypically kept unlocked and which they did not lock that morning.\nThey said that when they left, their parents' bedroom door was\nclosed, and they did not see or speak to Shell, whom they assumed\nwas still sleeping. Seth and Cole said that everything appeared to be\n\n                                  3\n\fin its usual location when they left, including the guns and the\nchange container.\n       Seth and Cole testified that they encountered their grandfather\nJulian \u201cDwayne\u201d Thornton about 200 to 300 yards from the house\nand that they briefly talked to him and then left to go to school.\nDwayne testified that after talking to the boys, he took some pipe\noff a trailer, which he said took about 15 to 30 minutes to\naccomplish.\n       Dwayne further testified that after he finished his project, he\ndrove to appellant's house to talk to her. He said he knocked on the\ndoor but no one answered, so he pushed the door open and went\ninside. He testified that he noticed a pile of change on the floor and\nguns lying on a quilt and that the bedroom door was open, but he\ncould not see if anyone was in the bed, which he said appeared\nmessy. Dwayne said he called out several times but did not get an\nanswer, so he closed the door and left the house. Dwayne also\ntestified that he did not hear any gunshots while he was working in\nthe area, but said that he doubted he would have heard them in any\nevent.\n       A GBI crime scene specialist testified that there were no signs\nof forced entry into the home and that with the exception of the\ncarport door, all the doors and windows were locked. Investigators\nfound a computer, which had the monitor still turned on, in the back\nof Shell's truck while they were searching the premises the morning\nof the crime. The computer was analyzed and appellant's e-mails to\nBooth were discovered. Appellant was interviewed again and\nadmitted that she and Booth e-mailed each other, but she said they\nonly sent each other jokes. She also denied that Booth and she had\na romantic relationship.\n       Booth was also interviewed, and he also denied having a\nromantic relationship with appellant and denied being at her house\non December 14, 2007. He told officers that he was supposed to go\nto work that day but he decided not to go. Instead, he said he\nstopped by a convenience store to buy coffee and then went to\nanother store and played video poker.\n\n                                  4\n\f            However, Booth's explanation of his whereabouts did not\n      check out, and police also discovered that he and appellant had\n      made numerous telephone calls to each other the morning of Shell's\n      death. Booth told police that he had called appellant to see if she\n      was going to work that day, but could not explain why there were\n      so many calls between them. Booth also told the investigators that\n      he never talked to appellant on the phone unless it was about work\n      and that he had never communicated with her by computer over the\n      Internet.\n            Investigators also learned that a neighbor saw a big truck with\n      \u201cdual\u201d wheels drive slowly down the road toward appellant's house\n      in the early morning hours on the day of the murder. Another\n      neighbor told investigators that he had driven by the house that\n      morning and that he had noticed fresh tire tracks from a big truck in\n      the area. Several of Booth's co-workers also testified that they had\n      seen Booth with a handgun in the months preceding the crime, and\n      one witness testified that a photograph of a gun police showed him\n      looked similar to the one Booth had in his possession two to three\n      weeks before Shell was killed.\n            Booth's house was searched during the course of the\n      investigation, and police seized two bottles of Trazodone, which is\n      a prescription anti-depressant that also is sometimes used as a sleep\n      aid, one of which was found in Booth's bedroom. Shell's blood was\n      tested for a variety of substances, and one of those tests revealed\n      that Shell had a therapeutic amount of Trazodone in his blood at the\n      time of his death. Shell's father testified that appellant told him that\n      Shell had taken one of his mother's sleeping pills the night before\n      he was killed, but he said he could not identify the name of the\n      sleeping pill that Shell supposedly took that night, and Shell's\n      physician testified that he had never prescribed Trazodone to Shell.\n\n\n      2. Relying on Smith v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1356351\"><a href=\"/opinion/1356351/smith-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (297 SE2d 273) (1982),\n\nappellant contends that her conviction for conspiracy cannot stand because her\n\n                                         5\n\fco-conspirator was acquitted by the same jury and same presentation of\n\nevidence. Citing only to secondary sources, this Court stated as dicta in Smith\n\nv. State,1 that\n\n       [i]n a joint trial of co-conspirators, a failure of proof as to one\n       conspirator would amount to a failure of proof as to both, the\n       evidence presented being identical. Co-conspirators, alleged to be\n       the only two parties to the conspiracy, may not receive different\n       verdicts when they are tried together. In such a situation, the\n       verdicts are inconsistent because they reach different results\n       regarding the existence of a conspiracy between these two parties\n       based on exactly the same evidence.\n\nPrior to 1986, Georgia adhered to the inconsistent verdict rule which did not\n\nallow such verdicts to stand in criminal cases. At first glance, Smith v. State\n\nmight seem like precedent supportive of appellant\u2019s position. However, four\n\nyears after we issued the opinion in Smith v. State, this Court unequivocally\n\nabolished the inconsistent verdict rule in Milam v. State, supra, 255 Ga. at 562.\n\nSee also Tepanca v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3) (771 SE2d 879) (2015). We did this\n\nto make Georgia law consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision\n\n\n\n       1\n         Smith v. State is distinguishable from the case at bar because the case involved co-\nconspirators who were tried separately in front of different juries. In that situation, this Court held\nthat the conviction of one co-conspirator was not invalidated by the acquittal of the other co-\nconspirator. See also Hubbard v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.

Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111286\"><a href=\"/opinion/111286/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (105 SCt 471, 83 LE2d 461) (1984). In\n\nUnited States v. Powell, the defendant was acquitted of conspiracy to distribute\n\ncocaine, but was convicted of some of the overt acts that facilitated the\n\nconspiracy. The Powell court concluded the inconsistency of the jury\u2019s verdicts\n\ndid not provide a basis to reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions. In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the court recognized that a jury has an \u201cunreviewable power\u201d to\n\nrender verdicts, including inconsistent verdicts, for \u201cimpermissible reasons.\u201d\n\n(Internal quotations omitted.) 469 U.S. at 63. Those reasons may include a\n\nmistake, compromise, or lenity. Id. at 65.\n\n      [W]here truly inconsistent verdicts have been reached, the most that\n      can be said ... is that the verdict shows that either in the acquittal or\n      the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but that\n      does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant's guilt.\n\n(Punctuation and citation omitted.) Id. at 64-65. Allowing a defendant to\n\nchallenge inconsistent verdicts would be prone to speculation and would require\n\ncourts to make impermissible inquiries into the jury\u2019s deliberation process.

The Powell court also reasoned that, in spite of its rejection of the\n\ninconsistent verdict rule, the defendant would still be protected from \u201cjuror\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\firrationality\u201d through the appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nId. at 67.\n\n       Since Milam, this Court has consistently echoed the rationales set forth in\n\nPowell, that it is not for the courts to inquire into the jury\u2019s deliberations \u201cfor\n\nany inconsistency between guilty and not guilty verdicts.\u201d Turner v.

State, supra. Now having\n\nconsidered the matter, we see no reason why Milam and its progeny would not\n\nbe applicable to this case. Here, the jury convicted appellant of conspiracy to\n\nmurder and acquitted her co-conspirator of same, but also found her co-\n\nconspirator guilty of the lesser crimes of making false statements. Given this\n\noutcome, it is plausible that the jury\u2019s decision constituted a mistake,\n\ncompromise or lenity, none of which warrant intruding into its deliberations.\n\nThis approach is consistent with federal cases which have followed Powell by\n\ndeclining to reverse the conspiracy conviction of a co-conspirator when the\n\nother co-conspirator has been acquitted by the same jury and under the same\n\nevidence. See United States v. Andrews, 850 F2d 1557, 1561 (11th Cir. 1988)\n\n(\u201cConsistent verdicts are unrequired in joint trials for conspiracy: where all but\n\n       3\n         See Guajardo, supra, 290 Ga. at 174 (\u201c[R]eversal of an inconsistent verdict may occur in the\nrare instance where, instead of being left to speculate as to the jury\u2019s deliberations, the appellate\nrecord makes transparent the jury\u2019s rationale.\u201d)\n\n                                                 9\n\fone of the charged conspirators are acquitted, the verdict against the one can\n\nstand.\u201d).

We granted appellant\u2019s petition for certiorari, posing the\n\nfollowing question to the parties: \u201cDid the Court of Appeals err when it affirmed\n\fappellant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to murder although her sole co-conspirator\n\nwas acquitted of conspiracy to murder by the jury before which they were\n\njointly tried?\u201d Because we answer the question in the negative, the judgment is\n\naffirmed.\n\n      1. The facts are set forth in Thornton v. State, supra, 331 Ga. App. at 191-\n\n194 as follows:\n\n             Construed to support the jury's verdict, the evidence shows\n      that sometime in the spring or summer of 2007, appellant, who was\n      married to the victim, Richard (\u201cShell\u201d) Thornton III, began having\n      an illicit relationship with her co-worker [Walter] Booth, who was\n      also married. Witnesses testified that Booth was protective and\n      jealous of appellant at work, made statements that Shell mistreated\n      appellant, and told co-workers that he would kill anyone who\n      \u201cmess[ed] with\u201d appellant. On one occasion, appellant asked a\n      co-worker to deliver a note to Booth that said \u201cI love you,\u201d and she\n      sent Booth numerous e-mails throughout the summer and into the\n      winter of 2007, expressing her love for Booth and her desire to be\n      with him. Appellant also frequently wrote of her hatred for her\n      husband, his mistreatment of her, and her desperate desire to have\n      him \u201cgone for good\u201d from her life, primarily so that she could spend\n      more time with Booth. She regularly entreated Booth to help her\n      \u201cout [of] this hell-hole,\u201d said she could not take it anymore and\n      wanted it over with, and in November 2007, reminded Booth that\n      he \u201cpromised it would be done before Thanksgiving.\u201d\n             Several weeks later, on the morning of December 14, 2007,\n      a sheriff's deputy who had been summoned to the house by\n      appellant found Shell dead in the bedroom he shared with appellant.\n      Georgia Bureau of Investigation (\u201cGBI\u201d) agents were primarily\n      responsible for conducting the investigation into the murder, and\n\n                                        2\n\fappellant and other family members were interviewed on the day of\nthe murder and on several subsequent occasions. Appellant told\ninvestigators that her daughter Kristin Eunice called her early that\nmorning and asked appellant to bring Eunice her driver's license at\nwork. Appellant said she woke her two teenage sons, Cole Richard\nShelley Thornton (\u201cCole\u201d) and Seth Eunice (\u201cSeth\u201d), so that they\ncould get ready for school and that she also spoke to Shell who\nasked her to make a bank deposit while she was out. Appellant told\ninvestigators she took the money to make the deposit and then left\nthe house to take Eunice her driver's license, make the bank deposit,\nand run some other errands. Appellant said she then stopped at her\nmother's house, which was located nearby.\n       Appellant told investigators that she returned home and that\nwhen she walked in the door, she immediately noticed a bowl of\nchange had been knocked over and that several guns were lying on\nthe floor. She told police that she started yelling for Shell, but then\nshe noticed that their bedroom door was open, which she said had\nbeen closed when she left that morning. Appellant said she became\nfrightened someone was in the house, so she left and went back to\nher mother's house. She told her mother to call police, but then\ndecided to drive to the home of a sheriff's deputy who lived nearby\nbecause she thought he would get to her house faster. The deputy\nreturned with her to the house, where he found Shell lying in the\nbedroom with several gunshot wounds to the head, at least one of\nwhich could have been fatal by itself.\n       Seth and Cole also testified about the events the morning of\nDecember 14, 2007. Cole testified that his mother woke him up\nearly and told him that she needed to take Eunice's license to her at\nwork, so he got up and showered and then woke up his brother. Seth\nand Cole testified they left the house between 7:10 and 7:30 that\nmorning and exited through a door in the carport, which was\ntypically kept unlocked and which they did not lock that morning.\nThey said that when they left, their parents' bedroom door was\nclosed, and they did not see or speak to Shell, whom they assumed\nwas still sleeping. Seth and Cole said that everything appeared to be\n\n                                  3\n\fin its usual location when they left, including the guns and the\nchange container.\n       Seth and Cole testified that they encountered their grandfather\nJulian \u201cDwayne\u201d Thornton about 200 to 300 yards from the house\nand that they briefly talked to him and then left to go to school.\nDwayne testified that after talking to the boys, he took some pipe\noff a trailer, which he said took about 15 to 30 minutes to\naccomplish.\n       Dwayne further testified that after he finished his project, he\ndrove to appellant's house to talk to her. He said he knocked on the\ndoor but no one answered, so he pushed the door open and went\ninside. He testified that he noticed a pile of change on the floor and\nguns lying on a quilt and that the bedroom door was open, but he\ncould not see if anyone was in the bed, which he said appeared\nmessy. Dwayne said he called out several times but did not get an\nanswer, so he closed the door and left the house. Dwayne also\ntestified that he did not hear any gunshots while he was working in\nthe area, but said that he doubted he would have heard them in any\nevent.\n       A GBI crime scene specialist testified that there were no signs\nof forced entry into the home and that with the exception of the\ncarport door, all the doors and windows were locked. Investigators\nfound a computer, which had the monitor still turned on, in the back\nof Shell's truck while they were searching the premises the morning\nof the crime. The computer was analyzed and appellant's e-mails to\nBooth were discovered. Appellant was interviewed again and\nadmitted that she and Booth e-mailed each other, but she said they\nonly sent each other jokes. She also denied that Booth and she had\na romantic relationship.\n       Booth was also interviewed, and he also denied having a\nromantic relationship with appellant and denied being at her house\non December 14, 2007. He told officers that he was supposed to go\nto work that day but he decided not to go. Instead, he said he\nstopped by a convenience store to buy coffee and then went to\nanother store and played video poker.\n\n                                  4\n\f            However, Booth's explanation of his whereabouts did not\n      check out, and police also discovered that he and appellant had\n      made numerous telephone calls to each other the morning of Shell's\n      death. Booth told police that he had called appellant to see if she\n      was going to work that day, but could not explain why there were\n      so many calls between them. Booth also told the investigators that\n      he never talked to appellant on the phone unless it was about work\n      and that he had never communicated with her by computer over the\n      Internet.\n            Investigators also learned that a neighbor saw a big truck with\n      \u201cdual\u201d wheels drive slowly down the road toward appellant's house\n      in the early morning hours on the day of the murder. Another\n      neighbor told investigators that he had driven by the house that\n      morning and that he had noticed fresh tire tracks from a big truck in\n      the area. Several of Booth's co-workers also testified that they had\n      seen Booth with a handgun in the months preceding the crime, and\n      one witness testified that a photograph of a gun police showed him\n      looked similar to the one Booth had in his possession two to three\n      weeks before Shell was killed.\n            Booth's house was searched during the course of the\n      investigation, and police seized two bottles of Trazodone, which is\n      a prescription anti-depressant that also is sometimes used as a sleep\n      aid, one of which was found in Booth's bedroom. Shell's blood was\n      tested for a variety of substances, and one of those tests revealed\n      that Shell had a therapeutic amount of Trazodone in his blood at the\n      time of his death. Shell's father testified that appellant told him that\n      Shell had taken one of his mother's sleeping pills the night before\n      he was killed, but he said he could not identify the name of the\n      sleeping pill that Shell supposedly took that night, and Shell's\n      physician testified that he had never prescribed Trazodone to Shell.\n\n\n      2. Relying on Smith v. State, 250 Ga. 264 (297 SE2d 273) (1982),\n\nappellant contends that her conviction for conspiracy cannot stand because her\n\n                                         5\n\fco-conspirator was acquitted by the same jury and same presentation of\n\nevidence. Citing only to secondary sources, this Court stated as dicta in Smith\n\nv. State,1 that\n\n       [i]n a joint trial of co-conspirators, a failure of proof as to one\n       conspirator would amount to a failure of proof as to both, the\n       evidence presented being identical. Co-conspirators, alleged to be\n       the only two parties to the conspiracy, may not receive different\n       verdicts when they are tried together. In such a situation, the\n       verdicts are inconsistent because they reach different results\n       regarding the existence of a conspiracy between these two parties\n       based on exactly the same evidence.\n\nPrior to 1986, Georgia adhered to the inconsistent verdict rule which did not\n\nallow such verdicts to stand in criminal cases. At first glance, Smith v. State\n\nmight seem like precedent supportive of appellant\u2019s position. However, four\n\nyears after we issued the opinion in Smith v. State, this Court unequivocally\n\nabolished the inconsistent verdict rule in Milam v. State, supra, 255 Ga. at 562.\n\nSee also Tepanca v. State, 297 Ga. 47 (3) (771 SE2d 879) (2015). We did this\n\nto make Georgia law consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision\n\n\n\n       1\n         Smith v. State is distinguishable from the case at bar because the case involved co-\nconspirators who were tried separately in front of different juries. In that situation, this Court held\nthat the conviction of one co-conspirator was not invalidated by the acquittal of the other co-\nconspirator. See also Hubbard v. State, 274 Ga. App. 639 (618 SE2d 690) (2005) (case involving\nco-conspirators who were tried separately).\n\n                                                  6\n\fin United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57 (105 SCt 471, 83 LE2d 461) (1984). In\n\nUnited States v. Powell, the defendant was acquitted of conspiracy to distribute\n\ncocaine, but was convicted of some of the overt acts that facilitated the\n\nconspiracy. The Powell court concluded the inconsistency of the jury\u2019s verdicts\n\ndid not provide a basis to reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions. In reaching this\n\nconclusion, the court recognized that a jury has an \u201cunreviewable power\u201d to\n\nrender verdicts, including inconsistent verdicts, for \u201cimpermissible reasons.\u201d\n\n(Internal quotations omitted.) 469 U.S. at 63. Those reasons may include a\n\nmistake, compromise, or lenity. Id. at 65.\n\n      [W]here truly inconsistent verdicts have been reached, the most that\n      can be said ... is that the verdict shows that either in the acquittal or\n      the conviction the jury did not speak their real conclusions, but that\n      does not show that they were not convinced of the defendant's guilt.\n\n(Punctuation and citation omitted.) Id. at 64-65. Allowing a defendant to\n\nchallenge inconsistent verdicts would be prone to speculation and would require\n\ncourts to make impermissible inquiries into the jury\u2019s deliberation process. Id.\n\nat 66. The Powell court also reasoned that, in spite of its rejection of the\n\ninconsistent verdict rule, the defendant would still be protected from \u201cjuror\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\firrationality\u201d through the appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nId. at 67.\n\n       Since Milam, this Court has consistently echoed the rationales set forth in\n\nPowell, that it is not for the courts to inquire into the jury\u2019s deliberations \u201cfor\n\nany inconsistency between guilty and not guilty verdicts.\u201d Turner v. State, 283\n\nGa. 17 (2) (655 SE2d 589) (2008).2 See also Dugger v. State, 297 Ga. 120 (4)\n\n(772 SE2d 695) (2015); Guajardo v. State, 290 Ga. 172 (2) (718 SE2d 292)\n\n(2011); King v. Waters, 278 Ga. 122 (1) (598 SE2d 476) (2004); Robles v.\n\nState, 277 Ga. 415 (1) (589 SE2d 566) (2003). As such, we have refused to\n\napply the inconsistent verdict rule not only in cases where a single defendant\n\nreceives inconsistent verdicts as to two or more charges (see, e.g., Coleman v.\n\nState, 286 Ga. 291 (4) (687 SE2d 427) (2009)), but also in cases where co-\n\ndefendants, who are tried together, receive inconsistent verdicts as to each other.\n\nSee Lucas v. State, 264 Ga. 840 (452 SE2d 110) (1995); Parker v. Mooneyham,\n\n256 Ga. 334 (349 SE2d 182) (1986), overruled on other grounds by State v.\n\nFreeman, 264 Ga. 276 (444 SE2d 80) (1994). There is only one very narrow\n\n       2\n        The Georgia Court of Appeals has also followed Milam. See, e.g., Muldrow v. State, 322\nGa. App. 190 (1) (744 SE2d 413) (2013); Jones v. State, 318 Ga. App. 105 (1) (733 SE2d 407)\n(2012); Kimble v. State, 236 Ga. App. 391 (1) (512 SE2d 306) (1999).\n\n                                              8\n\fexception to the rule against reversing inconsistent verdicts,3 but that exception\n\nis not raised or indicated here.\n\n       The instant case is one of first impression only inasmuch as it concerns\n\ninconsistent conspiracy verdicts between jointly-tried co-conspirators and as it\n\nconcerns the validity of the dicta in Smith v. State, supra. Now having\n\nconsidered the matter, we see no reason why Milam and its progeny would not\n\nbe applicable to this case. Here, the jury convicted appellant of conspiracy to\n\nmurder and acquitted her co-conspirator of same, but also found her co-\n\nconspirator guilty of the lesser crimes of making false statements. Given this\n\noutcome, it is plausible that the jury\u2019s decision constituted a mistake,\n\ncompromise or lenity, none of which warrant intruding into its deliberations.\n\nThis approach is consistent with federal cases which have followed Powell by\n\ndeclining to reverse the conspiracy conviction of a co-conspirator when the\n\nother co-conspirator has been acquitted by the same jury and under the same\n\nevidence. See United States v. Andrews, 850 F2d 1557, 1561 (11th Cir. 1988)\n\n(\u201cConsistent verdicts are unrequired in joint trials for conspiracy: where all but\n\n       3\n         See Guajardo, supra, 290 Ga. at 174 (\u201c[R]eversal of an inconsistent verdict may occur in the\nrare instance where, instead of being left to speculate as to the jury\u2019s deliberations, the appellate\nrecord makes transparent the jury\u2019s rationale.\u201d)\n\n                                                 9\n\fone of the charged conspirators are acquitted, the verdict against the one can\n\nstand.\u201d). See also United States v. Collins, 412 F3d 515 (III) (4th Cir. 2005)\n\n(refusing to overturn a conspiracy conviction merely because a co-conspirator\n\nwas acquitted by the same jury); United States v. Crayton, 357 F3d 560 (1) (A)\n\n(6th Cir. 2004) (Powell applies to cases concerning inconsistent verdicts\n\namongst co-conspirators); United States v. Acosta, 17 F3d 538 (II) (B) (2nd Cir.\n\n1994) (\u201cIn light of Powell, one defendant's conspiracy conviction does not\n\nbecome infirm by reason of jury verdicts of not guilty against all of his alleged\n\ncoconspirators.\u201d); United States v. Lopez, 944 F2d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 1991) (\u201c[A]s\n\na simple matter of logic, the government's voluntary dismissal of a conspiracy\n\ncharge against a defendant's only alleged coconspirator does not preclude proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, at defendant's trial, that the defendant conspired\n\nwith that same alleged coconspirator.\u201d); United States v. Valles\u2013Valencia, 823\n\nF2d 381, 382 (9th Cir. 1987) (\u201cthe acquittal of all conspirators but one does not\n\nnecessarily indicate that the jury found no agreement to act\u201d). Accordingly, the\n\ndicta in Smith v. State is disapproved inasmuch as it has been abrogated by\n\nMilam and its progeny.\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f      The evidence was otherwise sufficient to convict appellant of the crimes\n\nfor which she was charged. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (99 SCt 2781, 61\n\nLE2d 560) (1979). Therefore, the Court of Appeals did not err when it affirmed\n\nappellant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to murder.\n\n      Judgment affirmed. All the Justices concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                      11\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "b44a2fcfcacfd5d20e9c3b13682c46019f2f8442", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Supreme Court of Georgia", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/110138/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111286/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1245869/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1270818/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1356351/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1357039/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1385355/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2016-03-21T13:06:33.173735Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 11, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/3187171/thornton-v-state/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "3187118", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Thornton v.
