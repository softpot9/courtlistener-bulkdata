See N.J.\n\nStat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2A:53A-26 to -29. We will affirm.\n\n                                              I\n\n       Because we write for the parties, who are well acquainted with the case, we recite\n\nonly the essential facts and procedural history.\n\n       In 2009, David received a transplanted kidney from a donor who, prior to the\n\nsurgery, had tested positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV). David and his wife, Megan,\n\ntested negative for the virus. David could have received a kidney from Megan, but\n\nultimately chose the other donor so that Megan would be able to donate a kidney to their\n\nson if he someday needed it. Before he consented to the surgery, David had been told of\n\nthe serious risk of CMV infection associated with the transplant procedure, but not of the\n                                             2\n\fdifferent CMV test results. For more than two years following the transplant, David\n\nsuffered complications from a CMV infection, which ended with the removal of the\n\ntransplanted kidney. Megan also contracted CMV during this period.\n\n       David and Megan filed a diversity suit against Thomas Jefferson University\n\nHospital, Inc., where the transplant was performed, and against several medical\n\nprofessionals who were involved in transplanting the kidney and treating David\n\n(collectively, Defendants). The amended complaint alleges five counts\u2014lack of\n\ninformed consent, assault and battery, professional malpractice, negligence, and\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation\u2014but the Mulhollands abandoned all but the first and last\n\nclaims during the course of litigation in the District Court. The District Court dismissed\n\nthe complaint for failure to satisfy the affidavit-of-merit requirement, 1 and the\n\nMulhollands timely filed a notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n       1\n           The affidavit-of-merit statute provides in pertinent part:\n\n       In any action for damages for personal injuries, wrongful death or property\n       damage resulting from an alleged act of malpractice or negligence by a\n       licensed person in his profession or occupation, the plaintiff shall, within 60\n       days following the date of filing of the answer to the complaint by the\n       defendant, provide each defendant with an affidavit of an appropriate\n       licensed person that there exists a reasonable probability that the care, skill\n       or knowledge exercised or exhibited in the treatment, practice or work that\n       is the subject of the complaint, fell outside acceptable professional or\n       occupational standards or treatment practices. The court may grant no\n       more than one additional period, not to exceed 60 days, to file the affidavit\n       pursuant to this section, upon a finding of good cause.\n\n                                                3\n\f                                              II\n\n       We will affirm largely for the reasons stated by the District Court, whose decision\n\nwe subject to plenary review. Newell v. Ruiz, 286 F.3d 166, 167 n.2 (3d Cir. 2002). The\n\nMulhollands offer two arguments for reversal. First, they contend that under New Jersey\n\nlaw, an affidavit is not required to proceed with a lack-of-informed-consent or fraudulent-\n\nmisrepresentation claim. In the alternative, they assert that they substantially complied\n\nwith the affidavit requirement.\n\n       We squarely rejected the first argument in Chamberlain v. Giampapa, 210 F.3d\n\n154, 161\u201362 (3d Cir. 2000), holding that under New Jersey law, an affidavit is a\n\nnecessary predicate to a lack-of-informed-consent action. We are permitted to reconsider\n\nthis holding \u201c\u2018in light of intervening authority,\u2019 including intervening decisions of state\n\nlaw [by] its highest court.\u201d Covell v. Bell Sports, Inc., 651 F.3d 357, 364 (3d Cir. 2011)\n\n(quoting Reich v. D.M. Sabia Co., 90 F.3d 854, 858 (3d Cir. 1996)). The Mulhollands\n\n\n\n       In the case of an action for medical malpractice, the person executing the\n       affidavit shall meet the requirements of a person who provides expert\n       testimony or executes an affidavit as set forth in section 7 of P.L. 2004, c.\n       17 (C.2A:53A-41). In all other cases, the person executing the affidavit\n       shall be licensed in this or any other state; have particular expertise in the\n       general area or specialty involved in the action, as evidenced by board\n       certification or by devotion of the person\u2019s practice substantially to the\n       general area or specialty involved in the action for a period of at least five\n       years. The person shall have no financial interest in the outcome of the\n       case under review, but this prohibition shall not exclude the person from\n       being an expert witness in the case.\n\nN.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:53A-27.\n                                              4\n\fproffer a few New Jersey Supreme Court precedents addressing the affidavit requirement\n\nsince Chamberlain, see Couri v. Gardner, 801 A.2d 1134 (N.J. 2002); Palanque v.\n\nLambert-Woolley, 774 A.2d 501 (N.J. 2001); Hubbard ex rel. Hubbard v. Reed, 774 A.2d\n\n495 (N.J. 2001), but none of these cases considered the affidavit requirement as applied\n\nto a lack-of-informed-consent claim. Accordingly, Chamberlain controls our disposition\n\nhere. Because the evidence necessary to prove fraudulent misrepresentation in this case\n\nwould be nearly identical to that needed to show lack of informed consent, Chamberlain\n\nalso disposes of the Mulhollands\u2019 second cause of action.\n\n       As the Mulhollands were subject to the affidavit requirement, the only remaining\n\nquestion is whether they complied with it. They forthrightly concede that their affidavit\n\nwas untimely, and we agree with the District Court that their affiant, a family medicine\n\npractitioner, does not meet the expertise standard found in N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:53A-27.\n\nThe Mulhollands argue under the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s doctrine of \u201csubstantial\n\ncompliance\u201d that they should be excused from this failure. See Ferreira v. Rancocas\n\nOrthopedic Assocs., 836 A.2d 779, 783 (N.J. 2003) (discussing the five-part substantial-\n\ncompliance test). That Court has applied this doctrine where a medical-malpractice\n\ndefendant\u2019s name was omitted from the affidavit, which was otherwise \u201ctimely served\u201d\n\nand accompanied by \u201can extensive medical expert\u2019s report that clearly focused on his\n\nconduct and on the totality of the circumstances attending\u201d the alleged tort, Fink v.\n\nThompson, 772 A.2d 386, 394\u201395 (N.J. 2001), and in another case where \u201cplaintiff\u2019s\n\n                                             5\n\fcounsel obtained a detailed expert\u2019s report verifying the legitimacy of the claim long\n\nbefore filing the complaint, immediately shared it with defendant\u2019s carriers, and engaged\n\nin settlement discussions with defendants based on the report,\u201d Galik v. Clara Maass\n\nMed. Ctr., 771 A.2d 1141, 1152 (N.J. 2001). Unlike the plaintiffs in those cases, the\n\nMulhollands can show neither a lack of prejudice to Defendants, who may be held liable\n\nif we accept the substantial-compliance argument and who were not timely \u201cnotified . . .\n\nabout the merits of the . . . claims filed against them,\u201d Palanque, 774 A.2d at 506, nor a\n\nreasonable explanation for noncompliance. The District Court correctly held that the\n\nMulhollands did not substantially comply with the affidavit requirement. 2\n\n                                            III\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The Mulhollands also invoke the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d exception\nrecognized in Ferreira, 836 A.2d at 783, but because they address it for the first time in\ntheir reply brief, the argument has been waived. E.g., United States v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d\n197, 222 (3d Cir. 2005).\n                                             6\n\f", "ML_Tags": [], "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "Case_No": "11-3412", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                                NOT PRECEDENTIAL\n\n                     UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                          FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                               ____________\n\n                                       No. 11-3412\n                                      ____________\n\n      DAVID MULHOLLAND; MEGAN MULHOLLAND, Husband and Wife,\n\n                                                        Appellants\n\n                                           v.\n\n              THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, INC.;\n               THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY PHYSICIANS;\n               CATALDO DORIA, MD, individually; JEAN NOVAK,\n                   BSN, individually; JAMES F.

Because the evidence necessary to prove fraudulent misrepresentation in this case\n\nwould be nearly identical to that needed to show lack of informed consent, Chamberlain\n\nalso disposes of the Mulhollands\u2019 second cause of action.\n\n       As the Mulhollands were subject to the affidavit requirement, the only remaining\n\nquestion is whether they complied with it. They forthrightly concede that their affidavit\n\nwas untimely, and we agree with the District Court that their affiant, a family medicine\n\npractitioner, does not meet the expertise standard found in N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:53A-27.\n\nThe Mulhollands argue under the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s doctrine of \u201csubstantial\n\ncompliance\u201d that they should be excused from this failure.
