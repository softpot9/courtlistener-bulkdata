See 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.\n\n                                        Background\n\n       Mr. Smith was employed with the City as a firefighter. By 1989, Mr. Smith had\n\nattained the rank of assistant fire chief and had accrued over twenty years of service with\n\nthe City. As required by Oklahoma statute, the City was a participating municipality in\n\nthe System, and as an eligible full time firefighter, Mr. Smith was a participating member\n\nin the System. Under the System\u2019s statutory scheme, member firefighters with twenty or\n\nmore years of service are eligible to retire and receive a monthly service pension benefit.\n\n\n\n\n       The Enid Fire Department Civil Service Commission is not a party to this appeal.\n       1\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fAt any time, retired member firefighters receiving a pension benefit may serve as\n\nfirefighters for compensation within the state of Oklahoma; they may not, however,\n\ncontinue to receive pension benefits during such service.\n\n       In October 1988, Bob Hollander, Executive Director of the System, and Pete\n\nStavrose, the Legislative Director of the Oklahoma State Firefighters Association, held a\n\nmeeting at the Enid fire station to discuss proposed legislation for a deferred\n\ncompensation plan for Oklahoma firefighters. Mr. Smith attended this meeting, where it\n\nwas related that under the proposed legislation firefighters opting to participate in the plan\n\nwould be required to retire after a set number of years.\n\n       On April 24, 1989, a deferred compensation plan for Oklahoma firefighters was\n\nenacted into law. It provided, in pertinent part:\n\n        A.    In lieu of terminating employment and accepting a service retirement\n       pension . . . any member of [the System] who has not less than twenty (20) years\n       of creditable service and who is eligible to receive a service retirement pension\n       may elect to participate in the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option Plan and\n       defer the receipts of benefits in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n       ....\n\n       C.     The duration of participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option\n       Plan for active firefighters shall not exceed five (5) years.\n\n       D.     When a member begins participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred\n       Option Plan, the contribution of the employee shall cease. The employer\n       contributions shall continue to be paid . . . . Municipal contributions for\n       employees who elect the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option Plan shall be\n       credited equally to [the System] and to the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option\n       Plan. The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had the\n       member elected to cease employment and receive a service retirement shall be paid\n       into the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option Plan account.\n\n                                              3\n\f1989 Okla. Sess. Laws 240-41 (codified at Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 49-106.1 (West\n\nSupp.1998)). Mr. Smith received a copy of the newly enacted legislation in bill form,\n\nread it, and determined that it did not require him to retire after five years if he\n\nparticipated in the plan. Mr. Smith accordingly decided to opt into the plan, and on\n\nOctober 17, 1989, he drove to the System\u2019s offices in Oklahoma City and informed Bob\n\nHollander he wished to sign up for the Deferred Option Plan. Mr. Hollander provided\n\nMr. Smith with the form, and Mr. Smith signed it. The election form provided that\n\nparticipation in the plan was limited to five years and that Mr. Smith\u2019s deferred option\n\ndeposits would cease September 1, 1994. The election form did not explicitly provide\n\nthat Mr. Smith would be required to retire in five years. Later that year, Mr. Smith\n\ndiscussed the Deferred Option Plan with Everett Brewer, former City of Enid fire chief\n\nand a member of the System\u2019s Board of Directors, thanking him for his effort in getting\n\nthe Deferred Option Plan enacted. Mr. Brewer told Mr. Smith that \u201cit\u2019s a really good law\n\nthat they passed and fortunately you don\u2019t have to leave employment after you\u2019ve\n\ncompleted it.\u201d See II Aplt. App. at 142.\n\n       On May 31, 1990, Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 11 \u00a7 49-106.1(C) was amended to add the\n\nfollowing language:\n\n       At the conclusion of a member\u2019s participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters\n       Deferred Option Plan, the member shall terminate employment with all\n       participating municipalities as a firefighter, and shall start receiving the member\u2019s\n       accrued monthly retirement benefit from the System.\n\n1990 Okla. Sess. Laws 1753, 1754 (codified at Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 49-106.1(C)\n\n                                               4\n\f(West Supp.1998)). On June 15, 1990, the System sent a memo to all members informing\n\nthem of the legislative changes. The memo noted the addition of the five-year retirement\n\nrequirement, and noted that \u201c[t]he legislature made the change[] in keeping with their\n\npolicy of having the same benefits for all [retirement] systems.\u201d II Aplt. App. at 167.\n\n       On May 11, 1994, in response to an inquiry made by the Enid City Attorney\n\nregarding the application of the 1990 amendment, the Lawton City Attorney indicated he\n\nfelt \u201cthe firefighter that wants to stay on after [the expiration of the Deferred Option Plan]\n\nhas the winning position if he chooses to contest the issue . . . .\u201d II Aplt. App. at 168.\n\nHowever, on May 24, 1994, Bob Hollander informed Mr. Smith by letter that \u201c[a]ll\n\n[Deferred Option Plan] participants must terminate [employment] at the end of the five\n\nyear period of participation in [the] Plan . . . .\u201d Aplt. App. at 75. Though Mr. Smith\n\nrefused to petition the System Board for retirement, on August 19, 1994 the System Board\n\nvoted to approve Mr. Smith\u2019s service retirement effective September 1, 1994, the date\n\nMr. Smith was scheduled to end his participation in the Deferred Option Plan. The City\u2019s\n\nfire chief requested Mr. Smith\u2019s termination on August 22, 1994, effective August 31,\n\n1994. Mr. Smith was terminated on that date without a hearing.\n\n       Mr. Smith filed this suit on May 23, 1996, alleging that the City and the System\n\ndeprived him of due process by terminating him without a hearing and impaired his right\n\nto receive the benefits of his contract in violation of the United States Constitution. Mr.\n\nSmith also asserted breach of employment and impairment of contract claims under\n\n\n                                               5\n\fOklahoma law. The City and System moved for summary judgment, and the district court\n\ngranted their motions, holding that the statute of limitations on Mr. Smith\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims\n\nhad expired. Having dismissed the federal claims, the district court declined to exercise\n\njurisdiction over Mr. Smith\u2019s pendent state law claims.\n\n                                            Discussion\n\n       We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same\n\nstandard as the district court.

This requires\n\nthe court \u201cto identify the constitutional violation and locate it in time.\u201d Id.\n\n       Mr. Smith alleges two distinct federal constitutional violations. First, Mr. Smith\u2019s\n\nimpairment of contract claim is predicated on the Contract Clause. See U.S. Const. art. I,\n\n\u00a7 10. In his complaint, he alleges that he \u201csigned a \u2018Deferred Retirement Option Plan\u2019\n\n[sic] with the . . . System\u201d and that neither the contract he signed nor the law in existence\n\nat the time he signed it required participants in the Plan to retire. Aplee. City of Enid\n\nSupp. App. at 2. Accordingly, Mr. Smith asserts that he \u201cpossessed a vested or accrued\n\nright in his [Deferred Option Plan] contract\u201d to continued employment, and that the\n\nsubsequent 1990 amendment to the Deferred Option Plan requiring retirement cannot\n\ndefeat that contractual right. Id. at 4.\n\n       Though Mr. Smith argues his impairment claim accrued in August 1994, when the\n\nCity and System terminated his employment, the undisputed facts establish that the\n\nalleged constitutional claim\u2014the impairment of Mr. Smith\u2019s Deferred Option Plan\n\n\n                                               7\n\fcontract\u2014should have been apparent to Mr. Smith in 1990, when he received notice of\n\nthe amendment to \u00a7 49-106.1(C). Although Mr. Smith suggests his impairment claim is\n\nanalogous to actions for wrongful termination, see Aplt. Brief at 17-20, it is not. Though\n\nit is generally true that a claim for wrongful termination accrues when an employee is\n\nnotified of an adverse employment decision, Mr. Smith has brought an impairment of\n\ncontract claim, the very essence of which is a substantial impairment of plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncontractual relationship with the state by a change in law. See General Motors Corp. v.\n\nRomein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112703\"><a href=\"/opinion/112703/general-motors-corp-v-romein/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186-87 (1992). Thus, the constitutional injury, the injury which\n\ntriggers the statute of limitations for purposes of \u00a7 1983, occurred when the 1990\n\namendment became law, not when the consequence of that constitutional injury\u2014here,\n\nMr. Smith\u2019s termination by the City and System\u2014manifested itself.\n\n       Mr. Smith may not rely on Mr. Brewer\u2019s assessment of the law to defeat summary\n\njudgment. Mr. Brewer\u2019s statements are hearsay and may not be relied on in reviewing the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. See Thomas v. IBM, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689995\"><a href=\"/opinion/689995/darlene-thomas-v-international-business-machines-a-new-york-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (10th\n\nCir. 1995). Even if their content were admissible, Mr. Smith has not sufficiently\n\nestablished that his reliance on those statements would be justified, as Mr. Brewer was\n\nnot a member of the System Board at the time the statements were made and did not\n\nspeak on behalf of the Board in a representative capacity. See Lehman v. City of\n\nLouisville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585904\"><a href=\"/opinion/585904/arlin-d-lehman-pulmonary-data-services-of-america-inc-a-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1477 (10th Cir. 1992). Moreover, though Mr. Smith suggests\n\nthat prior to 1994 his claim would have been premature, the authority he cites for support\n\n\n                                             8\n\fis distinguishable. In San Miguel Consol. Fire Protection District v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. Rptr.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 343, 352 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994), a statute passed by the legislature reallocated property\n\ntax revenues from fire districts to county educational augmentation funds to benefit\n\nschool districts. There was no determination as to how much revenue would be lost. The\n\ncourt held an impairment of contract claim premature since the contract at issue would be\n\nimpaired or terminated only if property taxes were substantially reduced by the operation\n\nof the statute. In contrast, if the 1990 amendment applied to him, Mr. Smith\u2019s\n\nemployment with the City would unquestionably end in 1994. Mr. Smith admits he had\n\nactual notice of the generally applicable amendment to \u00a7 49-106.1(C) in 1990.\n\nConsequently, we hold his impairment of contract claim accrued at that time and triggered\n\nthe two year statute of limitations.\n\n       Mr. Smith also asserts a procedural due process claim against the City, arguing that\n\nhe \u201cpossesses a property interest in his employment with the . . . CITY . . . pursuant to\n\ncity ordinances, policies, procedures, customs and practice.\u201d Aplee. City of Enid Supp.\n\nApp. at 3. Mr. Smith alleges the City denied him the right \u201cto be terminated only for\n\ncause, to receive notice of the charges against him, and to receive a hearing before an\n\nimpartial hearing panel,\u201d causing him irreparable harm. Id. at 4; see Aplt. App. at 127-\n\n130. Mr. Smith\u2019s due process claim, however, is unquestionably linked to the City\u2019s\n\napplication of the 1990 amendment to him. See Aplee. City of Enid Supp. App. at 2-3\n\n(Complaint). Mr. Smith admits he had knowledge of the 1990 amendment, which clearly\n\n\n                                              9\n\frequires participants in the Deferred Option Plan to terminate employment after five years\n\nof plan participation, but asserts he did not believe the amendment applied to him2 and, in\n\nany event, did not know that if the amendment applied to him he would be terminated\n\nwithout a hearing.\n\n       We are urged, therefore, to adopt an accrual rule which would trigger the statute of\n\nlimitations in procedural due process claims when the employer notifies the employee of\n\nthe adverse employment decision.

Instead, Mr. Smith\u2019s due process argument inherently challenges the\n\nCity\u2019s compliance with the 1990 amendment. In the unusual situation with which we are\n\nfaced, state law provides that termination of employment with the City will\u2014in fact,\n\nmust\u2014occur. See, e.g., Dillon v. City of Tulsa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1151396\"><a href=\"/opinion/1151396/dillon-v-city-of-tulsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (Okla. Crim. App.\n\n1954) (holding that an ordinance must give way to the general laws of the state if they\n\nconflict). Here, the notice of termination is the statute itself, the statute is by its terms\n\nmandatory, and no amount of pre-termination process short of a lawsuit for declaratory\n\njudgment could provide relief.\n\n       Mr. Smith had actual notice of the 1990 amendment, and his complaint belies any\n\nassertion that he was unaware the City might rely on the 1990 amendment in terminating\n\nhis employment in 1994. See Aple. Supp. App. at 3, \u00b6 12 (\u201cThroughout the five year term\n\nof the [Deferred Option Plan] Contract, SMITH continually informed personnel and\n\nsupervisors at the Enid Fire Department . . . of his intention to continue his employment\n\nafter the end of the term of the Deferred Option Contract.\u201d). Moreover, Mr. Smith has\n\nnot alleged any reliance on statements made by City officials regarding his continued\n\nemployment in light of the 1990 amendment, nor has Mr. Smith alleged he had\n\nknowledge of or relied on the Lawton City Attorney\u2019s April 13, 1994 opinion. Finally,\n\nMr. Smith\u2019s subjective belief that the amendment did not apply to him is irrelevant, since\n\nour inquiry is whether Mr. Smith knew or should have known in 1990 that the City would\n\n\n                                                11\n\fcomply with the 1990 amendment and retire him at the end of the five-year period, as he\n\nhad been advised.\n\n       Under these circumstances, Mr. Smith knew or should have known that the 1990\n\namendment generally provided for termination of all Deferred Option Plan members after\n\nfive years solely because their five years of participation in the Plan had ended, that the\n\nCity would be required to comply with it, and that the City would accordingly terminate\n\nhim in 1994 without cause and a hearing. We thus affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of\n\nMr. Smith\u2019s federal claims as barred by the statute of limitations and do not reach the\n\nparties\u2019 arguments relating to the merits of those claims.\n\n         Finally, Mr. Smith argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing\n\nto exercise jurisdiction over his supplemental state law claims. When all federal claims\n\nhave been dismissed, the court may, and usually should, decline to exercise jurisdiction\n\nover any remaining state claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); Ball v.

See 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.\n\n                                        Background\n\n       Mr. Smith was employed with the City as a firefighter. By 1989, Mr. Smith had\n\nattained the rank of assistant fire chief and had accrued over twenty years of service with\n\nthe City. As required by Oklahoma statute, the City was a participating municipality in\n\nthe System, and as an eligible full time firefighter, Mr. Smith was a participating member\n\nin the System. Under the System\u2019s statutory scheme, member firefighters with twenty or\n\nmore years of service are eligible to retire and receive a monthly service pension benefit.\n\n\n\n\n       The Enid Fire Department Civil Service Commission is not a party to this appeal.\n       1\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fAt any time, retired member firefighters receiving a pension benefit may serve as\n\nfirefighters for compensation within the state of Oklahoma; they may not, however,\n\ncontinue to receive pension benefits during such service.\n\n       In October 1988, Bob Hollander, Executive Director of the System, and Pete\n\nStavrose, the Legislative Director of the Oklahoma State Firefighters Association, held a\n\nmeeting at the Enid fire station to discuss proposed legislation for a deferred\n\ncompensation plan for Oklahoma firefighters. Mr. Smith attended this meeting, where it\n\nwas related that under the proposed legislation firefighters opting to participate in the plan\n\nwould be required to retire after a set number of years.\n\n       On April 24, 1989, a deferred compensation plan for Oklahoma firefighters was\n\nenacted into law. It provided, in pertinent part:\n\n        A.    In lieu of terminating employment and accepting a service retirement\n       pension . . . any member of [the System] who has not less than twenty (20) years\n       of creditable service and who is eligible to receive a service retirement pension\n       may elect to participate in the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option Plan and\n       defer the receipts of benefits in accordance with the provisions of this section.\n       ....\n\n       C.     The duration of participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option\n       Plan for active firefighters shall not exceed five (5) years.\n\n       D.     When a member begins participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred\n       Option Plan, the contribution of the employee shall cease. The employer\n       contributions shall continue to be paid . . . . Municipal contributions for\n       employees who elect the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option Plan shall be\n       credited equally to [the System] and to the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option\n       Plan. The monthly retirement benefits that would have been payable had the\n       member elected to cease employment and receive a service retirement shall be paid\n       into the Oklahoma Firefighters Deferred Option Plan account.\n\n                                              3\n\f1989 Okla. Sess. Laws 240-41 (codified at Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 49-106.1 (West\n\nSupp.1998)). Mr. Smith received a copy of the newly enacted legislation in bill form,\n\nread it, and determined that it did not require him to retire after five years if he\n\nparticipated in the plan. Mr. Smith accordingly decided to opt into the plan, and on\n\nOctober 17, 1989, he drove to the System\u2019s offices in Oklahoma City and informed Bob\n\nHollander he wished to sign up for the Deferred Option Plan. Mr. Hollander provided\n\nMr. Smith with the form, and Mr. Smith signed it. The election form provided that\n\nparticipation in the plan was limited to five years and that Mr. Smith\u2019s deferred option\n\ndeposits would cease September 1, 1994. The election form did not explicitly provide\n\nthat Mr. Smith would be required to retire in five years. Later that year, Mr. Smith\n\ndiscussed the Deferred Option Plan with Everett Brewer, former City of Enid fire chief\n\nand a member of the System\u2019s Board of Directors, thanking him for his effort in getting\n\nthe Deferred Option Plan enacted. Mr. Brewer told Mr. Smith that \u201cit\u2019s a really good law\n\nthat they passed and fortunately you don\u2019t have to leave employment after you\u2019ve\n\ncompleted it.\u201d See II Aplt. App. at 142.\n\n       On May 31, 1990, Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 11 \u00a7 49-106.1(C) was amended to add the\n\nfollowing language:\n\n       At the conclusion of a member\u2019s participation in the Oklahoma Firefighters\n       Deferred Option Plan, the member shall terminate employment with all\n       participating municipalities as a firefighter, and shall start receiving the member\u2019s\n       accrued monthly retirement benefit from the System.\n\n1990 Okla. Sess. Laws 1753, 1754 (codified at Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 49-106.1(C)\n\n                                               4\n\f(West Supp.1998)). On June 15, 1990, the System sent a memo to all members informing\n\nthem of the legislative changes. The memo noted the addition of the five-year retirement\n\nrequirement, and noted that \u201c[t]he legislature made the change[] in keeping with their\n\npolicy of having the same benefits for all [retirement] systems.\u201d II Aplt. App. at 167.\n\n       On May 11, 1994, in response to an inquiry made by the Enid City Attorney\n\nregarding the application of the 1990 amendment, the Lawton City Attorney indicated he\n\nfelt \u201cthe firefighter that wants to stay on after [the expiration of the Deferred Option Plan]\n\nhas the winning position if he chooses to contest the issue . . . .\u201d II Aplt. App. at 168.\n\nHowever, on May 24, 1994, Bob Hollander informed Mr. Smith by letter that \u201c[a]ll\n\n[Deferred Option Plan] participants must terminate [employment] at the end of the five\n\nyear period of participation in [the] Plan . . . .\u201d Aplt. App. at 75. Though Mr. Smith\n\nrefused to petition the System Board for retirement, on August 19, 1994 the System Board\n\nvoted to approve Mr. Smith\u2019s service retirement effective September 1, 1994, the date\n\nMr. Smith was scheduled to end his participation in the Deferred Option Plan. The City\u2019s\n\nfire chief requested Mr. Smith\u2019s termination on August 22, 1994, effective August 31,\n\n1994. Mr. Smith was terminated on that date without a hearing.\n\n       Mr. Smith filed this suit on May 23, 1996, alleging that the City and the System\n\ndeprived him of due process by terminating him without a hearing and impaired his right\n\nto receive the benefits of his contract in violation of the United States Constitution. Mr.\n\nSmith also asserted breach of employment and impairment of contract claims under\n\n\n                                               5\n\fOklahoma law. The City and System moved for summary judgment, and the district court\n\ngranted their motions, holding that the statute of limitations on Mr. Smith\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims\n\nhad expired. Having dismissed the federal claims, the district court declined to exercise\n\njurisdiction over Mr. Smith\u2019s pendent state law claims.\n\n                                            Discussion\n\n       We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same\n\nstandard as the district court. See Lytle v. City of Haysville, 138 F.2d 857, 862 (10th Cir.\n\n1998). Summary judgment is proper if the evidence submitted by the parties, viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to the non-movant, indicates that there is no genuine issue as to\n\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Lytle, 138 F.2d at 862. Where, as here, the facts and dates are not\n\ndisputed, we may as a matter of law determine when a cause of action accrued. See\n\nEdwards v. International Union, United Plant Guard Workers, 46 F.3d 1047, 1050 (10th\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811 (1995).\n\n       Though the two year limitations period governing both of Mr. Smith\u2019s \u00a7 1983\n\nclaims is a creature of state law, see Abbitt v. Franklin, 731 F.2d 661, 663 (10th Cir.\n\n1984) (en banc), federal law governs the question of accrual of federal causes of action,\n\nand thus, dictates when the statute of limitations begins to run for purposes of \u00a7 1983.\n\nSee Fratus v. Deland, 49 F.3d 673, 675 (10th Cir. 1995); Baker v. Board of Regents, 991\n\nF.2d 628, 632 (10th Cir. 1993). \u201cA civil rights action accrues when the plaintiff knows or\n\n\n                                                6\n\fhas reason to know of the injury which is the basis of the action.\u201d Baker, 991 F.2d at 632;\n\nsee Hunt v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1263, 1266 (10th Cir.) (quoting Johnson v. Johnson County\n\nComm\u2019n Bd., 925 F.2d 1299, 1301 (10th Cir.1991)), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 832 (1994).\n\nSince the injury in a \u00a7 1983 case is the violation of a constitutional right, see Garcia v.\n\nWilson, 731 F.2d 640, 650 (10th Cir. 1984), aff\u2019d, 471 U.S. 261 (1985), such claims\n\naccrue \u201cwhen the plaintiff knows or should know that his or her constitutional rights have\n\nbeen violated.\u201d Lawshe v. Simpson, 16 F.3d 1475, 1478 (7th Cir. 1994). This requires\n\nthe court \u201cto identify the constitutional violation and locate it in time.\u201d Id.\n\n       Mr. Smith alleges two distinct federal constitutional violations. First, Mr. Smith\u2019s\n\nimpairment of contract claim is predicated on the Contract Clause. See U.S. Const. art. I,\n\n\u00a7 10. In his complaint, he alleges that he \u201csigned a \u2018Deferred Retirement Option Plan\u2019\n\n[sic] with the . . . System\u201d and that neither the contract he signed nor the law in existence\n\nat the time he signed it required participants in the Plan to retire. Aplee. City of Enid\n\nSupp. App. at 2. Accordingly, Mr. Smith asserts that he \u201cpossessed a vested or accrued\n\nright in his [Deferred Option Plan] contract\u201d to continued employment, and that the\n\nsubsequent 1990 amendment to the Deferred Option Plan requiring retirement cannot\n\ndefeat that contractual right. Id. at 4.\n\n       Though Mr. Smith argues his impairment claim accrued in August 1994, when the\n\nCity and System terminated his employment, the undisputed facts establish that the\n\nalleged constitutional claim\u2014the impairment of Mr. Smith\u2019s Deferred Option Plan\n\n\n                                               7\n\fcontract\u2014should have been apparent to Mr. Smith in 1990, when he received notice of\n\nthe amendment to \u00a7 49-106.1(C). Although Mr. Smith suggests his impairment claim is\n\nanalogous to actions for wrongful termination, see Aplt. Brief at 17-20, it is not. Though\n\nit is generally true that a claim for wrongful termination accrues when an employee is\n\nnotified of an adverse employment decision, Mr. Smith has brought an impairment of\n\ncontract claim, the very essence of which is a substantial impairment of plaintiff\u2019s\n\ncontractual relationship with the state by a change in law. See General Motors Corp. v.\n\nRomein, 503 U.S. 181, 186-87 (1992). Thus, the constitutional injury, the injury which\n\ntriggers the statute of limitations for purposes of \u00a7 1983, occurred when the 1990\n\namendment became law, not when the consequence of that constitutional injury\u2014here,\n\nMr. Smith\u2019s termination by the City and System\u2014manifested itself.\n\n       Mr. Smith may not rely on Mr. Brewer\u2019s assessment of the law to defeat summary\n\njudgment. Mr. Brewer\u2019s statements are hearsay and may not be relied on in reviewing the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. See Thomas v. IBM, 48 F.3d 478, 485 (10th\n\nCir. 1995). Even if their content were admissible, Mr. Smith has not sufficiently\n\nestablished that his reliance on those statements would be justified, as Mr. Brewer was\n\nnot a member of the System Board at the time the statements were made and did not\n\nspeak on behalf of the Board in a representative capacity. See Lehman v. City of\n\nLouisville, 967 F.2d 1474, 1477 (10th Cir. 1992). Moreover, though Mr. Smith suggests\n\nthat prior to 1994 his claim would have been premature, the authority he cites for support\n\n\n                                             8\n\fis distinguishable. In San Miguel Consol. Fire Protection District v. Davis, 30 Cal. Rptr.\n\n2d 343, 352 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994), a statute passed by the legislature reallocated property\n\ntax revenues from fire districts to county educational augmentation funds to benefit\n\nschool districts. There was no determination as to how much revenue would be lost. The\n\ncourt held an impairment of contract claim premature since the contract at issue would be\n\nimpaired or terminated only if property taxes were substantially reduced by the operation\n\nof the statute. In contrast, if the 1990 amendment applied to him, Mr. Smith\u2019s\n\nemployment with the City would unquestionably end in 1994. Mr. Smith admits he had\n\nactual notice of the generally applicable amendment to \u00a7 49-106.1(C) in 1990.\n\nConsequently, we hold his impairment of contract claim accrued at that time and triggered\n\nthe two year statute of limitations.\n\n       Mr. Smith also asserts a procedural due process claim against the City, arguing that\n\nhe \u201cpossesses a property interest in his employment with the . . . CITY . . . pursuant to\n\ncity ordinances, policies, procedures, customs and practice.\u201d Aplee. City of Enid Supp.\n\nApp. at 3. Mr. Smith alleges the City denied him the right \u201cto be terminated only for\n\ncause, to receive notice of the charges against him, and to receive a hearing before an\n\nimpartial hearing panel,\u201d causing him irreparable harm. Id. at 4; see Aplt. App. at 127-\n\n130. Mr. Smith\u2019s due process claim, however, is unquestionably linked to the City\u2019s\n\napplication of the 1990 amendment to him. See Aplee. City of Enid Supp. App. at 2-3\n\n(Complaint). Mr. Smith admits he had knowledge of the 1990 amendment, which clearly\n\n\n                                              9\n\frequires participants in the Deferred Option Plan to terminate employment after five years\n\nof plan participation, but asserts he did not believe the amendment applied to him2 and, in\n\nany event, did not know that if the amendment applied to him he would be terminated\n\nwithout a hearing.\n\n       We are urged, therefore, to adopt an accrual rule which would trigger the statute of\n\nlimitations in procedural due process claims when the employer notifies the employee of\n\nthe adverse employment decision. Several circuits have so held, with varying\n\nunderstandings of when employer notice is adequate. See, e.g., Lawshe, 16 F.3d at 1480\n\n(claim for deprivation of public employment without due process accrues on date of\n\nactual termination of employment); Hoesterey v. City of Cathedral City, 945 F.2d 317,\n\n320 (9th Cir. 1991) (clear notice of a final decision to terminate without further process\n\nmay occur prior to actual termination); Rubin v. O\u2019Koren, 621 F.2d 114, 116 (5th Cir.\n\n1980) (cause of action accrued when employment period terminated), reh\u2019g granted on\n\nother grounds, 644 F.2d 1023 (5th Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 910 (1992). We are\n\nnot, however, presented with a standard procedural due process claim, wherein the\n\n\n\n       2\n         This belief is apparently grounded in Mr. Smith\u2019s argument that he had a vested\nright to continued employment with the City under the Deferred Option Plan as it was\nenacted in 1989. Because we do not address the merits of Mr. Smith\u2019s claims, we need\nnot address his contention that he had a vested right in continued employment,\nnotwithstanding Taylor v. State & Educ. Employees Group Ins. Program, 897 P.2d 275,\n279 (Okla. 1995); Woods v. City of Lawton, 845 P.2d 880, 883 (Okla. 1992); and Baker\nv. Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement Sys., 718 P.2d 348, 352-53 (Okla.\n1986).\n\n                                             10\n\fplaintiff complains of termination without cause and a hearing based on her exercise of a\n\nconstitutional right. Instead, Mr. Smith\u2019s due process argument inherently challenges the\n\nCity\u2019s compliance with the 1990 amendment. In the unusual situation with which we are\n\nfaced, state law provides that termination of employment with the City will\u2014in fact,\n\nmust\u2014occur. See, e.g., Dillon v. City of Tulsa, 273 P.2d 145, 150 (Okla. Crim. App.\n\n1954) (holding that an ordinance must give way to the general laws of the state if they\n\nconflict). Here, the notice of termination is the statute itself, the statute is by its terms\n\nmandatory, and no amount of pre-termination process short of a lawsuit for declaratory\n\njudgment could provide relief.\n\n       Mr. Smith had actual notice of the 1990 amendment, and his complaint belies any\n\nassertion that he was unaware the City might rely on the 1990 amendment in terminating\n\nhis employment in 1994. See Aple. Supp. App. at 3, \u00b6 12 (\u201cThroughout the five year term\n\nof the [Deferred Option Plan] Contract, SMITH continually informed personnel and\n\nsupervisors at the Enid Fire Department . . . of his intention to continue his employment\n\nafter the end of the term of the Deferred Option Contract.\u201d). Moreover, Mr. Smith has\n\nnot alleged any reliance on statements made by City officials regarding his continued\n\nemployment in light of the 1990 amendment, nor has Mr. Smith alleged he had\n\nknowledge of or relied on the Lawton City Attorney\u2019s April 13, 1994 opinion. Finally,\n\nMr. Smith\u2019s subjective belief that the amendment did not apply to him is irrelevant, since\n\nour inquiry is whether Mr. Smith knew or should have known in 1990 that the City would\n\n\n                                                11\n\fcomply with the 1990 amendment and retire him at the end of the five-year period, as he\n\nhad been advised.\n\n       Under these circumstances, Mr. Smith knew or should have known that the 1990\n\namendment generally provided for termination of all Deferred Option Plan members after\n\nfive years solely because their five years of participation in the Plan had ended, that the\n\nCity would be required to comply with it, and that the City would accordingly terminate\n\nhim in 1994 without cause and a hearing. We thus affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of\n\nMr. Smith\u2019s federal claims as barred by the statute of limitations and do not reach the\n\nparties\u2019 arguments relating to the merits of those claims.\n\n         Finally, Mr. Smith argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing\n\nto exercise jurisdiction over his supplemental state law claims. When all federal claims\n\nhave been dismissed, the court may, and usually should, decline to exercise jurisdiction\n\nover any remaining state claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); Ball v. Renner, 54 F.3d\n\n664, 669 (10th Cir. 1995). After a thorough review of the record and the authority cited\n\nby Mr. Smith, we cannot say the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his\n\nremaining state claims.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "52b9b0cd4cccea882d2211c3877482e388ced582", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/111415/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112703/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/377972/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/388774/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/433620/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/433623/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/555892/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/568606/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/585904/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/604925/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/663711/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/664146/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/687710/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/689995/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/691143/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/695615/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1151396/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1159967/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1202091/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1213735/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2010-08-14T04:42:07Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 12, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/156599/smith-v-city-of-enid/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "156599", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Smith v.
