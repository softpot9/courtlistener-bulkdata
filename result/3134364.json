She and her codefendant, Dwight</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Jordan, were tried simultaneously by separate juries in the circuit</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court of Cook County. Defendant's jury convicted her of first</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>degree murder, two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and two counts of aggravated kidnapping. The jury determined that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>there were no mitigating factors sufficient to preclude imposition</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of the death penalty. The trial court sentenced defendant to death</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>for first degree murder. Additionally, the court sentenced</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant to three consecutive prison terms of 60 and 30 years for</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>aggravated criminal sexual assault and 15 years for aggravated</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>kidnapping.

The next</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>day, defendant spoke to law enforcement officers and signed a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court-reported confession. On appeal, defendant does not challenge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the admissibility of this confession. In the confession, defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>related the following account of the murder.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March 21, defendant was outside on the street when Shenosha</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>asked to come to her house. Defendant took Shenosha to her third-</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>floor apartment. Upon entering the apartment, she took Shenosha to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>her bedroom, where Dwight Jordan, her boyfriend and codefendant,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was sitting on the bed. She told Shenosha to sit down and watch</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>television. Defendant then went to the kitchen to use cocaine, and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>remained there for half an hour. When she returned to the bedroom,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Shenosha was on the floor crying, with her underwear down to her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>knees. Jordan was behind her on the floor, fondling his penis in an</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>attempt to achieve an erection. Upon failing to do so, he picked up</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a white shoe polish bottle and inserted it into Shenosha's rectum.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Shenosha continued crying and asked Jordan to stop, saying that she</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>would not tell anyone.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant further confessed that Jordan then told her to get</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a hammer. After retrieving the hammer, defendant put saliva on it</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and inserted the straight end into Shenosha's vagina. As defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>did this, Jordan continued inserting the shoe polish bottle in and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>out of Shenosha's rectum. Defendant and Jordan continued this</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>activity for 10 minutes. When they stopped, Shenosha was crying.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Defendant put her hand over Shenosha's mouth, and Shenosha tried to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>scream. Defendant then took an electrical cord from a television,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>wrapped it around Shenosha's neck, and \"started to strangle her.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant stated that she then took Shenosha to an empty</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>apartment down the hall, with the electrical cord still wrapped</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>around her neck. Defendant said that as they entered this</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>apartment, Shenosha fell onto a board with a nail protruding from</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>it. Defendant took Shenosha to the kitchen of the apartment where</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>she started a fire \"to scare her.\" After defendant put the fire</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>out, Shenosha said that she would not tell anyone, except that she</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>would have to tell her parents. At that point, defendant pulled the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>cord tighter around Shenosha's neck and continued tightening it for</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>10 minutes. Then, because she heard knocking on the door of her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>apartment down the hall, she put Shenosha in a closet in the empty</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>apartment and threw Shenosha's shoes out the window.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant said that she looked in the closet a few minutes</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>later and saw that Shenosha was not breathing. Defendant then took</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the hammer that she had used earlier and hit Shenosha on the head</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>three or four times. Defendant then placed Shenosha in a garbage</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>can, hit her on the head with a two-by-four, and tried to cover her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>up with garbage.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant said that she gave this statement willingly, fully</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>aware of her constitutional rights to remain silent and have the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>assistance of counsel. Investigators who searched the crime scene</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>recovered Shenosha's shoes, a hammer, a white shoe polish bottle,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and a triangular piece of wood with a protruding nail.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At trial, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the victim testified that Shenosha suffered 42 distinct injuries.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>She sustained two puncture wounds to her chest which damaged her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>lungs and coronary artery. The examiner testified that these wounds</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>were consistent with being struck by a board with a nail. Shenosha</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>had six lacerations on her head, three of which penetrated through</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to the skull. These injuries were consistent with being hit with a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>hammer, or a board such as a two-by-four. She had injuries under</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>her chin which were consistent with ligature strangulation. She</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sustained lacerations to the skin of her anus which were consistent</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>with a traumatic penetration or sexual assault. Injuries caused by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the penetration were at least eight inches deep, consistent with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the handle of the hammer or the shoe-polish bottle. She also had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>lacerations alongside her clitoris and on the lower surface of her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>vagina extending to her anus which were consistent with penetration</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of the hammer or the shoe-polish bottle.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its case in chief, the defense called a psychologist who</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>had examined defendant in 1994. He testified that defendant has an</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>IQ of 69 and that he believed her to be mildly mentally retarded.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>He further testified that a person with defendant's degree of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>mental retardation would be easily influenced by others, would not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>anticipate the consequences of her actions, and would have</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>difficulty predicting the outcome of a situation.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In rebuttal, the State called a psychologist who had examined</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant in 1991. He testified that he did not believe defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was mentally retarded. He also testified that defendant had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>malingered, or faked mental illness, during his examination of her,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and further opined that she likely did so during the 1994</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>examination as well.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder (720</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ILCS 5/9--1(a)(1) (West 1992)), two counts of aggravated criminal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sexual assault (720 ILCS 5/12--14(a)(2) (West 1992)), and two</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>counts of aggravated kidnapping (720 ILCS 5/10--2(a)(3) (West</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>1992)). The jury then found defendant eligible for the death</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sentence on two grounds: (1) that she committed the murder in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>course of other felonies, namely, aggravated criminal sexual</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>assault and aggravated kidnapping (720 ILCS 5/9--1(b)(6) (West</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>1992)); and (2) that the victim was under the age of 12 and her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>death resulted from exceptionally brutal and heinous behavior</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>indicative of wanton cruelty (720 ILCS 5/9--1(b)(7) (West 1992)).</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the second stage of the sentencing hearing, the State</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>offered evidence in aggravation. An employee of the Department of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Children and Family Services testified that defendant frequently</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>had been placed in state facilities as a youth, but had often run</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>away. The employee testified that on one occasion, defendant ran</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>away with another girl who was under state care, and that while the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>two were gone, defendant physically forced the girl to submit to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>oral, anal, and vaginal sex performed by one of defendant's former</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>boyfriends.

Simms, 143 Ill. 2d at 174. We hold that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>statements made by bystanders at the crime scene were not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>inadmissible hearsay because they were not offered to prove what</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>they asserted, i.e., that defendant fled and that she was taken</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>into police custody. Rather, the statements were offered to explain</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the steps taken by the police in investigating the crimes and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>apprehending defendant.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant next argues that the trial testimony of Kenosha,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Shenosha's sister, contained inadmissible hearsay. Kenosha</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testified that on the day of the murder, a young girl in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>neighborhood told her that Shenosha had gone to the movies with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Shenosha's aunt. We hold that this statement was not inadmissible</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>statement. Shenosha had not gone anywhere with her aunt, but rather</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was in defendant's apartment at the time. The statement was offered</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to explain why Kenosha continued looking for Shenosha after talking</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>with the young girl.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kenosha also testified that while she was looking for her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sister, she encountered codefendant Jordan, who told her that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant \"live[s] up there.\" This statement also was not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>inadmissible hearsay, as it was not offered to prove that defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in fact lived in the apartment Jordan identified. No one disputed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>this fact at trial. The statement was instead offered to explain</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>why Kenosha and her mother went to defendant's apartment.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant further contends that some of the testimony given by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Emma Richards, Shenosha's mother, was hearsay. Emma testified that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the night before the murder, Shenosha asked her if she knew Dwight</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Jordan's girlfriend. Emma testified that when she answered yes,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Shenosha told her that Jordan's girlfriend had taken her to a park</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>across the street that day. We reject defendant's contention that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>these statements made by the victim were hearsay. The statements</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>were not offered to prove that defendant took Shenosha to the park,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>but were instead offered to explain why Emma and Kenosha sought out</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant after they discovered that Shenosha was missing.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Emma also testified that while she was searching for her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>daughter, a neighbor, Leslie Moon, told her that no one had left</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's apartment recently. We likewise do not believe this</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>statement was hearsay, because it was offered not to prove that no</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>one had left the apartment, but rather to show why Kenosha and her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>mother went to the apartment a second time.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Emma further testified that during her search, Moon</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>told her that she had observed defendant place something in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>garbage can on the porch of defendant's apartment. We agree with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant that the purpose for offering this statement was to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>corroborate the State's allegation that defendant placed the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>victim's body in the garbage can. The statement was therefore</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>hearsay, and the trial court erred in admitting it. We do not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>believe, however, that this error requires reversal of defendant's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conviction. An error in the admission of evidence is harmless if</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>properly admitted evidence is so overwhelming that no fair-minded</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>juror could reasonably have voted to acquit the defendant.

A police officer who</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>investigated the murder testified that he found the book on a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>coffee table in defendant's apartment two days after the murder.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The officer testified that he did not notice the book when he</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>searched the apartment the day after the murder. He testified that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the apartment was not locked between the time of the murder and his</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>discovery of the book. No testimony was offered concerning the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nature of the book's contents, or about who owned or had read the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>book.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant objected when the State sought to introduce the book</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>into evidence. Defendant argued that the book's potential for</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>prejudice outweighed any probative value it might have. Defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>also contended that there was insufficient evidence linking her to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the book, because there was no testimony that she owned or had read</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>it, and because the apartment had not been secured between the time</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of the murder and the discovery of the book. The trial court ruled</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that the cover and title of the book were probative to show the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's state of mind, and overruled defendant's objections.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The jury was allowed to view only the cover of the book and to hear</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the testimony of the investigating officer about where and when he</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>found it.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evidentiary rulings are within the sound discretion of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial court and will not be disturbed on review unless the court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>has abused that discretion.

The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>psychologist testified that during the 1991 examination, defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>stated that she heard voices and acted as though she were talking</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to an invisible person.

We hold that defendant waived any error in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>admission of this testimony by failing to object when the testimony</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was offered at trial. Miller, 173 Ill. 2d at 191.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant contends, however, that because the trial court's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>admission of the testimony concerning the fitness examination was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>plain error, her failure to object does not constitute waiver.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Under the plain error doctrine, a reviewing court may consider a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial error not properly preserved by objection when (1) the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>evidence is closely balanced or (2) the error is so fundamental and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of such a magnitude that the defendant was denied her right to a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>fair trial.

Miller, 173 Ill. 2d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>at 191. We also reject defendant's argument that the admission of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>this evidence at sentencing was plain error. The evidence of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's guilt was overwhelming and there was a substantial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>amount of evidence in aggravation. In addition, because defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was the first to introduce psychiatric evidence, admission of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testimony concerning the fitness examination did not deprive her of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a fundamental right.

Furthermore, we hold that defense</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>counsel's failure to object to the admission of this evidence at</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sentencing did not violate defendant's sixth amendment right to the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>effective assistance of counsel because, in light of the evidence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>against her, defendant failed to establish a reasonable probability</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that the jury's verdict would have been different absent counsel's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>alleged error. Albanese, 104 Ill. 2d at 525.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant also contends that the psychologist's testimony at</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sentencing about sexual sadism improperly converted the mitigating</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>factor of mental illness into an aggravating factor.

First, defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>argues that the testimony was irrelevant and prejudicial. The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>inmate testified that defendant confessed to committing the sexual</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>assault and murder at issue in the instant case.

The examining doctor testified that the infant had a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>severe second-degree burn in a clearly demarcated line around her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>buttocks. The doctor testified that he believed the burn was caused</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>by someone intentionally dipping the child into scalding water,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>because there were no burns or splash marks on any other part of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>her body. Defendant argues that because it is plausible that her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>daughter was burned accidentally, the doctor's testimony was unduly</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>prejudicial. We disagree. Given the State's presentation of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>extensive additional evidence that defendant had a history of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sexually and physically abusing her daughter, the testimony</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>concerning the burn injury was admissible.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, defendant contends that the trial court erred in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>admitting evidence that she allegedly sexually assaulted another</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>inmate while incarcerated awaiting trial. A prison guard testified</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that one morning, several inmates told her that defendant had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sexually assaulted an inmate. The guard testified that when she</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>asked the alleged victim if defendant had assaulted her, the inmate</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nodded slightly, but would not say anything out loud. The guard</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testified that the alleged victim had marks on her neck, face and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>arm, and seemed frightened of defendant. The guard further</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testified that no report was filed about the incident because the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>alleged victim refused to talk about it.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant argues that this testimony was inadmissible because</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>it was not corroborated by a prison disciplinary report. Evidence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>is admissible at the aggravation/mitigation phase of a sentencing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>hearing, however, as long as it is relevant and reliable.

This determination lies within</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the discretion of the trial judge. People v. Eddmonds, 101 Ill. 2d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>44, 65 (1984). Because the allegations that defendant perpetrated</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a sexual assault were corroborated by the guard's testimony that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the alleged victim was visibly injured and frightened after the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>incident, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in admitting this testimony.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant also argues that the guard improperly testified as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to the race of the incarcerated sexual assault victim, describing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>her as \"a real petite little white girl.\" Because this reference</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>consisted of a single, isolated statement, we hold that it was not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>intended to incite racial prejudice, and did not in fact have such</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>an effect.

The jury</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was repeatedly instructed that it was not to be influenced by any</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>person's race, and we find no error in the court's handling of this</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testimony.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exclusion of Testimony Concerning Mental Disabilities</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant contends that the trial court erred in refusing to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>allow a witness to testify regarding the difficulties faced by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>mentally handicapped people. The offered witness was a member of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the Illinois Human Rights Commission at the time of trial, and had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>previously served as chair of the Advisory Council for the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Education of Handicapped Children of the Illinois State Board of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Education. In an offer of proof, she testified that mentally</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>handicapped people have a difficult time learning. She also</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testified that mentally handicapped parents need support because</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>they have trouble performing basic parenting skills. On cross-</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>examination, she conceded that she was not acquainted with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's case.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court refused to allow the witness to testify before</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the jury. Defendant argues that this was error because the evidence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the witness would have offered was relevant to mitigation. The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>determination of relevance lies within the discretion of the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge. Eddmonds, 101 Ill. 2d at 65. When the witness was introduced</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to the court, the defense conceded that it had already presented</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>expert testimony substantially similar to the testimony it desired</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the witness to offer. The defense also conceded that the witness</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>would not be offering expert testimony. The witness admitted that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>she did not know defendant and had not reviewed her medical</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>history. Finally, the defense failed to notify the court or the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>State that it would offer the witness until the moment it did so.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Given the above factors, as well as the trial judge's observation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that there was a significant dispute over whether defendant was in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>fact mentally retarded, we hold that the trial court did not abuse</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>its discretion in refusing to allow the witness to testify.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0State's Closing Argument at Sentencing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defendant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>State to make various arguments to the jury at the conclusion of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the sentencing phase of trial. Specifically, defendant asserts that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the State improperly argued that there was no excuse for</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's crimes, that defense counsel was trying to make the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>jury feel guilty, that the evidence clearly established defendant's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>guilt, and that defendant's daughter was a \"cocaine baby.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that defendant waived these issues by failing to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>object contemporaneously when the arguments were made.

The note consisted of the following question:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"What happens if we cannot reach a unanimous decision on either</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>verdict?\" Defendant moved that the court respond to this inquiry by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>giving the jury the following instruction: \"According to the law,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>if you are not unanimous, you are to sign the verdict that says you</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>are not unanimous and it is a no death verdict.\" The court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>overruled this motion, and instead instructed the jury in writing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>as follows: \"You have your instructions. Keep deliberating.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general rule is that the trial court has a duty to provide</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>instructions to the jury where it has posed an explicit question or</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>requested clarification on a point of law arising from facts about</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>which there is doubt or confusion. People v. Childs, 159 Ill. 2d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>217, 228-29 (1994). A trial court may, however, exercise its</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>discretion and properly decline to answer a jury's inquiries where</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the instructions are readily understandable and sufficiently</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>explain the relevant law; where further instructions would serve no</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>useful purpose or would potentially mislead the jury; when the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>jury's inquiry involves a question of fact; or if providing an</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>answer would cause the court to express an opinion which would</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>likely direct a verdict one way or another.

In a related argument, defendant asserts that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sections 9--1(c) and (e) are unconstitutionally vague because they</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>allow the jury to consider aggravating factors other than those</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>enumerated in the statute.

The legislature has enacted a detailed statutory scheme to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ensure that that prohibition is honored, and section 104--14 of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Code of Criminal Procedure is an integral part of that scheme. In</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ruling as it has, the majority has rendered section 104--14 a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nullity. By so doing, it has taken something that was intended to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>protect the integrity of the criminal process and subverted it into</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a trap for defendants who may be suffering from mental or</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>psychological impairments. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this day forward, any defendant who cooperates with a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court-ordered fitness hearing does so at his own peril. Under the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>majority's analysis, trial courts will be free to disregard the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>terms of section 104--14 without risk of reversal, even where a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>timely objection is made, just as long as there is enough other</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>evidence to support a conviction. For my colleagues, it is simply</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a question of the ends justifying the means.
