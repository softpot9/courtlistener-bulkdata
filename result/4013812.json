In 2011, V. Calvin Howell sought building permits from the\n\nCity of Bolivar to make improvements to three properties he owned. Howell\u2019s requests were\n\ndenied, and he sued various city officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for violations of the First\n\nAmendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Tennessee Open Meetings Act. The district\n\ncourt dismissed the suit because Howell\u2019s federal claims were barred by the statute of\n\fCase No. 15-6254, Howell v. Farris\n\n\nlimitations, which left the court without supplemental jurisdiction to hear his state-law claims.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n       Howell\u2019s first argument is that a district court may not grant a motion to dismiss based on\n\nthe statute of limitations. Howell cites the magistrate judge\u2019s report in Sanders v. Williams\n\nEquipment & Supply Co., which stated that \u201cthe statute of limitations issue in most cases cannot\n\nbe decided on a motion to dismiss or from the face of a plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\u201d No. 09\u201302281\u2013\n\nA/P, 2010 WL 5575483, at *4 (W.D. Tenn. Dec. 29, 2010) (quoting United States v. Carrell, 681\n\nF. Supp. 2d 874, 888 (M.D. Tenn. 2009)), adopted by, No. 09\u20132281\u2013STA\u2013tmp, 2011 WL\n\n111713, at *1 (W.D. Tenn. Jan. 13, 2011). The magistrate judge in that case made that statement\n\nin the context of explaining that, as \u201ca general rule, a plaintiff is not required to plead facts\n\nplacing a claim within the limitations period \u2018because the statute of limitations is an affirmative\n\ndefense for which the defendant bears the burden of proof.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting Carrell, 681 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 888). However, the magistrate judge went on to note that the \u201cSixth Circuit has held\n\n. . . that a plaintiff may have an obligation to plead facts in avoidance of the statute of limitations\n\ndefense if \u2018it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the time limit for bringing the\n\nclaim[s] has passed.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (alteration in original) (quoting Carrell, 681 F. Supp. 2d at 888).\n\nThe magistrate judge then concluded that the documents in the record \u201cclearly demonstrate[d]\n\nthat Sanders filed his discrimination charge long after the statute of limitations had run,\u201d and\n\nconcluded that \u201chis Title VII and THRA claims are time-barred.\u201d Ibid.\n\n       Having put Sanders in context, it is clear that we must decide whether \u201cit is apparent\n\nfrom the face of the complaint that the limit for bringing the claim[s] has passed.\u201d Bishop v.\n\nLucent Technologies, Inc., 520 F.3d 516, 520 (6th Cir. 2008) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nHoover v. Langston Equip. Assocs., Inc., 958 F.2d 742, 744 (6th Cir. 1992)). We review the\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fCase No. 15-6254, Howell v. Farris\n\n\ndistrict court\u2019s decision on that question de novo. See Cooey v. Strickland, 479 F.3d 412, 415\n\n(6th Cir. 2007).\n\n       \u201cThe statute of limitations applicable to a \u00a7 1983 action is the state statute of limitations\n\napplicable to personal injury actions under the law of the state in which the \u00a7 1983 claim arises.\u201d\n\nEidson v. Tenn. Dep\u2019t of Children\u2019s Servs., 510 F.3d 631, 634 (6th Cir. 2007). Our court has\n\npreviously held that the applicable limitations period in Tennessee is one year, based on Tenn.\n\nCode Ann. \u00a7 28\u20133\u2013104(a). Hughes v. Vanderbilt Univ., 215 F.3d 543, 547 (6th Cir. 2000);\n\nBerndt v. Tennessee, 796 F.2d 879, 883 (6th Cir. 1986). Although the applicable time period is\n\nborrowed from state law, the \u201cdate on which the statute of limitations begins to run in a \u00a7 1983\n\naction is a question of federal law.\u201d Eidson, 510 F.3d at 635. \u201cOrdinarily, the limitation period\n\nstarts to run when the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the injury which is the basis of his\n\naction.\u201d Ibid. \u201c[I]n determining when the cause of action accrues in section 1983 actions, we\n\nhave looked to what event should have alerted the typical lay person to protect his or her right.\u201d\n\nIbid. (alteration in original) (quoting Kuhnle Bros., Inc. v. County of Geauga, 103 F.3d 516, 520\n\n(6th Cir. 1997)).\n\n       According to Howell\u2019s complaint, his first request for building permits was denied on\n\nJune 6, 2011, by the City of Bolivar\u2019s Building and Code Enforcement Officer, Jimmy Farris.\n\nFarris later denied Howell\u2019s requests on several other occasions, leading Howell to seek recourse\n\nfrom the Mayor, and subsequently, the City Council. Howell went to the City Council on\n\nJanuary 8, 2013, and on February 12, 2013, and each time the City Council refused to consider\n\nHowell\u2019s request. These denials and refusals are the injuries that form the basis of his federal\n\nconstitutional claims, and as such, he should have known of their existence by February 12,\n\n2013, at the latest. That Howell sought the assistance of an attorney, who drafted a letter to\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fCase No. 15-6254, Howell v. Farris\n\n\nMayor Barrett Stevens dated February 26, 2013, further bolsters this conclusion. In that letter,\n\nHowell\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cIt is my opinion that the City of Bolivar . . . has wrongfully and\n\nunlawfully refused Mr. Howell his requested building permits. . . . For reasons I can not\n\nunderstand, the City singled Mr. Howell out for treatment in this regard different than other\n\nsimilarly situated residents.\u201d This letter suggests that, as of February 26, 2013, Howell was well\n\naware of the injuries underlying his claims. Howell filed his suit on February 10, 2015, nearly\n\ntwo years after that date, which means that his suit is barred by the one-year statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n       To rebut this conclusion, Howell argues that he discovered the basis of his claims during\n\ndepositions taken in state-court litigation that occurred within one year of the date on which he\n\nfiled his suit. That argument is unpersuasive.\n\n       Howell\u2019s First Amendment claims are based on an alleged deprivation of his rights to\n\n\u201cprotes[t] Defendants\u2019 unlawful treatment of him\u201d and \u201cappeal . . . to the Bolivar City Council.\u201d\n\nHowell alleges that the defendants took \u201cadverse action . . . that would be likely to chill a person\n\nof ordinary fitness when continuing to engage in that activity.\u201d Even if we assume that the\n\ndefendants\u2019 actions did in fact violate Howell\u2019s free-speech rights, Howell would surely have\n\nknown of the injuries when the speech-chilling conduct took place and not at a subsequent\n\ndeposition.\n\n       A similar problem afflicts Howell\u2019s due-process claims. Those claims are based on the\n\ndefendants\u2019 allegedly \u201carbitrar[y] and capriciou[s] deni[al]\u201d of the building permits, and their\n\n\u201crefus[al] to hear Plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the denial of the building permits.\u201d Again, Howell should\n\nhave known of the existence of these injuries at the time they occurred, i.e., when his building\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fCase No. 15-6254, Howell v. Farris\n\n\npermits were allegedly denied without a reasonable basis and when the City Council refused to\n\nhear his requests.\n\n          As for his equal-protection claims, Howell alleges that the defendants \u201cengaged in a\n\npolicy, pattern and practice of selectively and vindictively enforcing unlawful decisions against\n\nPlaintiff,\u201d and \u201csegregated Plaintiff from other citizens of the City of Bolivar since they refused\n\nto allow the Plaintiff to appeal the refusal of the issuance of the building permits on two separate\n\noccasions at the City Council meeting.\u201d Howell argues on appeal that it was only during\n\nsubsequent state-court depositions that he \u201clearned for the first time\u201d that \u201che had been treated\n\ndifferently from all other citizens of Hardeman County, Tennessee.\u201d This argument is undercut\n\nby the fact that Howell\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Mayor Stevens on February 26, 2013, arguing\n\nthat \u201cthe City has singled Mr. Howell out for treatment in this regard different than other\n\nsimilarly situated residents.\u201d Given that Howell\u2019s attorney spelled out the terms of his equal-\n\nprotection claim in this letter, Howell clearly had enough information on February 26, 2013, to\n\nknow about the injury forming the basis of his equal-protection claim.\n\n          Because Howell did not bring his federal \u00a7 1983 claims within the one-year time period\n\nset forth in Tennessee\u2019s statute of limitations, the district court was correct to dismiss those\n\nclaims.     Furthermore, because Howell\u2019s federal claims were dismissed, the district court\n\ncorrectly dismissed his state-law claims as well. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). The decision of the\n\ndistrict court is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">               NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FULL-TEXT PUBLICATION\n                          File Name: 16a0381n.06\n\n                                     Case No. 15-6254\n\n                         UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                              FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n                                                                               FILED\n                                                                           Jul 07, 2016\nV.

Farris\n\n\nlimitations, which left the court without supplemental jurisdiction to hear his state-law claims.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n       Howell\u2019s first argument is that a district court may not grant a motion to dismiss based on\n\nthe statute of limitations. Howell cites the magistrate judge\u2019s report in Sanders v. Williams\n\nEquipment & Supply Co., which stated that \u201cthe statute of limitations issue in most cases cannot\n\nbe decided on a motion to dismiss or from the face of a plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\u201d No. 09\u201302281\u2013\n\nA/P, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5575483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (W.D.

The magistrate judge in that case made that statement\n\nin the context of explaining that, as \u201ca general rule, a plaintiff is not required to plead facts\n\nplacing a claim within the limitations period \u2018because the statute of limitations is an affirmative\n\ndefense for which the defendant bears the burden of proof.\u2019\u201d Ibid. (quoting Carrell, 681 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 888). However, the magistrate judge went on to note that the \u201cSixth Circuit has held\n\n. . . that a plaintiff may have an obligation to plead facts in avoidance of the statute of limitations\n\ndefense if \u2018it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the time limit for bringing the\n\nclaim[s] has passed.\u2019\u201d Ibid.

Howell went to the City Council on\n\nJanuary 8, 2013, and on February 12, 2013, and each time the City Council refused to consider\n\nHowell\u2019s request. These denials and refusals are the injuries that form the basis of his federal\n\nconstitutional claims, and as such, he should have known of their existence by February 12,\n\n2013, at the latest. That Howell sought the assistance of an attorney, who drafted a letter to\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fCase No. 15-6254, Howell v. Farris\n\n\nMayor Barrett Stevens dated February 26, 2013, further bolsters this conclusion. In that letter,\n\nHowell\u2019s attorney stated: \u201cIt is my opinion that the City of Bolivar . . . has wrongfully and\n\nunlawfully refused Mr. Howell his requested building permits. . . . For reasons I can not\n\nunderstand, the City singled Mr. Howell out for treatment in this regard different than other\n\nsimilarly situated residents.\u201d This letter suggests that, as of February 26, 2013, Howell was well\n\naware of the injuries underlying his claims. Howell filed his suit on February 10, 2015, nearly\n\ntwo years after that date, which means that his suit is barred by the one-year statute of\n\nlimitations.\n\n       To rebut this conclusion, Howell argues that he discovered the basis of his claims during\n\ndepositions taken in state-court litigation that occurred within one year of the date on which he\n\nfiled his suit. That argument is unpersuasive.\n\n       Howell\u2019s First Amendment claims are based on an alleged deprivation of his rights to\n\n\u201cprotes[t] Defendants\u2019 unlawful treatment of him\u201d and \u201cappeal . . . to the Bolivar City Council.\u201d\n\nHowell alleges that the defendants took \u201cadverse action . . . that would be likely to chill a person\n\nof ordinary fitness when continuing to engage in that activity.\u201d Even if we assume that the\n\ndefendants\u2019 actions did in fact violate Howell\u2019s free-speech rights, Howell would surely have\n\nknown of the injuries when the speech-chilling conduct took place and not at a subsequent\n\ndeposition.\n\n       A similar problem afflicts Howell\u2019s due-process claims. Those claims are based on the\n\ndefendants\u2019 allegedly \u201carbitrar[y] and capriciou[s] deni[al]\u201d of the building permits, and their\n\n\u201crefus[al] to hear Plaintiff\u2019s appeal of the denial of the building permits.\u201d Again, Howell should\n\nhave known of the existence of these injuries at the time they occurred, i.e., when his building\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fCase No. 15-6254, Howell v. Farris\n\n\npermits were allegedly denied without a reasonable basis and when the City Council refused to\n\nhear his requests.\n\n          As for his equal-protection claims, Howell alleges that the defendants \u201cengaged in a\n\npolicy, pattern and practice of selectively and vindictively enforcing unlawful decisions against\n\nPlaintiff,\u201d and \u201csegregated Plaintiff from other citizens of the City of Bolivar since they refused\n\nto allow the Plaintiff to appeal the refusal of the issuance of the building permits on two separate\n\noccasions at the City Council meeting.\u201d Howell argues on appeal that it was only during\n\nsubsequent state-court depositions that he \u201clearned for the first time\u201d that \u201che had been treated\n\ndifferently from all other citizens of Hardeman County, Tennessee.\u201d This argument is undercut\n\nby the fact that Howell\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Mayor Stevens on February 26, 2013, arguing\n\nthat \u201cthe City has singled Mr. Howell out for treatment in this regard different than other\n\nsimilarly situated residents.\u201d Given that Howell\u2019s attorney spelled out the terms of his equal-\n\nprotection claim in this letter, Howell clearly had enough information on February 26, 2013, to\n\nknow about the injury forming the basis of his equal-protection claim.\n\n          Because Howell did not bring his federal \u00a7 1983 claims within the one-year time period\n\nset forth in Tennessee\u2019s statute of limitations, the district court was correct to dismiss those\n\nclaims.     Furthermore, because Howell\u2019s federal claims were dismissed, the district court\n\ncorrectly dismissed his state-law claims as well. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3). The decision of the\n\ndistrict court is therefore AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
