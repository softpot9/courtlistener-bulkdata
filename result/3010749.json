The\nfacts set forth below are taken from the record and, unless\nnoted, are not in dispute, although the exact dates are not\nalways clear. In February 1995, Dorsey and the UAW began\nnegotiating a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)\nbecause the prior CBA was due to expire in March 1995.\nThe primary issues concerned overtime and subcontracting.\nDorsey warned that if no agreement could be reached or if\nthe union were to strike, Dorsey would close the plant. App.\nat 47-49. Negotiations were conducted between February\nand May but the parties were unable to reach agreement on\na new contract.\n\nThe union began a strike on June 26, 1995, to protest\nalleged unfair labor practices of Dorsey. App. at 50. On\nJune 30, 1995, the union filed the first of four unfair labor\npractice charges against the employer. In September 1995,\nDorsey began to negotiate for the purchase of a new plant\nin Cartersville, Georgia, and on October 5, 1995, reached a\nbasic agreement in principle to purchase the plant. App. at\n145-46. It had concluded that it would be to its financial\nbenefit to operate the Georgia plant rather than the\nNorthumberland facility. App. at 138-41. On October 9,\n1995, Dorsey notified the union of its impending purchase\nand its intention to move the Northumberland work there.\nHowever, it also offered to continue to bargain over the\n\"effects of that decision and the decision itself.\" App. at\n189. Thereafter, the union unconditionally offered to come\nback to work but by then Dorsey was seeking substantial\nconcessions. App. at 164. Further negotiations proved\nfruitless. Dorsey described the union's concessions on\novertime as \"too little too late.\" App. at 66; 177.\n\nOn November 9, 1995, Dorsey formally notified the union\nof its decision to close the Northumberland plant and move\n\n                                3\n\fits operations to Georgia. At that time, Dorsey began\nmoving the plant equipment. App. at 181. On November 16,\n1995, the union filed the fourth of its unfair labor charges\nagainst Dorsey alleging that Dorsey improperly transferred\nwork to the Georgia plant. The union asked the Board to\nseek temporary injunctive relief under S 10(j), but the Board\ndid not act on the request at that time. Dorsey shut down\nthe plant on December 29, 1995, and has attempted to sell\nit since then. App. at 252-53.\n\nThere was a lapse in Dorsey's operations resulting from\nthe move, and it began its Georgia operations in March\n1996. When it determined that it could not manufacture at\nthe new plant all of the trucks that it had manufactured at\nNorthumberland, Dorsey decided it would limit its Georgia\nplant to the manufacture of flatbed trailers. In July 1996 it\npurchased a South Carolina facility to build dump trailers,\npreviously manufactured in Northumberland.\n\nDorsey estimates its total costs of moving the\nNorthumberland operations to Georgia and South Carolina\nexceeded $900,000, app. at 197, and the costs of\nmaintaining the closed Northumberland plant for the first\nsix months of 1997 to be $130,000, app. at 198, and that\ncontinued maintenance costs continue to be a terrible\ndrain.\n\nThe Board issued a consolidated complaint in August\n1996 (later amended in October 1996) charging Dorsey with\nnumerous violations of the NLRA, including threatening\nemployees with closure of the plant if the workers called a\nstrike, refusing to provide company information necessary\nfor bargaining, unilaterally implementing a new attendance\npolicy, and refusing to fairly bargain regarding the transfer\nof work to Georgia. Following a three-day trial in November\n1996, the Administrative Law Judge issued a\ncomprehensive fifty-six page decision on December 1, 1997,\nfinding in large part that Dorsey committed the alleged\nunfair labor practices. See ALJ Decision, at 52. The ALJ's\ndecision ordered a remedy that included the restoration of\nthe Northumberland plant. Id. at 54-56. Dorsey filed\nexceptions to the decision on January 29, 1998, and the\nmatter is currently pending before the Board. We were\nadvised that briefing was completed recently.\n\n                               4\n\fAlthough the union had asked the Board to file a request\nfor a S 10(j) injunction as early as November 1995, the\nBoard did not file such a petition with the district court\nuntil January 27, 1997. In its Petition for a S 10(j)\ninjunction, the Board sought to prevent Dorsey from selling\nor alienating the plant before the Board ruled on the merits\nof the underlying unfair labor charges. It sought to\nmaintain the status quo and thereby preserve the remedy\nof restoration should the Board decide to so order.\n\nFollowing a hearing on July 24, 1997, the district court\ndenied the petition request. Although the court found that\nthere was reasonable cause to believe that Dorsey had\ncommitted the unfair labor charges, it also found that\nS 10(j) relief would not be \"just and proper\" because: (1) the\nrequest was untimely made, noting the fourteen-month\ndelay in seeking S 10(j) relief; (2) the maintenance of the\nvacant plant was a cash drain on Dorsey, especially in light\nof the prior expenses of relocation; (3) the workers in\nDorsey's Georgia and South Carolina plants could lose their\njobs should restoration be ordered; (4) the vast majority of\nthe former Northumberland workers had found new jobs;\n(5) the sale of the plant would bring new jobs to the region;\nand (6) the Board could order Dorsey to build a new plant\nand employ the Northumberland workers, if the plant were\nsold.\n\nII.\n\nA district court's determination whether to issue\ntemporary injunctive relief under S 10(j) involves a two-fold\ninquiry: (1) whether there is reasonable cause to believe\nthat an unfair labor practice has occurred; and (2) whether\nan injunction would be just and proper.

Because Dorsey does not\ndispute the district court's finding that the Board has\nsatisfied the \"reasonable cause\" inquiry, the only question\nis whether the Board demonstrated that the issuance of an\ninjunction would be \"just and proper.\"\n\n                               5\n\fThe standard to be applied by a district court in\ndetermining whether granting temporary relief pursuant to\nS 10(j) is just and proper should be informed by the policies\nunderlying S 10(j). See Lenape Products, 781 F.2d at 1003;\nSuburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1090-91. \"Congress sought to\nensure that the Board would be able to exercise effectively\nits ultimate remedial power.\" Lenape Products, 781 F.2d at\n1003. Section 10(j) \"was designed to enable the Labor\nBoard to vindicate its ultimate remedial power by affording\nlimited interim relief in instances where the passage of time\nreasonably necessary to adjudicate the case on its merits\nconvinced both the Board and the federal courts that the\nfailure to grant such relief might dissipate the effective\nexercise of such power.\" Suburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1091.\nThus, the focus in a S 10(j) determination is on the public\ninterest, Vibra Screw, 904 F.2d at 876, and\"the unusual\nlikelihood . . . of ultimate remedial failure\" by the NLRB.\nSuburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1091 n.26 (emphasis in\noriginal). \"The public interest at stake is the promotion of\nwholesome and mutually acceptable labor relations and the\nsettlement of labor disputes through collective bargaining\nbetween employees and their employer.\" Vibra Screw, 904\nF.2d at 876 (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn evaluating whether to issue an injunction under the\n\"just and proper\" prong, a district court\"should discuss\nand determine whether the failure to grant interim\ninjunctive relief would be likely to prevent the Board, acting\nwith reasonable expedition, from effectively exercising its\nultimate remedial powers.\" Suburban Lines, 731 F.2d at\n1091-92. \"[T]he critical determination is whether, absent an\ninjunction, the Board's ability to facilitate peaceful\nmanagement-labor negotiation will be impaired.\" Vibra\nScrew, 904 F.2d at 879.

The S 10(j) analysis must be guided by the particular\n\n                               6\n\ffacts in each case. See Eisenberg v. Hartz Mountain Corp.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328762\"><a href=\"/opinion/328762/arthur-eisenberg-regional-director-of-the-twenty-second-region-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 142 (3d Cir. 1975).\n\nThe Board argues that the failure to issue the injunction\nin this case clearly impairs the \"Board's ability to facilitate\npeaceful management-labor negotiation,\" Vibra Screw, 904\nF.2d at 879, because, absent an injunction, Dorsey could\nsell the plant before the Board rules upon the unfair labor\ncharges. This would render the Board's ultimate remedial\npowers toothless. The ALJ has already determined that\nrestoration of the plant is a proper remedy. Although\nDorsey argues that restoration is not a proper remedy\nunder these circumstances, but see Coronet Foods, Inc. v.\nNLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597103\"><a href=\"/opinion/597103/coronet-foods-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1993) (court, per then\nJudge, now Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, enforced Board\norder requiring employer to restore trucking department),\nwe need not decide that issue now. Instead, this appeal\nconcerns the district court's exercise of its discretion. It is\nevident to us that the district court's failure to grant\ninterim injunctive relief to ensure the availability of the\nplant jeopardizes the Board's ability to effectively exercise\nits ultimate remedial powers. The alienation of the plant by\nDorsey would eliminate that remedy entirely. Under the\nstandards articulated in Suburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1091-\n92, this risk is sufficient to satisfy the \"just and proper\"\nprong for injunctive relief.\n\nIn addition, in denying injunctive relief, the district court\nrelied upon its belief that the Board has the power to order\nDorsey to build a new plant if the Board determined that\nrestoration of the Northumberland plant was the proper\nremedy for the unfair labor charges. Dorsey cites no legal\nsupport, and significantly the Board argues it does not have\nsuch wide power. It is at least plausible that had the\ndistrict court recognized that it was likely that a restoration\nremedy would be unavailable absent an injunction, the\ndistrict court may have been persuaded to issue the interim\nrelief.\n\nAnother basis for the district court's opinion, that a vast\nmajority of the workers from the Northumberland plant had\nfound new jobs, is unsupported on this record. This\nconclusion was taken from a newspaper article that itself\nspeculates as to this figure. Dorsey's counsel conceded at\n\n                                7\n\foral argument that it neither presented nor has any\nevidence of the number of its former employees who are no\nlonger available. Even if the district court's conclusion were\naccurate, there is no information whether the new jobs and\npay are comparable. In any event, the possible employment\nof the former employees does not mitigate the need for a\nS 10(j) injunction.\n\nMoreover, the district court's denial of relief emphasized\nthe cash drain and financial burden of maintenance of the\nNorthumberland plant, and notes the negative impact\ncaused by the relocation. This fails to take into account\nthat the impact was of Dorsey's making. The Board's\ncounsel points to evidence that shows that the burden is\nminor for a company of Dorsey's income and assets. Also\nsignificant in that respect is that in this circuit a S 10(j)\ninjunction is limited to six months when a matter is\npending before the Board. See Hartz Mountain, 519 F.2d at\n144.\n\nFinally, although we recognize that the Board did not\npetition for a S 10(j) injunction as early as it might have, the\ndelay should not be dispositive in determining whether to\ngrant injunctive relief. The district court acknowledged that\n\"delay alone is not grounds for denying an injunction,\" op.\nat 10, but it is unclear whether its concern over the delay\ninfluenced the court's rejection of the injunction. Dorsey\nmoved quickly from its decision to move the operations in\nthe fall of 1995, to the closure of the plant on December 29,\n1995. Even if the Board had not delayed until January\n1997 to file the S10(j) petition, it is unlikely that it would\nhave been able to seek the injunction and obtain a hearing\nbefore the equipment had been transferred and the plant\nclosed. As we noted in Vibra Screw, \"The Board needs time\nto do a thorough investigation before it even requests the\n[S 10(j)] injunction.\" 904 F.2d at 881.

See Hartz Mountain , 519 F.2d at\n144. Indeed, the Board has adopted a regulation requiring\nit to hear expeditiously and give priority to a complaint\nwhich is the subject of a S 10(j) injunction. See 29 C.F.R.\nS 102.94.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the reasons set forth, we will remand this case and\ndirect the district court to order interim relief under S10(j).1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Although we do not preclude Dorsey from raising on remand the\nappropriate starting date of the S 10(j) injunction, it is important to\nnote\nthat it never raised that issue in its brief. Our concurring colleague\nsuggests that the Board has already obtained the relief it is seeking\nthrough the S 10(j) injunction. In fact, that has not occurred as the\nunion and the former employees have not received the benefit of the\nBoard's expedited consideration that occurs upon issuance of a S 10(j)\ninjunction.\n\n                               9\n\fGREENBERG, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\nI join in the majority opinion but point out the following.\nThe Board seeks an injunction to prevent Dorsey from\nselling or alienating the plant before the Board rules on the\nmerits of the unfair labor charges. If the district court had\nentered the injunction on August 26, 1997, when it instead\ndenied it, the injunction already would have expired under\nthe six-month limitation rule we adopted in Eisenberg v.\nHartz Mountain Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328762\"><a href=\"/opinion/328762/arthur-eisenberg-regional-director-of-the-twenty-second-region-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 144 (3d Cir. 1975). Of\ncourse, in that circumstance the Board would have been\nrequired to hear the unfair labor practices complaint before\nit expeditiously on a priority basis.\n\nIn fact, it is undisputed that Dorsey shut down the plant\non December 29, 1995; and while it has attempted to sell\nthe facility, it has been unable to do so. Moreover, its\ninability to sell the plant has been attributable at least in\npart to the Board's intervention, as the Board notified a\npotential purchaser that if it acquired the plant it might\nincur successor liability for Dorsey's alleged unfair labor\npractices. The notification understandably led to the\npotential sale collapsing. In reality, therefore, the mere fact\nthat the Board brought the unfair labor practices charge\nhas acted as a lis pendens on the property. Thus, even\nwithout an injunction having been entered, the status quo\nwith respect to the alienation of the plant has been\nmaintained for a period almost five-fold that which in Hartz\nMountain we held could be required.\n\nThe majority indicates that its opinion does \"not preclude\nDorsey from raising on remand the appropriate starting\ndate of the S 10(j) injunction.\" Slip op. at 9 n.1. I, of course,\nagree. I write separately merely to emphasize that as I\nunderstand the majority's opinion it does not preclude\nDorsey from arguing that the starting date should be\nAugust 26, 1997, so that the injunction already has\nexpired. After all, the Board in a sense already has obtained\nthe relief it is seeking in these proceedings.

Hirsch, Director of Region Four, on\nbehalf of the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\" or\n\"the Board\"), appeals from the district court's order denying\na temporary injunction under S 10(j) of the National Labor\nRelations Act (\"NLRA\"), codified at 29 U.S.C. S 160(j). The\ninjunction was sought pending the resolution by the NLRB\nof unfair labor practice charges against appellee Dorsey\nTrailers Inc. The district court concluded that a S 10(j)\ninjunction would not be \"just and proper,\" the statutory\nstandard for an injunction under the NLRA. The Board\ntimely appealed. The International Union of United\nAutomobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers\nof America, Local 1868 (\"UAW\" or \"the union\"), which is the\nbargaining representative of the workers affected by the\ndenial of injunctive relief, has filed a brief amicus curiae in\nsupport of the Board's appeal.\n\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. S 1291, 1292(a)(1)\nand 29 U.S.C. S 160(j). Our review of the denial of a S 10(j)\ninjunction is for abuse of discretion, see Eisenberg v.\nLenape Products, Inc., 781 F.2d 999, 1003 (3d Cir. 1986),\nand we have held we may reverse the denial of a S 10(j)\n\n                                2\n\finjunction if the factual findings do not \"substantially relate\nto the conclusion reached\" by the district court. Kobell v.\nSuburban Lines, Inc., 731 F.2d 1076, 1092 (3d Cir. 1984).\n\nI.\n\nThis appeal centers on the circumstances surrounding\nthe December 1995 closure of a plant in Northumberland,\nPennsylvania, that once employed 200 UAW workers who\nmanufactured dump and flatbed trailers for Dorsey. The\nfacts set forth below are taken from the record and, unless\nnoted, are not in dispute, although the exact dates are not\nalways clear. In February 1995, Dorsey and the UAW began\nnegotiating a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)\nbecause the prior CBA was due to expire in March 1995.\nThe primary issues concerned overtime and subcontracting.\nDorsey warned that if no agreement could be reached or if\nthe union were to strike, Dorsey would close the plant. App.\nat 47-49. Negotiations were conducted between February\nand May but the parties were unable to reach agreement on\na new contract.\n\nThe union began a strike on June 26, 1995, to protest\nalleged unfair labor practices of Dorsey. App. at 50. On\nJune 30, 1995, the union filed the first of four unfair labor\npractice charges against the employer. In September 1995,\nDorsey began to negotiate for the purchase of a new plant\nin Cartersville, Georgia, and on October 5, 1995, reached a\nbasic agreement in principle to purchase the plant. App. at\n145-46. It had concluded that it would be to its financial\nbenefit to operate the Georgia plant rather than the\nNorthumberland facility. App. at 138-41. On October 9,\n1995, Dorsey notified the union of its impending purchase\nand its intention to move the Northumberland work there.\nHowever, it also offered to continue to bargain over the\n\"effects of that decision and the decision itself.\" App. at\n189. Thereafter, the union unconditionally offered to come\nback to work but by then Dorsey was seeking substantial\nconcessions. App. at 164. Further negotiations proved\nfruitless. Dorsey described the union's concessions on\novertime as \"too little too late.\" App. at 66; 177.\n\nOn November 9, 1995, Dorsey formally notified the union\nof its decision to close the Northumberland plant and move\n\n                                3\n\fits operations to Georgia. At that time, Dorsey began\nmoving the plant equipment. App. at 181. On November 16,\n1995, the union filed the fourth of its unfair labor charges\nagainst Dorsey alleging that Dorsey improperly transferred\nwork to the Georgia plant. The union asked the Board to\nseek temporary injunctive relief under S 10(j), but the Board\ndid not act on the request at that time. Dorsey shut down\nthe plant on December 29, 1995, and has attempted to sell\nit since then. App. at 252-53.\n\nThere was a lapse in Dorsey's operations resulting from\nthe move, and it began its Georgia operations in March\n1996. When it determined that it could not manufacture at\nthe new plant all of the trucks that it had manufactured at\nNorthumberland, Dorsey decided it would limit its Georgia\nplant to the manufacture of flatbed trailers. In July 1996 it\npurchased a South Carolina facility to build dump trailers,\npreviously manufactured in Northumberland.\n\nDorsey estimates its total costs of moving the\nNorthumberland operations to Georgia and South Carolina\nexceeded $900,000, app. at 197, and the costs of\nmaintaining the closed Northumberland plant for the first\nsix months of 1997 to be $130,000, app. at 198, and that\ncontinued maintenance costs continue to be a terrible\ndrain.\n\nThe Board issued a consolidated complaint in August\n1996 (later amended in October 1996) charging Dorsey with\nnumerous violations of the NLRA, including threatening\nemployees with closure of the plant if the workers called a\nstrike, refusing to provide company information necessary\nfor bargaining, unilaterally implementing a new attendance\npolicy, and refusing to fairly bargain regarding the transfer\nof work to Georgia. Following a three-day trial in November\n1996, the Administrative Law Judge issued a\ncomprehensive fifty-six page decision on December 1, 1997,\nfinding in large part that Dorsey committed the alleged\nunfair labor practices. See ALJ Decision, at 52. The ALJ's\ndecision ordered a remedy that included the restoration of\nthe Northumberland plant. Id. at 54-56. Dorsey filed\nexceptions to the decision on January 29, 1998, and the\nmatter is currently pending before the Board. We were\nadvised that briefing was completed recently.\n\n                               4\n\fAlthough the union had asked the Board to file a request\nfor a S 10(j) injunction as early as November 1995, the\nBoard did not file such a petition with the district court\nuntil January 27, 1997. In its Petition for a S 10(j)\ninjunction, the Board sought to prevent Dorsey from selling\nor alienating the plant before the Board ruled on the merits\nof the underlying unfair labor charges. It sought to\nmaintain the status quo and thereby preserve the remedy\nof restoration should the Board decide to so order.\n\nFollowing a hearing on July 24, 1997, the district court\ndenied the petition request. Although the court found that\nthere was reasonable cause to believe that Dorsey had\ncommitted the unfair labor charges, it also found that\nS 10(j) relief would not be \"just and proper\" because: (1) the\nrequest was untimely made, noting the fourteen-month\ndelay in seeking S 10(j) relief; (2) the maintenance of the\nvacant plant was a cash drain on Dorsey, especially in light\nof the prior expenses of relocation; (3) the workers in\nDorsey's Georgia and South Carolina plants could lose their\njobs should restoration be ordered; (4) the vast majority of\nthe former Northumberland workers had found new jobs;\n(5) the sale of the plant would bring new jobs to the region;\nand (6) the Board could order Dorsey to build a new plant\nand employ the Northumberland workers, if the plant were\nsold.\n\nII.\n\nA district court's determination whether to issue\ntemporary injunctive relief under S 10(j) involves a two-fold\ninquiry: (1) whether there is reasonable cause to believe\nthat an unfair labor practice has occurred; and (2) whether\nan injunction would be just and proper. See Pascarell v.\nVibra Screw Inc., 904 F.2d 874, 877 (3d Cir. 1990) (citation\nomitted); Suburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1078 (interim relief\nunder S 10(j) may be granted without showing irreparable\nharm or a likelihood of success on the merits, the ordinary\nrequisites of an injunction). Because Dorsey does not\ndispute the district court's finding that the Board has\nsatisfied the \"reasonable cause\" inquiry, the only question\nis whether the Board demonstrated that the issuance of an\ninjunction would be \"just and proper.\"\n\n                               5\n\fThe standard to be applied by a district court in\ndetermining whether granting temporary relief pursuant to\nS 10(j) is just and proper should be informed by the policies\nunderlying S 10(j). See Lenape Products, 781 F.2d at 1003;\nSuburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1090-91. \"Congress sought to\nensure that the Board would be able to exercise effectively\nits ultimate remedial power.\" Lenape Products, 781 F.2d at\n1003. Section 10(j) \"was designed to enable the Labor\nBoard to vindicate its ultimate remedial power by affording\nlimited interim relief in instances where the passage of time\nreasonably necessary to adjudicate the case on its merits\nconvinced both the Board and the federal courts that the\nfailure to grant such relief might dissipate the effective\nexercise of such power.\" Suburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1091.\nThus, the focus in a S 10(j) determination is on the public\ninterest, Vibra Screw, 904 F.2d at 876, and\"the unusual\nlikelihood . . . of ultimate remedial failure\" by the NLRB.\nSuburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1091 n.26 (emphasis in\noriginal). \"The public interest at stake is the promotion of\nwholesome and mutually acceptable labor relations and the\nsettlement of labor disputes through collective bargaining\nbetween employees and their employer.\" Vibra Screw, 904\nF.2d at 876 (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\nIn evaluating whether to issue an injunction under the\n\"just and proper\" prong, a district court\"should discuss\nand determine whether the failure to grant interim\ninjunctive relief would be likely to prevent the Board, acting\nwith reasonable expedition, from effectively exercising its\nultimate remedial powers.\" Suburban Lines, 731 F.2d at\n1091-92. \"[T]he critical determination is whether, absent an\ninjunction, the Board's ability to facilitate peaceful\nmanagement-labor negotiation will be impaired.\" Vibra\nScrew, 904 F.2d at 879. This requires an assessment of\n\"the likelihood of harm to the bargaining process\" absent\nan injunction. Eisenberg v. Wellington Hall Nursing Home,\nInc., 651 F.2d 902, 907 (3d Cir. 1981). \"Unless there are\ncircumstances, like the size, intimacy and longevity of the\nbargaining unit, which indicate that the bargaining process\nwill not be harmed, courts must be deferential to the\nBoard's determination that the integrity of the process\nneeds interim protection.\" Vibra Screw, 904 F.2d at 879\nn.7. The S 10(j) analysis must be guided by the particular\n\n                               6\n\ffacts in each case. See Eisenberg v. Hartz Mountain Corp.,\n519 F.2d 138, 142 (3d Cir. 1975).\n\nThe Board argues that the failure to issue the injunction\nin this case clearly impairs the \"Board's ability to facilitate\npeaceful management-labor negotiation,\" Vibra Screw, 904\nF.2d at 879, because, absent an injunction, Dorsey could\nsell the plant before the Board rules upon the unfair labor\ncharges. This would render the Board's ultimate remedial\npowers toothless. The ALJ has already determined that\nrestoration of the plant is a proper remedy. Although\nDorsey argues that restoration is not a proper remedy\nunder these circumstances, but see Coronet Foods, Inc. v.\nNLRB, 981 F.2d 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (court, per then\nJudge, now Justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, enforced Board\norder requiring employer to restore trucking department),\nwe need not decide that issue now. Instead, this appeal\nconcerns the district court's exercise of its discretion. It is\nevident to us that the district court's failure to grant\ninterim injunctive relief to ensure the availability of the\nplant jeopardizes the Board's ability to effectively exercise\nits ultimate remedial powers. The alienation of the plant by\nDorsey would eliminate that remedy entirely. Under the\nstandards articulated in Suburban Lines, 731 F.2d at 1091-\n92, this risk is sufficient to satisfy the \"just and proper\"\nprong for injunctive relief.\n\nIn addition, in denying injunctive relief, the district court\nrelied upon its belief that the Board has the power to order\nDorsey to build a new plant if the Board determined that\nrestoration of the Northumberland plant was the proper\nremedy for the unfair labor charges. Dorsey cites no legal\nsupport, and significantly the Board argues it does not have\nsuch wide power. It is at least plausible that had the\ndistrict court recognized that it was likely that a restoration\nremedy would be unavailable absent an injunction, the\ndistrict court may have been persuaded to issue the interim\nrelief.\n\nAnother basis for the district court's opinion, that a vast\nmajority of the workers from the Northumberland plant had\nfound new jobs, is unsupported on this record. This\nconclusion was taken from a newspaper article that itself\nspeculates as to this figure. Dorsey's counsel conceded at\n\n                                7\n\foral argument that it neither presented nor has any\nevidence of the number of its former employees who are no\nlonger available. Even if the district court's conclusion were\naccurate, there is no information whether the new jobs and\npay are comparable. In any event, the possible employment\nof the former employees does not mitigate the need for a\nS 10(j) injunction.\n\nMoreover, the district court's denial of relief emphasized\nthe cash drain and financial burden of maintenance of the\nNorthumberland plant, and notes the negative impact\ncaused by the relocation. This fails to take into account\nthat the impact was of Dorsey's making. The Board's\ncounsel points to evidence that shows that the burden is\nminor for a company of Dorsey's income and assets. Also\nsignificant in that respect is that in this circuit a S 10(j)\ninjunction is limited to six months when a matter is\npending before the Board. See Hartz Mountain, 519 F.2d at\n144.\n\nFinally, although we recognize that the Board did not\npetition for a S 10(j) injunction as early as it might have, the\ndelay should not be dispositive in determining whether to\ngrant injunctive relief. The district court acknowledged that\n\"delay alone is not grounds for denying an injunction,\" op.\nat 10, but it is unclear whether its concern over the delay\ninfluenced the court's rejection of the injunction. Dorsey\nmoved quickly from its decision to move the operations in\nthe fall of 1995, to the closure of the plant on December 29,\n1995. Even if the Board had not delayed until January\n1997 to file the S10(j) petition, it is unlikely that it would\nhave been able to seek the injunction and obtain a hearing\nbefore the equipment had been transferred and the plant\nclosed. As we noted in Vibra Screw, \"The Board needs time\nto do a thorough investigation before it even requests the\n[S 10(j)] injunction.\" 904 F.2d at 881. See also Aguayo v.\nTomco Carburetor Co., 853 F.2d 744, 750 (9th Cir. 1988)\n(delay is only significant if the harm has occurred and the\nparties cannot be returned to the status quo; the Board\nneeds a reasonable period of time to investigate and\ndeliberate before it decides to bring a section 10(j) action)\noverruled on other grounds, Miller v. California Pacific Med.\nCtr., 19 F.3d 449, 457 (9th Cir. 1994).\n\n                               8\n\fAlthough the protracted delay is not entirely justified, it\nis insufficient under these facts to overcome the primary\nconsideration in evaluating the just and proper standard:\nthat of safeguarding the Board's remedial powers. Using the\nBoard's delay as the basis to deny the requested injunctive\nrelief punishes the wronged employees for the Board's\nbelated action, an unacceptable outcome. See Gottfried v.\nMayco Plastics, 472 F. Supp. 1161, 1168 (E.D. Mich. 1979),\naff 'd, 615 F.2d 1360 (6th Cir. 1980). Cf. NLRB v. J.H.\nRutter-Rex Mfg. Co., 396 U.S. 258, 264-65 (1969) (\"the\nBoard is not required to place the consequences of its own\ndelay, even if inordinate, upon wronged employees to the\nbenefit of wrongdoing employers\").\n\nDuring the oral argument counsel for the Board advised\nthis court that the issuance of a S 10(j) injunction\ninvariably prompts the Board to review the ALJ decision on\nappeal because the Board is aware of the limited six-month\nduration of the injunction. See Hartz Mountain , 519 F.2d at\n144. Indeed, the Board has adopted a regulation requiring\nit to hear expeditiously and give priority to a complaint\nwhich is the subject of a S 10(j) injunction. See 29 C.F.R.\nS 102.94.\n\nIII.\n\nFor the reasons set forth, we will remand this case and\ndirect the district court to order interim relief under S10(j).1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Although we do not preclude Dorsey from raising on remand the\nappropriate starting date of the S 10(j) injunction, it is important to\nnote\nthat it never raised that issue in its brief. Our concurring colleague\nsuggests that the Board has already obtained the relief it is seeking\nthrough the S 10(j) injunction. In fact, that has not occurred as the\nunion and the former employees have not received the benefit of the\nBoard's expedited consideration that occurs upon issuance of a S 10(j)\ninjunction.\n\n                               9\n\fGREENBERG, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\nI join in the majority opinion but point out the following.\nThe Board seeks an injunction to prevent Dorsey from\nselling or alienating the plant before the Board rules on the\nmerits of the unfair labor charges. If the district court had\nentered the injunction on August 26, 1997, when it instead\ndenied it, the injunction already would have expired under\nthe six-month limitation rule we adopted in Eisenberg v.\nHartz Mountain Corp., 519 F.2d 138, 144 (3d Cir. 1975). Of\ncourse, in that circumstance the Board would have been\nrequired to hear the unfair labor practices complaint before\nit expeditiously on a priority basis.\n\nIn fact, it is undisputed that Dorsey shut down the plant\non December 29, 1995; and while it has attempted to sell\nthe facility, it has been unable to do so. Moreover, its\ninability to sell the plant has been attributable at least in\npart to the Board's intervention, as the Board notified a\npotential purchaser that if it acquired the plant it might\nincur successor liability for Dorsey's alleged unfair labor\npractices. The notification understandably led to the\npotential sale collapsing. In reality, therefore, the mere fact\nthat the Board brought the unfair labor practices charge\nhas acted as a lis pendens on the property. Thus, even\nwithout an injunction having been entered, the status quo\nwith respect to the alienation of the plant has been\nmaintained for a period almost five-fold that which in Hartz\nMountain we held could be required.\n\nThe majority indicates that its opinion does \"not preclude\nDorsey from raising on remand the appropriate starting\ndate of the S 10(j) injunction.\" Slip op. at 9 n.1. I, of course,\nagree. I write separately merely to emphasize that as I\nunderstand the majority's opinion it does not preclude\nDorsey from arguing that the starting date should be\nAugust 26, 1997, so that the injunction already has\nexpired. After all, the Board in a sense already has obtained\nthe relief it is seeking in these proceedings. I, however, do\nnot explore the point further as the parties have not briefed\nthe starting date issue on this appeal.\n\n                               10\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               11\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "4440665de621ae37004add38ad4c5c16469bdbce", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/328762/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/375161/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/391373/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/433801/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/463487/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/542865/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/597103/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/665849/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2124054/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2015-10-13T20:55:08.495753Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 12, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/3010749/hirsch-v-dorsey-trailers-inc/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "3010749", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Hirsch v.
