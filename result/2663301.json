Graves (\u201cGraves\u201d) brings this employment discrimination action\n\nagainst Defendant, the District of Columbia (the \u201cDistrict\u201d), under Title VII of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (\u201cSection 1981\u201d), claiming that he was subjected to a racially hostile work\n\nenvironment during the course of his two-decade career with the District\u2019s Fire and Emergency\n\nServices Department. The action is now in the pretrial stage of litigation and there is a single\n\nmotion before the Court: the District\u2019s [38] Motion in Limine. Upon consideration of the\n\nparties\u2019 submissions, the relevant authorities, and the record as a whole, the motion shall be\n\nGRANTED-IN-PART and HELD-IN-ABEYANCE-IN-PART.1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          While the Court renders its decision today on the record as a whole, its consideration\nhas focused on the following documents, listed in chronological order of their filing: Mem. of P.\n& A. in Supp. of Def.

In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument on the motion\nwould not assist the Court in rendering its decision at this time. See LCV R 7(f).\n\f                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Graves, who self-identifies as an individual of \u201cmixed race,\u201d was formerly employed by\n\nthe District\u2019s Fire and Emergency Services Department. Over the course of his two-decade\n\ncareer, which extended from September 5, 1985 through February 12, 2006, he held a variety of\n\npositions and worked at a number of locations. In this action, Graves contends that he was\n\nsubjected to a racially hostile work environment throughout his career.\n\n       During the course of discovery, Graves identified a total of eighty-one separate incidents\n\nas the component acts comprising the alleged hostile work environment at issue. See Pl.\u2019s Resps.\n\nto Interrogs., ECF No. [24-1], \u00b6 12; Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Resps. to Interrogs., ECF No. [24-2], \u00b6 12.\n\nAccording to Graves, the first contributing incident occurred within days of his hiring, on or\n\nabout September 19, 1985, and the final contributing incident occurred shortly before the\n\ntermination of his employment, on or about September 18, 2005. The eighty-one incidents he\n\nhas identified are of a wide variety and cut a broad swath: some involve physical violence; others\n\ninvolve facially discriminatory comments by subordinates, co-workers, and supervisors; and still\n\nothers involve allegedly punitive assignments or unjustified disciplinary actions. Together, they\n\nimplicate literally dozens of actors working at various locations.\n\n       Graves commenced this action on January 22, 2007. See Compl., ECF No. [1].\n\nFollowing the conclusion of discovery, the District filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which\n\nfocused in large part on the timeliness of Graves\u2019 suit. See Def. District of Columbia\u2019s Mot. for\n\nSumm. J., ECF No. [20]. The Court denied the District\u2019s motion on April 14, 2011. See Graves\n\nv. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2473819\"><a href=\"/opinion/2473819/graves-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.D.C. 2011). In so doing, the Court highlighted\n\nseveral deficiencies in the District\u2019s approach. Most importantly, \u201cnearly all of the arguments\n\n\n                                                 2\n\ftendered by the District in support of its motion [were] premised, at least to some degree, on the\n\nerroneous assumption that Graves intend[ed] to pursue individual claims of discrimination for\n\neach of the employment-related incidents identified in his Complaint.\u201d Id. at 111. However,\n\nGraves \u201cmade it clear that he only intends to pursue two factually coextensive hostile work\n\nenvironment claims in this action, one arising under Title VII and a second arising under Section\n\n1981, and he expressly disavow[ed] an intention to pursue individual claims of discrimination for\n\neach separate incident contributing to the allegedly hostile work environment.\u201d Id. \u201cAs a result,\n\nthe vast majority of the District\u2019s motion [spoke] to claims that simply are not at issue in this\n\naction.\u201d Id. Similarly problematic, of the \u201ceighty-one incidents that collectively comprise the\n\nhostile work environment allegedly suffered by Graves during his employment, only a handful\n\nreceive[d] even passing mention in the District\u2019s moving papers,\u201d which left \u201caltogether\n\nunaddressed over seventy [] incidents that Graves identified as part of his hostile work\n\nenvironment claim during the course of discovery.\u201d Id. \u201c[H]aving failed to account for all or\n\neven a majority of these incidents, the District\u2019s motion [did] not speak to the totality of the\n\nhostile work environment allegedly suffered by Graves.\u201d Id. In short, the District\u2019s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment was woefully inadequate to challenge the sufficiency of Graves\u2019 hostile\n\nwork environment claims.\n\n       Upon the resolution of the District\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court and the\n\nparties proceeded to the pretrial stage of litigation. In order to \u201cnarrow the evidentiary issues at\n\ntrial,\u201d the Court authorized the parties to file motions in limine. Pretrial Scheduling and\n\nProcedures Order (Aug. 18, 2011), ECF No. [37], at 6. The District filed the instant Motion in\n\nLimine on October 7, 2011. Graves filed his opposition on November 3, 2011. The District filed\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fits reply on November 21, 2011.\n\n                                    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       Although neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor the Federal Rules of Evidence\n\nexpressly contemplate motions in limine, the practice of allowing such motions has developed\n\nover time \u201cpursuant to the district court\u2019s inherent authority to manage the course of trials.\u201d Luce\n\nv.

DISCUSSION\n\n       Through its [38] Motion in Limine, the District asks the Court to preclude Graves from\n\nintroducing evidence at trial concerning a total of forty-four of the eighty-one component acts\n\nthat he originally identified as supporting his hostile work environment claims in the course of\n\ndiscovery. Of these forty-four acts, Graves represents that he will not seek to introduce evidence\n\nconcerning a total of twenty-eight. See infra Part III.A. As for the sixteen acts that still remain at\n\nissue, the Court shall require Graves to make an offer of proof demonstrating that there is a\n\nfactual basis for the trier of fact to infer that the incidents were motivated by a discriminatory\n\nanimus and are part of the same hostile work environment.

See Def.\u2019s Mem. at 5. To\n\nprevail on a claim for hostile work environment, a plaintiff must establish that his \u201cworkplace is\n\npermeated with \u2018discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult\u2019 that is \u2018sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment.\u2019\u201d Harris v.

Presented with these arguments,\n\nthe Court is mindful that motions in limine are designed to address discrete evidentiary issues\n\nrelated to trial and are not a vehicle for resolving factual disputes or testing the sufficiency of the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s evidence. See supra Part II. In this regard, the Court is concerned that the District\u2019s\n\nmotion falls on the wrong side of the line between a proper motion in limine and a disguised\n\nmotion for summary judgment. However, before reaching this issue, there is a threshold matter\n\nthat should first be addressed. In this case, the factual record \u201chas been so poorly developed by\n\nthe parties that the Court frankly knows very little about the factual circumstances surrounding\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fthe component acts comprising Graves\u2019 hostile work environment claim[s].\u201d Graves, 777 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 122. That observation, first made in the context of resolving the District\u2019s Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment, holds no less true today. Simply put, the factual record is so skeletal and\n\nincomplete that it is nearly impossible for the Court to determine whether the District\u2019s\n\narguments are amenable to resolution on a motion in limine.\n\n        When the probative value of evidence is called into doubt at the motions in limine stage,\n\nthe trial judge may exercise her discretion to require the proponent to make an offer of proof in\n\nadvance of trial.

In this case, given the sparse factual record created by the\n\nparties, the Court considers it prudent to exercise its discretion to require Graves to make an offer\n\nof proof as to the sixteen component acts that remain at issue. Indeed, based on its past\n\nexperience with pretrial matters, the Court is mindful that knowing the factual predicate for a\n\nparty\u2019s claims is essential to evaluating any objections to anticipated witnesses and exhibits. In\n\nother words, even separate and apart from the District\u2019s Motion in Limine, the Court is confident\n\nthat requiring Graves to make an offer of proof will assist both the Court and the parties in\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fevaluating the Joint Pretrial Statement and associated objections, which are due to be filed with\n\nthe Court on January 10, 2012.\n\n        Accordingly, for each of the following sixteen acts, Graves must make an offer of proof\n\ndemonstrating that there is a factual basis for the trier of fact to infer that the incident was (1)\n\nmotivated by a discriminatory animus and (2) part of the same hostile work environment:\n\n                (1)     Incident No. 11 \u2014 Approx. 1987;\n\n                (2)     Incident No. 18 \u2014 Dec. 20, 1989;\n\n                (3)     Incident No. 19 \u2014 May 8, 1990;\n\n                (4)     Incident No. 20 \u2014 May 10, 1990;\n\n                (5)     Incident No. 21 \u2014 May 11, 1990;\n\n                (6)     Incident No. 22 \u2014 July 15, 1990;\n\n                (7)     Incident No. 34 \u2014 July 19, 1997;\n\n                (8)     Incident No. 35 \u2014 Jan. 17, 1998;\n\n                (9)     Incident No. 37 \u2014 Oct. 13, 1997;\n\n                (10)    Incident No. 48 \u2014 Dec. 19, 1999;\n\n                (11)    Incident No. 49 \u2014 Dec. 1999;\n\n                (12)    Incident No. 61 \u2014 Mar. 10. 2003;\n\n                (13)    Incident No. 65 \u2014 Approx. 2004;4\n\n\n        4\n           The Court notes that the District argues that this incident (Incident No. 65 \u2014 Approx.\n2004) cannot be considered as part of an actionable hostile work environment because it does not\ninvolve something that Graves personally experienced. See Def.\u2019s Mem. at 10; Def.\u2019s Reply at 3.\nFrom his opposition, it is unclear whether Graves even intends to claim that the trier of fact\nshould consider the incident as part of his hostile work environment or whether he instead merely\nsees it as evidence of the District\u2019s knowledge. See Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 10.

Graves (\u201cGraves\u201d) brings this employment discrimination action\n\nagainst Defendant, the District of Columbia (the \u201cDistrict\u201d), under Title VII of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq. (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), and \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (\u201cSection 1981\u201d), claiming that he was subjected to a racially hostile work\n\nenvironment during the course of his two-decade career with the District\u2019s Fire and Emergency\n\nServices Department. The action is now in the pretrial stage of litigation and there is a single\n\nmotion before the Court: the District\u2019s [38] Motion in Limine. Upon consideration of the\n\nparties\u2019 submissions, the relevant authorities, and the record as a whole, the motion shall be\n\nGRANTED-IN-PART and HELD-IN-ABEYANCE-IN-PART.1\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          While the Court renders its decision today on the record as a whole, its consideration\nhas focused on the following documents, listed in chronological order of their filing: Mem. of P.\n& A. in Supp. of Def.

In an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument on the motion\nwould not assist the Court in rendering its decision at this time. See LCV R 7(f).\n\f                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Graves, who self-identifies as an individual of \u201cmixed race,\u201d was formerly employed by\n\nthe District\u2019s Fire and Emergency Services Department. Over the course of his two-decade\n\ncareer, which extended from September 5, 1985 through February 12, 2006, he held a variety of\n\npositions and worked at a number of locations. In this action, Graves contends that he was\n\nsubjected to a racially hostile work environment throughout his career.\n\n       During the course of discovery, Graves identified a total of eighty-one separate incidents\n\nas the component acts comprising the alleged hostile work environment at issue. See Pl.\u2019s Resps.\n\nto Interrogs., ECF No. [24-1], \u00b6 12; Pl.\u2019s Suppl. Resps. to Interrogs., ECF No. [24-2], \u00b6 12.\n\nAccording to Graves, the first contributing incident occurred within days of his hiring, on or\n\nabout September 19, 1985, and the final contributing incident occurred shortly before the\n\ntermination of his employment, on or about September 18, 2005. The eighty-one incidents he\n\nhas identified are of a wide variety and cut a broad swath: some involve physical violence; others\n\ninvolve facially discriminatory comments by subordinates, co-workers, and supervisors; and still\n\nothers involve allegedly punitive assignments or unjustified disciplinary actions. Together, they\n\nimplicate literally dozens of actors working at various locations.\n\n       Graves commenced this action on January 22, 2007. See Compl., ECF No. [1].\n\nFollowing the conclusion of discovery, the District filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, which\n\nfocused in large part on the timeliness of Graves\u2019 suit. See Def. District of Columbia\u2019s Mot. for\n\nSumm. J., ECF No. [20]. The Court denied the District\u2019s motion on April 14, 2011. See Graves\n\nv. District of Columbia, 777 F. Supp. 2d 109 (D.D.C. 2011). In so doing, the Court highlighted\n\nseveral deficiencies in the District\u2019s approach. Most importantly, \u201cnearly all of the arguments\n\n\n                                                 2\n\ftendered by the District in support of its motion [were] premised, at least to some degree, on the\n\nerroneous assumption that Graves intend[ed] to pursue individual claims of discrimination for\n\neach of the employment-related incidents identified in his Complaint.\u201d Id. at 111. However,\n\nGraves \u201cmade it clear that he only intends to pursue two factually coextensive hostile work\n\nenvironment claims in this action, one arising under Title VII and a second arising under Section\n\n1981, and he expressly disavow[ed] an intention to pursue individual claims of discrimination for\n\neach separate incident contributing to the allegedly hostile work environment.\u201d Id. \u201cAs a result,\n\nthe vast majority of the District\u2019s motion [spoke] to claims that simply are not at issue in this\n\naction.\u201d Id. Similarly problematic, of the \u201ceighty-one incidents that collectively comprise the\n\nhostile work environment allegedly suffered by Graves during his employment, only a handful\n\nreceive[d] even passing mention in the District\u2019s moving papers,\u201d which left \u201caltogether\n\nunaddressed over seventy [] incidents that Graves identified as part of his hostile work\n\nenvironment claim during the course of discovery.\u201d Id. \u201c[H]aving failed to account for all or\n\neven a majority of these incidents, the District\u2019s motion [did] not speak to the totality of the\n\nhostile work environment allegedly suffered by Graves.\u201d Id. In short, the District\u2019s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment was woefully inadequate to challenge the sufficiency of Graves\u2019 hostile\n\nwork environment claims.\n\n       Upon the resolution of the District\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court and the\n\nparties proceeded to the pretrial stage of litigation. In order to \u201cnarrow the evidentiary issues at\n\ntrial,\u201d the Court authorized the parties to file motions in limine. Pretrial Scheduling and\n\nProcedures Order (Aug. 18, 2011), ECF No. [37], at 6. The District filed the instant Motion in\n\nLimine on October 7, 2011. Graves filed his opposition on November 3, 2011. The District filed\n\n\n                                                  3\n\fits reply on November 21, 2011.\n\n                                    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       Although neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor the Federal Rules of Evidence\n\nexpressly contemplate motions in limine, the practice of allowing such motions has developed\n\nover time \u201cpursuant to the district court\u2019s inherent authority to manage the course of trials.\u201d Luce\n\nv. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 41 n.4 (1984). Consistent with the historical origins of the\n\npractice, motions in limine are \u201cdesigned to narrow the evidentiary issues for trial and to\n\neliminate unnecessary trial interruptions.\u201d Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Educ., 913 F.2d 1064,\n\n1070 (3d Cir. 1990). Broadly speaking, the Federal Rules of Evidence permit the admission of\n\n\u201crelevant evidence\u201d\u2014that is, evidence that \u201chas any tendency to make a fact [of consequence]\n\nmore or less probable than it would be without the evidence,\u201d FED . R. EVID . 4012\u2014provided it is\n\nnot otherwise excluded by the Rules, the Constitution of the United States, or an Act of\n\nCongress, FED . R. EVID . 402, and its probative value is not \u201csubstantially outweighed by a danger\n\nof . . . unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or\n\nneedlessly presenting cumulative evidence,\u201d FED . R. EVID . 403.\n\n       In light of their limited purpose, motions in limine \u201cshould not be used to resolve factual\n\ndisputes,\u201d which remains the \u201cfunction of a motion for summary judgment, with its\n\naccompanying and crucial procedural safeguards.\u201d C & E Servs., Inc. v. Ashland Inc., 539 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 316, 323 (D.D.C. 2008); see also Dunn ex rel. Albery v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n\n264 F.R.D. 266, 274 (E.D. Mich. 2009) (\u201c[M]otions in limine are meant to deal with discrete\n\n\n       2\n         In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court shall reference the amended Federal\nRules of Evidence that, absent contrary Congressional action, will become effective on\nDecember 1, 2011 and will apply at the trial in this action.\n\n                                                  4\n\fevidentiary issues related to trial, and are not another excuse to file dispositive motions disguised\n\nas motions in limine.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In other words, \u201c[f]actual\n\nquestions should not be resolved through motions in limine,\u201d Goldman v. Healthcare Mgmt. Sys.,\n\nInc., 559 F. Supp. 2d 853, 871 (W.D. Mich. 2008) (citation omitted), nor is a motion in limine a\n\n\u201cvehicle for a party to ask the Court to weigh the sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d Bowers v. Nat\u2019l\n\nCollegiate Athletic Ass\u2019n, 563 F. Supp. 2d 508, 532 (D.N.J. 2008). Rather, parties should target\n\ntheir arguments to demonstrating why certain items or categories of evidence should (or should\n\nnot) be introduced at trial, and direct the trial judge to specific evidence in the record that would\n\nfavor or disfavor the introduction of those particular items or categories of evidence. U.S. ex rel.\n\nEl-Amin v. George Washington Univ., 533 F. Supp. 2d 12, 19 (D.D.C. 2008). In short, motions\n\nin limine are a means for arguing why \u201cevidence should or should not, for evidentiary reasons, be\n\nintroduced at trial.\u201d Williams v. Johnson, 747 F. Supp. 2d 10, 18 (D.D.C. 2010) (emphasis in\n\noriginal).\n\n        In deference to their familiarity with the details of the case and greater experience in\n\nevidentiary matters, trial judges are afforded broad discretion in rendering evidentiary rulings, a\n\ndiscretion which extends to assessing the probative value of the proffered evidence and weighing\n\nany factors against admissibility. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co. v. Mendelsohn, 552 U.S. 379, 384\n\n(2008). The trial judge\u2019s discretion extends not only to the substantive evidentiary ruling, but\n\nalso to the threshold question of whether a motion in limine presents an evidentiary issue that is\n\nappropriate for ruling in advance of trial. United States v. Valencia, 826 F.2d 169, 172 (2d Cir.\n\n1987); accord Rosemann v. Roto-Die, Inc., 377 F.3d 897, 902 (8th Cir. 2004); United States v.\n\nLayton, 720 F.2d 548, 553 (9th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1069 (1984), and overruled on\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fother grounds by United States v. W.R. Grace, 526 F.3d 499 (9th Cir. 2008). The trial judge has\n\nthe \u201cdiscretion to rule in limine or to await developments at trial before ruling.\u201d Stephen A.\n\nSaltzburg et al., FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE MANUAL \u00a7 103.02[13] (9th ed. 2006). \u201c[I]n some\n\ninstances it is best to defer rulings until trial, [when] decisions can be better informed by the\n\ncontext, foundation, and relevance of the contested evidence within the framework of the trial as\n\na whole.\u201d Casares v. Bernal, 790 F. Supp. 2d 769, 775 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (citation omitted).\n\n                                        III. DISCUSSION\n\n       Through its [38] Motion in Limine, the District asks the Court to preclude Graves from\n\nintroducing evidence at trial concerning a total of forty-four of the eighty-one component acts\n\nthat he originally identified as supporting his hostile work environment claims in the course of\n\ndiscovery. Of these forty-four acts, Graves represents that he will not seek to introduce evidence\n\nconcerning a total of twenty-eight. See infra Part III.A. As for the sixteen acts that still remain at\n\nissue, the Court shall require Graves to make an offer of proof demonstrating that there is a\n\nfactual basis for the trier of fact to infer that the incidents were motivated by a discriminatory\n\nanimus and are part of the same hostile work environment. See infra Part III.B.\n\n       A.      Graves Has Conceded the District\u2019s Motion as to Twenty-Eight Component Acts\n\n       The District\u2019s Motion in Limine asks the Court to preclude Graves from introducing\n\nevidence at trial concerning a total of forty-four component acts that he originally identified as\n\nsupporting his hostile work environment claims in the course of discovery. See Def.\u2019s Mem. at\n\n5-9. In opposition, Graves represents that he will not introduce evidence as to twenty-eight of the\n\nacts challenged by the District. See Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 2-3. Based on this explicit concession, the\n\nCourt shall GRANT the District\u2019s [38] Motion in Limine as conceded with respect to the\n\n\n                                                  6\n\ffollowing twenty-eight acts:3\n\n               (1)    Incident No. 9 \u2014 March 1, 1987;\n\n               (2)    Incident No. 15 \u2014 Approx. 1988;\n\n               (3)    Incident No. 17 \u2014 Nov. 1989-2005;\n\n               (4)    Incident No. 23 \u2014 May 5, 1991;\n\n               (5)    Incident No. 24 \u2014 July 4, 1992;\n\n               (6)    Incident No. 25 \u2014 July 7, 1993;\n\n               (7)    Incident No. 27 \u2014 Mar. 2, 1994;\n\n               (8)    Incident No. 29 \u2014 May 19, 1994;\n\n               (9)    Incident No. 30 \u2014 Feb. 12, 1995;\n\n               (10)   Incident No. 31 \u2014 Approx. 1995;\n\n               (11)   Incident No. 32 \u2014 Apr. 2, 1995;\n\n               (12)   Incident No. 33 \u2014 Dec. 31, 1995;\n\n               (13)   Incident No. 36 \u2014 July 12, 1997;\n\n               (14)   Incident No. 38 \u2014 Jan. 7, 1998;\n\n               (15)   Incident No. 40 \u2014 Feb. 7, 1998;\n\n               (16)   Incident No. 41 \u2014 May 24, 1998;\n\n               (17)   Incident No. 42 \u2014 Nov. 7, 1998;\n\n               (18)   Incident No. 44 \u2014 June 1, 1999;\n\n\n\n       3\n         In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Court shall identify component acts by the\nnumber and approximate date assigned to them by Graves in his opposition to the District\u2019s\nMotion for Summary Judgment. See Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n to Def. District of Columbia\u2019s Mot. for Summ.\nJ., ECF No. [24], at 2-24.\n\n                                              7\n\f               (19)    Incident No. 45 \u2014 Sept. 10, 1999;\n\n               (20)    Incident No. 51 \u2014 Aug. 2000;\n\n               (21)    Incident No. 53 \u2014 Apr. 28, 2001;\n\n               (22)    Incident No. 59 \u2014 June 16, 2002;\n\n               (23)    Incident No. 60 \u2014 Dec. 2, 2002;\n\n               (24)    Incident No. 62 \u2014 Apr. 16, 2003;\n\n               (25)    Incident No. 64 \u2014 Sept. 10, 2003;\n\n               (26)    Incident No. 75 \u2014 Feb. 5, 2005;\n\n               (27)    Incident No. 80 \u2014 July 4, 2005; and\n\n               (28)    Incident No. 81 \u2014 Aug. 1, 2005.\n\n       In light of his explicit concession, Graves shall be PRECLUDED from introducing\n\nevidence as to the foregoing twenty-eight component acts at trial.\n\n       B.      Graves Shall Be Required to Make an Offer of Proof as to the Sixteen Component\n               Acts that Remain at Issue\n\n       As for the sixteen component acts that remain at issue, the District argues, in essence, that\n\nno reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the acts are indicative of race-based discrimination\n\nand/or part of the same actionable hostile working environment. See Def.\u2019s Mem. at 5. To\n\nprevail on a claim for hostile work environment, a plaintiff must establish that his \u201cworkplace is\n\npermeated with \u2018discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult\u2019 that is \u2018sufficiently severe or\n\npervasive to alter the conditions of [his] employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment.\u2019\u201d Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (quoting Meritor Sav. Bank,\n\nFSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65 & 67 (1986)). In determining whether a hostile work\n\nenvironment exists, the trier of fact must take into account \u201cthe totality of the circumstances,\n\n                                                  8\n\fincluding the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether\n\nit interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d Baloch v. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191,\n\n1201 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The District\u2019s Motion in Limine turns on two principles relating to this\n\noverarching concept, both of which circumscribe the reach of hostile work environment claims.\n\n       First, evidence that bears no connection to the plaintiff\u2019s protected status cannot support a\n\nhostile work environment claim. Harris v. Wackenhut Servs., Inc., 419 F. App\u2019x 1, 2 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2011) (per curiam) (citing, inter alia, Richardson v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Corr. Serv., 180 F.3d\n\n426, 440 (2d Cir. 1999)). Therefore, courts should exclude from consideration employment-\n\nrelated actions that \u201clack a linkage\u201d to discrimination. Bryant v. Brownlee, 265 F. Supp. 2d 52,\n\n63 (D.D.C. 2003) (quoting Alfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 377 (2d Cir. 2002)); accord Baloch\n\nv. Norton, 517 F. Supp. 2d 345, 363 (D.D.C. 2007), aff\u2019d sub nom. Baloch v. Kempthorne, 550\n\nF.3d 1191 (D.C. Cir. 2008). But incidents need not always bear \u201covert discriminatory overtones\u201d\n\nto have a linkage to discrimination. Hutchinson v. Holder, __ F. Supp. 2d __, 2011 WL\n\n4537878, at *17 (D.D.C. Oct. 3, 2011) (citing McKinney v. Dole, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1985), abrogated on other grounds by Stevens v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, 500 U.S. 1 (1991)). Rather,\n\n\u201cfacially neutral incidents may . . . be considered as part of the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019\n\nsupporting a plaintiff\u2019s hostile work environment claim\u201d if a \u201ctrier of fact could reasonably\n\nconclude that they were, in fact, based on the plaintiff\u2019s [protected status].\u201d Mason v. Geithner,\n\n__ F. Supp. 2d __, 2011 WL 4014300, at *29 (D.D.C. Sept. 12, 2011) (citing Alfano, 294 F.3d at\n\n378). In other words, the plaintiff must proffer a factual basis for inferring that the incidents\n\nwere motivated by a discriminatory animus. Id.\n\n       Second, so long as at least one act \u201ccontributing to the claim occurs within the filing\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fperiod, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered . . . for the purposes\n\nof determining liability.\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 105 (2002); see\n\nalso Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc., 550 U.S. 618, 638 n.7 (2007) (\u201c[A]t least\n\nsome of the discriminatorily motivated acts predicate to a hostile work environment claim [must]\n\n. . . occur within the charging period.\u201d), superseded by statute in part, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay\n\nAct of 2009, Pub. L. No. 11-2, 123 Stat. 5 (2009). However, \u201cthe acts about which [the plaintiff]\n\ncomplains [must be] part of the same actionable hostile work environment practice.\u201d Morgan,\n\n536 U.S. at 120. The trier of fact \u201cneed not consider an alleged incident if it \u2018had no relation to\n\nthe [other] acts, or for some other reason . . . was not part of the same hostile work environment\n\nclaim.\u2019\u201d Vickers v. Powell, 493 F.3d 186, 199 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Morgan, 536 U.S. at\n\n118) (notations in original).\n\n        Citing these two principles, the District urges the Court to preclude Graves from\n\nintroducing evidence as to the sixteen component acts that remain at issue on the basis that no\n\nreasonable trier of fact could conclude that the acts are indicative of race-based discrimination\n\nand/or part of the same actionable hostile working environment. Presented with these arguments,\n\nthe Court is mindful that motions in limine are designed to address discrete evidentiary issues\n\nrelated to trial and are not a vehicle for resolving factual disputes or testing the sufficiency of the\n\nplaintiff\u2019s evidence. See supra Part II. In this regard, the Court is concerned that the District\u2019s\n\nmotion falls on the wrong side of the line between a proper motion in limine and a disguised\n\nmotion for summary judgment. However, before reaching this issue, there is a threshold matter\n\nthat should first be addressed. In this case, the factual record \u201chas been so poorly developed by\n\nthe parties that the Court frankly knows very little about the factual circumstances surrounding\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fthe component acts comprising Graves\u2019 hostile work environment claim[s].\u201d Graves, 777 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 122. That observation, first made in the context of resolving the District\u2019s Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment, holds no less true today. Simply put, the factual record is so skeletal and\n\nincomplete that it is nearly impossible for the Court to determine whether the District\u2019s\n\narguments are amenable to resolution on a motion in limine.\n\n        When the probative value of evidence is called into doubt at the motions in limine stage,\n\nthe trial judge may exercise her discretion to require the proponent to make an offer of proof in\n\nadvance of trial. See Brooks v. Chrysler Corp., 786 F.2d 1191, 1197 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert.\n\ndenied, 479 U.S. 853 (1986); see generally 21 Charles Alan Wright et al., FEDERAL PRACTICE\n\nAND   PROCEDURE \u00a7 5040.2 (2d ed. 1987). That is especially true where, as here, \u201cneither party\n\nhas directed the court to a specific exhibit or item of evidence whose [sic] admissibility is at\n\nissue.\u201d Kuiper v. Givaudan, Inc., 602 F. Supp. 2d 1036, 1047 (N.D. Iowa 2009). The offer of\n\nproof is designed to inform the trial judge \u201cwhat the proponent expect[s] to prove by the\n\nevidence, thereby enabl[ing] the [trial judge] to determine whether the evidence would be\n\nadmissible for any purpose.\u201d Stephen A. Saltzburg et al., FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE\n\nMANUAL \u00a7 103.02[7] (9th ed. 2006). In this case, given the sparse factual record created by the\n\nparties, the Court considers it prudent to exercise its discretion to require Graves to make an offer\n\nof proof as to the sixteen component acts that remain at issue. Indeed, based on its past\n\nexperience with pretrial matters, the Court is mindful that knowing the factual predicate for a\n\nparty\u2019s claims is essential to evaluating any objections to anticipated witnesses and exhibits. In\n\nother words, even separate and apart from the District\u2019s Motion in Limine, the Court is confident\n\nthat requiring Graves to make an offer of proof will assist both the Court and the parties in\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fevaluating the Joint Pretrial Statement and associated objections, which are due to be filed with\n\nthe Court on January 10, 2012.\n\n        Accordingly, for each of the following sixteen acts, Graves must make an offer of proof\n\ndemonstrating that there is a factual basis for the trier of fact to infer that the incident was (1)\n\nmotivated by a discriminatory animus and (2) part of the same hostile work environment:\n\n                (1)     Incident No. 11 \u2014 Approx. 1987;\n\n                (2)     Incident No. 18 \u2014 Dec. 20, 1989;\n\n                (3)     Incident No. 19 \u2014 May 8, 1990;\n\n                (4)     Incident No. 20 \u2014 May 10, 1990;\n\n                (5)     Incident No. 21 \u2014 May 11, 1990;\n\n                (6)     Incident No. 22 \u2014 July 15, 1990;\n\n                (7)     Incident No. 34 \u2014 July 19, 1997;\n\n                (8)     Incident No. 35 \u2014 Jan. 17, 1998;\n\n                (9)     Incident No. 37 \u2014 Oct. 13, 1997;\n\n                (10)    Incident No. 48 \u2014 Dec. 19, 1999;\n\n                (11)    Incident No. 49 \u2014 Dec. 1999;\n\n                (12)    Incident No. 61 \u2014 Mar. 10. 2003;\n\n                (13)    Incident No. 65 \u2014 Approx. 2004;4\n\n\n        4\n           The Court notes that the District argues that this incident (Incident No. 65 \u2014 Approx.\n2004) cannot be considered as part of an actionable hostile work environment because it does not\ninvolve something that Graves personally experienced. See Def.\u2019s Mem. at 10; Def.\u2019s Reply at 3.\nFrom his opposition, it is unclear whether Graves even intends to claim that the trier of fact\nshould consider the incident as part of his hostile work environment or whether he instead merely\nsees it as evidence of the District\u2019s knowledge. See Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 10.
