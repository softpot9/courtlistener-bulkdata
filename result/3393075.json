time to time complaints have been filed against members of the bar in the Fourth Judicial Circuit for alleged breaches of ethical conduct as laid down by the statutes of Florida and by the canons of the American Bar Association, which canons were duly adopted by the State Board of Law Examiners in October, 1934. That similar complaints are made against members of the bar in jurisdictions other than the Fourth Judicial Circuit and that effective disciplinary action cannot be taken with regard to said complaints without a special rule permitting the Circuit Courts to appoint Commissions to make investigations and report their findings of fact to the Circuit Court for appropriate action.</p>\n<p>An attorney at law holds his office during good behavior and his right to practice law is one of which he cannot be deprived by the court except for legal cause, and then only in a manner pointed out by law.
