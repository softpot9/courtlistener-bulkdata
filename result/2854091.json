concerning six children.\n\nAppellant Bobbie H.\u2014the biological mother of the children\u2014challenges the legal\n\nand factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s section 161.001(1)\n\nand best-interest findings.        Appellants Minnie B. and Rudolph B., pro\n\nse\u2014Bobbie\u2019s mother and her husband\u2014challenge the legal and factual\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings that Minnie and\n\n\n      1\n          \u2026 See T EX. R. A PP. P. 47.4.\n\fRudolph should not be named managing conservators of two of the children or\n\npossessory conservators of any of the six children. We affirm.\n\nI.    Background\n\n      The following summary of the evidence will put the issues into context.\n\nWe will discuss the evidence in greater detail later in this opinion as it pertains\n\nto the individual issues.\n\n      Bobbie is twenty-eight years old and the mother of six children: twins\n\nB.M. and S.M., age eight; R.M., age five; J.M., age four; J.R., age three; and\n\nL.R., age two.2 School teachers, daycare workers, and medical professionals\n\nmade at least ten reports concerning the children\u2019s welfare to the Department\n\nof Family and Prospective Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d) between 2003 and the\n\ntime of trial.   Those reports, and the Department\u2019s investigation of and\n\nresponse to same, included the following incidents.\n\n      In October 2004, the Department investigated a report that S.M. had a\n\nblack eye. When the Department and the Denton County Sheriff\u2019s Office went\n\nto the family\u2019s trailer home to investigate, they found the home in an unlivable\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        \u2026 Sherman M. is the father of the four older children, and Stephen R. is\nthe father of the two younger children. Stephen did not appear or otherwise\nrespond to the Department\u2019s petition to terminate his parental rights, and the\ntrial court terminated his rights. The Department did not seek to terminate\nSherman\u2019s parental rights.\n\n                                        2\n\fcondition. Michael Hendrix, a sheriff\u2019s office investigator, testified that the\n\nfloor had holes in it, there was no running water, electricity was supplied by an\n\nextension cord running from Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s trailer next door, the stove\n\nand heating unit were inoperable, and the family shared the trailer with two\n\ncats and four dogs. Bobbie did, however, have a hotplate and an electric oven\n\nto prepare meals. The children had head lice, which Bobbie was attempting to\n\ntreat with mayonnaise and vinegar or alcohol, but she was not treating the\n\nchildren\u2019s bedding or clothing. The Department did not remove the children;\n\ninstead, it implemented a temporary safety plan under which the children were\n\nto stay with Rudolph and Minnie while Bobbie repaired the trailer; the\n\nDepartment paid for the repairs. Bobbie and the children moved back into the\n\ntrailer when the repairs were complete.\n\n      In August 2005, Bobbie took L.R.\u2014who was two months old and had not\n\nseen a doctor since birth\u2014to the health department. L.R. had an infection\n\nunder his neck where baby formula had been allowed to build up. Also, his\n\nfingernails were too long, allowing him to scratch himself; the back of his head\n\nwas flattened from lying on his back excessively; and he had a bad diaper rash.\n\nThe health department reported L.R.\u2019s condition to the Department, and the\n\nDepartment placed L.R. and J.R. with Rudolph and Minnie for thirty days.\n\nDepartment caseworker Dayana Alcazar inspected Bobbie\u2019s trailer on August\n\n                                       3\n\f12 and found it to be very dirty. Alcazar visited the home again on September\n\n2 and found the trailer to be very clean; but when she visited a third time on\n\nSeptember 16, the condition was not as good, and she found cat feces on the\n\nfloor where L.R. was playing.\n\n      In November 2005, Bonnie\u2019s electricity was cut off due to nonpayment,\n\nand she and the children moved into Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s trailer, where they\n\nslept on a porch that had been converted into a bedroom.            The small,\n\nwindowless room was heated by a space heater on a shelf, and Bobbie would\n\nsmoke in the room with the six children present. Bobbie and the children slept\n\non a porch glider, two cribs, and a mattress on the floor. Minnie testified that\n\nshe slept in the room with the children when Bobbie was working the night shift\n\nat the waffle house where she was employed.\n\n      On December 25, 2005, Bobbie took L.R. to the hospital because he was\n\nhaving difficulty breathing. L.R. was hospitalized with pneumonia, and the\n\nhospital reported to the Department that Bobbie had been feeding L.R.\n\nevaporated milk instead of formula.     Department caseworker Michelle Hiza\n\ninvestigated the referral.   W hen Hiza went to the hospital, Bobbie was not\n\nthere; but Hiza was able to interview Minnie\u2014 who also happened to be\n\nhospitalized at the time\u2014and Rudolph, who was sitting with L.R. Rudolph told\n\nher that he thought Bobbie was a very good mom and that he had no concern\n\n                                       4\n\fabout Bobbie\u2019s feeding L.R. a mixture of evaporated milk and water. Likewise,\n\nMinnie told Hiza that she thought Bobbie was a good mom and that she had no\n\nconcerns about the children\u2019s care.        Hiza interviewed Bobbie the next day.\n\nBobbie told her that she was feeding evaporated milk and water to L.R. because\n\nhe could not keep whole milk or formula down. Hiza testified that Bobbie was\n\n\u201cangry, screaming, [and] yelling\u201d during the interview and used a lot of\n\nprofanity. When Bobbie stayed in the hospital with L.R., the nurses had to\n\nwake her up when L.R. was crying and ask her to take care of him; on one\n\noccasion, Bobbie rolled over and went back to sleep. When she fed L.R. in the\n\nhospital, she sometimes propped L.R. up with a bottle so that he could feed\n\nhimself.\n\n      Further   investigation   by   the   Department   revealed   the   following\n\ninformation:\n\n      \u2022     Dennis K., Bobbie\u2019s boyfriend, moved in with Bobbie and the\n            children in December 2005. Dennis had recently been\n            released from prison and had a history of assault and family\n            violence. The record is not clear about how long Dennis lived\n            with Bobbie.\n\n      \u2022     When B.M. and S.M. began kindergarten, B.M.\u2019s speech was\n            unintelligible and she communicated with grunts; S.M.\u2019s\n            verbal skills were better but still below average for her age.\n\n      \u2022     B.M. and S.M. often went to school dirty and wearing ill-\n            fitting or inappropriate clothes and shoes.\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      \u2022     When Hiza visited R.M., B.M., and S.M. at school, she found\n            their speech unintelligible; she testified that they \u201creally had\n            their own kind of language.\u201d\n\n      \u2022     Hiza also testified that R.M.\u2019s stomach was distended and\n            looked \u201cvery unusual.\u201d Hiza later saw J.M. and J.R. and\n            observed that their stomachs also \u201ckind of protruded out.\u201d\n\n      The Department removed all six children on January 3, 2006. The trial\n\ncourt signed an order implementing a service plan for Bobbie on January 27,\n\n2006. Bobbie completed a psychological evaluation with Dr. Mark Foster, who\n\ntestified that she functioned emotionally on the level of a mid- to early\n\nadolescent. Dr. Foster recommended that she take anger management classes,\n\nbut Bobbie did not attend the classes. The trial court ordered Bobbie to attend\n\nweekly counseling sessions with therapist Michelle Greer; Bobbie met with\n\nGreer six times then missed several appointments, cursed at Greer over the\n\nphone, and refused to attend any more sessions. Bobbie testified that she\n\nstopped attending the sessions because she could not pay the fee Greer\n\ncharged her for missed sessions (the Department paid for the sessions Bobbie\n\nactually attended), but Greer testified that she charged the missed-session fee\n\nin an attempt to make Bobbie feel as though the therapy had value and that\n\nBobbie refused to attend any more sessions even after Greer offered to reduce\n\nthe missed-session fee and let Bobbie pay it out over time. Bobbie completed\n\nher MHMR assessment and participated in in-home parenting classes as\n\n                                        6\n\fordered; but CASA advocate Vicky Ulrich testified that the classes had no\n\neffect on her parenting ability. Bobbie maintained housing and employment, but\n\nshe stopped making child support payments a year before trial.\n\n      Bobbie visited the children regularly while all six were in foster care in the\n\nDenton area.    Department workers\u2019 written descriptions of the visitations\n\nspotlight the Department\u2019s concerns with Bobbie\u2019s parental abilities:\n\n      \u2022     Bobbie found a cup half-full of an unidentified liquid in the\n            conference room where the visitation occurred; she emptied\n            the cup and\u2014without washing it\u2014filled it with apple juice; all\n            of the children shared the cup for the duration of the visit;\n\n      \u2022     She lifted L.R. off the floor by one wrist to stop him from\n            pushing J.R.\u2019s chair;\n\n      \u2022     When J.R. attempted to walk out of the visitation room, she\n            grabbed him by the wrist and pushed him to the floor;\n\n      \u2022     She frequently \u201cyelled and screamed\u201d at Department workers\n            during the visits;\n\n      \u2022     She \u201cmade a big deal about the children eat[ing] all the sugar\n            so they could be \u2018hyper\u2019 when they go back\u201d to their foster\n            homes;\n\n      \u2022     She did not attempt to redirect the children when they\n            engaged in inappropriate behavior, such as climbing on\n            cabinets, playing with electrical outlets, and taking toys from\n            one another;\n\n      \u2022     She allowed the children to listen to sexually suggestive song\n            lyrics on her cell phone;\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f      \u2022     She lifted L.R. by his upper arm and argued with a\n            Department worker who told her that lifting L.R. that way\n            might dislocate his shoulder; a few minutes later, she jerked\n            J.R. by his upper arm;\n\n      \u2022     She mocked J.R. by screaming at him when J.R. cried or lost\n            his temper; and\n\n      \u2022     She sometimes arrived late and twice left one hour into the\n            two-hour visitation.\n\n      After the four older children were placed with relatives in Wichita Falls,\n\nBobbie visited them only three times in a ten-month period. Bobbie testified\n\nthat she could not visit the children in Wichita Falls because her truck broke\n\ndown, but she also testified that her mother would provide transportation for\n\nthe visits. The children\u2019s foster father testified that on one visit in Wichita\n\nFalls, Bobbie spent thirty or forty minutes with the children, then left to meet\n\nwith friends. The two younger children remained in foster care in Denton, and\n\nalthough Bobbie was scheduled to visit them twice a month, she visited them\n\nonly six times in the ten months following July 2006.\n\n      At trial, Bobbie testified, \u201cI don\u2019t want my children back with me. I can\u2019t\n\ntake care of them\u201d and \u201cI just want visitation.\u201d The jury found that Bobbie had\n\nviolated subsections (D), (E), (N), and (O)3 of family code section 161.001(1);\n\n\n      3\n       \u2026 The jury\u2019s findings on subsections (D), (E), and (N) were unanimous.\nThe jury split eleven to one on the subsection (O) findings with regard to each\nchild.\n\n                                       8\n\fthat termination of Bobbie\u2019s parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interest;\n\nthat the Department should be named as permanent managing conservator of\n\nJ.R. and L.R.; and that Rudolph and Minnie\u2014who intervened in the termination\n\nproceeding\u2014should not be named possessory conservators of any of the\n\nchildren. The trial court terminated Bobbie\u2019s parental rights and appointed the\n\nDepartment as the children\u2019s permanent managing conservator. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.

F AM. C ODE A NN. \u00a7 101.007\n\n(Vernon 2002).\n\n      When reviewing the evidence for legal sufficiency in parental termination\n\ncases, we must determine whether the evidence is such that a fact-finder could\n\nreasonably form a firm belief or conviction that the grounds for termination\n\nwere proven.     In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570, 573 (Tex. 2005).        We must\n\nreview all the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding and judgment.\n\nId. This means that we must assume that the fact-finder resolved any disputed\n\nfacts in favor of its finding if a reasonable fact-finder could have done so. Id.\n\nWe must also disregard all evidence that a reasonable fact-finder could have\n\ndisbelieved. Id. We must consider, however, undisputed evidence even if it is\n\ncontrary to the finding. Id. That is, we must consider evidence favorable to\n\ntermination if a reasonable fact-finder could, and disregard contrary evidence\n\nunless a reasonable fact-finder could not. Id.\n\n      We must therefore consider all of the evidence, not just that which favors\n\nthe verdict. Id. But we cannot weigh witness credibility issues that depend on\n\nthe appearance and demeanor of the witnesses, for that is the fact-finder\u2019s\n\nprovince. Id. at 573, 574. And even when credibility issues appear in the\n\nappellate record, we must defer to the fact-finder\u2019s determinations as long as\n\nthey are not unreasonable. Id. at 573.\n\n                                       11\n\f      When reviewing the evidence for factual sufficiency, we must give due\n\ndeference to the fact-finder\u2019s findings and not supplant the verdict with our\n\nown. In re H.R.M., 209 S.W.3d 105, 108 (Tex. 2006). We must determine\n\nwhether, on the entire record, a fact-finder could reasonably form a firm\n\nconviction or belief that the parent violated the relevant conduct provision of\n\nsection 161.001(1) and that the termination of the parent\u2019s parental rights\n\nwould be in the best interest of the child. In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 28 (Tex.\n\n2002). If, in light of the entire record, the disputed evidence that a reasonable\n\nfact-finder could not have credited in favor of the finding is so significant that\n\na fact-finder could not reasonably have formed a firm belief or conviction in the\n\ntruth of its finding, then the evidence is factually insufficient. H.R.M., 209\n\nS.W.3d at 108.\n\n      B.    Analysis\n\n            1.    Grounds for termination: Endangerment\n\n      In her first and second issues, Bobbie challenges the legal and factual\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings under family code\n\nsection 161.001(1)(D) and (E).      Subsection (D) authorizes termination if a\n\nparent knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the child to remain in conditions\n\nor surroundings that endanger the child\u2019s physical or emotional well-being, and\n\nsubsection (E) authorizes termination if a parent engaged in conduct that\n\n                                       12\n\fendangers the child\u2019s physical or emotional well-being. T EX. F AM. C ODE A NN.\n\n\u00a7 161.001(1)(D), (E).\n\n      Endangerment means to expose to loss or injury, to jeopardize. Boyd,\n\n727 S.W.2d at 533; see also In re M.C., 917 S.W.2d 268, 269 (Tex. 1996).\n\nUnder subsection (D), it is necessary to examine evidence related to the\n\nenvironment of the child to determine if the environment was the source of\n\nendangerment to the child\u2019s physical or emotional well-being. In re D.T., 34\n\nS.W.3d 625, 633 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2000, pet. denied). Conduct of a\n\nparent in the home can create an environment that endangers the physical and\n\nemotional well-being of a child.    In re W.S., 899 S.W.2d 772, 776 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Fort Worth 1995, no writ). For example, abusive or violent conduct by\n\na parent or other resident of a child\u2019s home may produce an environment that\n\nendangers the physical or emotional well-being of a child. See id. at 776\u201377;\n\nZiegler v. Tarrant County Child Welfare Unit, 680 S.W.2d 674, 678 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Fort Worth 1984, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.).\n\n      Under subsection (E), the relevant inquiry is whether evidence exists that\n\nthe endangerment of the child\u2019s physical well-being was the direct result of the\n\nparent\u2019s conduct, including acts, omissions, or failures to act. In re R.D., 955\n\nS.W.2d 364, 368 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 1997, pet. denied); Dupree v. Tex.\n\nDep\u2019t of Protective & Regulatory Servs., 907 S.W.2d 81, 83-84 (Tex.\n\n                                      13\n\fApp.\u2014Dallas 1995, no writ).         Additionally, termination under section\n\n161.001(1)(E) must be based on more than a single act or omission; a\n\nvoluntary, deliberate, and conscious course of conduct by the parent is\n\nrequired. T EX. F AM. C ODE A NN. \u00a7 161.001(1)(E); D.T., 34 S.W.3d at 634; In re\n\nK.M.M., 993 S.W.2d 225, 228 (Tex. App.\u2014Eastland 1999, no pet.). Under\n\neither subsection (D) or (E), it is not necessary that the parent\u2019s conduct be\n\ndirected at the child or that the child actually suffer injury. Boyd, 727 S.W.2d\n\nat 533.\n\n      Because the evidence concerning these two statutory grounds for\n\ntermination is interrelated, we consolidate our examination of it. See In re\n\nJ.T.G, 121 S.W.3d 117, 126 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2003, no pet.); In re\n\nB.R., 822 S.W.2d 103, 106 (Tex. App.\u2014Tyler 1991, writ denied) (recognizing\n\nthe link between a parent\u2019s conduct and a child\u2019s conditions and surroundings).\n\n      The Department\u2019s brief recites a litany of facts and circumstances that\n\nsupport the jury\u2019s endangerment findings, as follows:\n\n      \u2022     The children were seen eating dog food off the floor of\n            Bobbie\u2019s home in February 2003;\n\n      \u2022     Her home had old dog food matted into the carpet in\n            September 2003;\n\n      \u2022     There were two large holes in the home\u2019s floor, which a\n            sheriff\u2019s investigator testified were a hazard to the children\n            in October 2004;\n\n                                      14\n\f\u2022   In October 2004, the home had no running water, the stove\n    was disconnected, and electricity was supplied via a power\n    cord connected to Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s residence next door,\n    and the Department declared the home unlivable;\n\n\u2022   According to Bobbie, the children bathed at Minnie\u2019s house,\n    but during the Department\u2019s investigation, Minnie was out of\n    town, the house was locked, and Bobbie and the children had\n    no access to water;\n\n\u2022   In December 2005, Bobbie and the children were living on\n    the enclosed porch of her mother\u2019s trailer;\n\n\u2022   The children were not clean when attending daycare, and\n    daycare staff had to bathe them;\n\n\u2022   Bobbie took J.M. to daycare with dirty bottles;\n\n\u2022   J.R. fell off Bobbie\u2019s bed when he was two weeks old;\n\n\u2022   The children repeatedly had head lice;\n\n\u2022   When she began kindergarten, B.M. could not speak and\n    communicated by grunting; her twin, S.M., could speak, but\n    was behind for her age; they were often dirty and\n    inappropriately clothed; and B.M. had to repeat kindergarten;\n\n\u2022   L.R. had an infection on his neck from formula build-up, a flat\n    head from being left on his back excessively, and scratched\n    himself with overlong fingernails;\n\n\u2022   The sheets on the children\u2019s beds were dirty;\n\n\u2022   B.M. appeared to be dehydrated at school;\n\n\u2022   Bobbie was unable to afford formula for L.R. and failed to\n    maintain her WIC coverage;\n\n\n                              15\n\f      \u2022     Bobbie failed to maintain Medicaid coverage for the children;\n\n      \u2022     Bobbie exhibited an unwillingness or inability to care for L.R.\n            when he was hospitalized;\n\n      \u2022     In January 2006, Bobbie\u2019s home was dirty and had feces on\n            the floor; garbage and cigarettes were accessible to the\n            children; and the dishwasher had no front cover and was a\n            hazard to the children;\n\n      \u2022     When Department caseworker Hiza visited R.M., B.M., and\n            S.M. at school, they were filthy;\n\n      \u2022     Bobbie refused to let the Department have J.R.\u2019s hair cut,\n            even though the hair would stick to his face because of the\n            food and mucus in it; and\n\n      \u2022     In December 2005, Bobbie allowed Dennis K.\u2014who had just\n            been released from prison after serving a sentence for family\n            violence and assault with a deadly weapon\u2014move into her\n            home; Bobbie testified that Dennis did not move in with her\n            until after the Department removed the children from her\n            home, but he was living with her at the time of trial. Also at\n            the time of trial, Dennis was under indictment for a drug\n            charge and a family violence assault charge.\n\n      Bobbie also exhibited potentially endangering behavior during supervised\n\nvisitations with the children after the Department removed them from her home,\n\nincluding the following:\n\n      \u2022     During one visitation, Bobbie\u2014 who was talking on her cell\n            phone\u2014grabbed J.R. by the wrist and pushed him back into\n            the visitation room; J.R. hit his head on the television stand;\n\n      \u2022     On one occasion, Bobbie found a half-filled cup by the sink\n            in the visitation room; she poured its contents down the sink,\n\n\n                                      16\n\f            filled the cup with apple juice, and let all six children drink\n            out of it for the duration of the visit;\n\n      \u2022     All Bobbie provided for the children\u2019s lunch during one visit\n            was a loaf of white bread;\n\n      \u2022     On one occasion, Bobbie lifted L.R. by one wrist; on another\n            occasion, she lifted him over a chair by one arm;\n\n      \u2022     Bobbie allowed the children to play with potentially\n            dangerous objects during the visitations, such as electrical\n            outlets, and left the baby, L.R., on the floor where he could\n            get knocked over by the other children.\n\n      Bobbie argues that while at times her home was dirty and her children\n\nwere unkempt and had head lice, at other times her home and children were\n\nrelatively clean. But a more accurate assessment of the record shows\u2014as the\n\nState argues\u2014that conditions would improve while the Department was\n\nactively involved in Bobbie\u2019s life, then deteriorate when its involvement ended.\n\n      Viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we\n\nhold a fact-finder could reasonably form a firm belief or conviction that Bobbie\n\nendangered the children.    See In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d at 573. Thus, the\n\nevidence is legally sufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings that Bobbie violated\n\nfamily code sections 161.001(1)(D) and (E). We further hold that the evidence\n\nis factually sufficient to support the findings. See In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d at 28.\n\nWe overrule Bobbie\u2019s first and second issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f      Having determined that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to\n\nsupport the jury\u2019s findings under sections 161.001(1)(D) and (E), we do not\n\nreach her third and fourth issues, in which she argues that the evidence is\n\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings under sections\n\n161.001(1)(N) and (O). See T EX. R. A PP. P. 47.1; In re J.L., 163 S.W.3d at 84;\n\nIn re E.M.N., 221 S.W.3d 815, 821 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2007, no pet.).\n\n            2.     Best interest\n\n      In her fifth issue, Bobbie challenges the legal and factually sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings that termination is in the children\u2019s\n\nbest interest.     Prompt and permanent placement of the child in a safe\n\nenvironment is presumed to be in the child\u2019s best interest. T EX. F AM. C ODE A NN.\n\n\u00a7 263.307(a) (Vernon 2002). There is also a strong presumption that keeping\n\na child with a parent is in the child\u2019s best interest. In re R.R., 209 S.W.3d 112,\n\n116 (Tex. 2006). Nonexclusive factors that the trier of fact in a termination\n\ncase may use in determining the best interest of the child include:\n\n      (1)   the desires of the child;\n\n      (2)   the emotional and physical needs of the child now and\n            in the future;\n\n      (3)   the emotional and physical danger to the child now and\n            in the future;\n\n      (4)   the parental abilities of the individuals seeking custody;\n\n                                        18\n\f      (5)      the programs available to assist these individuals to\n               promote the best interest of the child;\n\n      (6)      the plans for the child by these individuals or by the\n               agency seeking custody;\n\n      (7)      the stability of the home or proposed placement;\n\n      (8)      the acts or omissions of the parent which may indicate\n               that the existing parent-child relationship is not a\n               proper one; and\n\n      (9)      any excuse for the acts or omissions of the parent.\n\nHolley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371\u201372 (Tex. 1976).\n\n      These factors are not exhaustive; some listed factors may be inapplicable\n\nto some cases; other factors not on the list may also be considered when\n\nappropriate. C.H., 89 S.W.3d at 27. Furthermore, undisputed evidence of just\n\none factor may be sufficient in a particular case to support a finding that\n\ntermination is in the best interest of the child. Id.    On the other hand, the\n\npresence of scant evidence relevant to each factor will not support such a\n\nfinding. Id.\n\n      Michelle Greer, a therapist with whom Bobbie attended six counseling\n\nsessions as a part of her service plan,4 testified that Bobbie was not concerned\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       \u2026 Greer testified that after six appointments, Bobbie got angry, cursed\nat Greer over the phone, and told Greer that she would not attend counseling\nany longer.\n\n                                        19\n\fwith the children\u2019s condition when the Department removed them from her\n\nhome and therefore did not feel that she needed to make any changes in the\n\nway she cared for them. Ulrich\u2014the CASA advocate\u2014testified that Bobbie did\n\nnot comply with techniques that were taught in the parenting class that Bobbie\n\ntook, and the class seemed to have no effect on her progress. Ulrich testified\n\nthat Bobbie never accepted responsibility for her children\u2019s removal and that her\n\nrefusal to do so was a \u201chuge problem\u201d because \u201cif you don\u2019t think that there\u2019s\n\na problem, you can\u2019t fix it.\u201d Department conservatorship worker Amie Fletcher\n\ntestified that Bobbie failed to exhibit adequate parenting skills during supervised\n\nvisitations   and   showed   no   improvement after her parenting           classes.\n\nConservatorship worker Shelby Johnson testified that Bobbie expressed an\n\noverall lack of interest in raising the children and providing for their basic needs.\n\n      After removing the children from Bobbie\u2019s home, the Department\n\neventually placed J.M., R.M., S.M., and B.M. with David and Georgia G., who\n\nare relatives of their biological father, Sherman M.5 When David and Georgia\n\nreceived the children, J.M. and R.M. did not know how to feed themselves and\n\nS.M. and B.M. had no concept of how to brush their teeth. Amie Fletcher\n\ntestified that the children\u2019s behavior improved while they lived with David and\n\n\n      5\n      \u2026 The children were in other foster homes between the time of removal\nand the time of placement with David and Georgia.\n\n                                         20\n\fGeorgia. David testified that the children are happy, laughing, and playing. The\n\nfour children\u2019s clarity of speech has improved. Ulrich testified that the children\n\nhave made good progress after being placed with David and Georgia, and David\n\nsaid that the children are performing school work far above the level at which\n\nthey performed when they were removed from Bobbie\u2019s home. David said that\n\nhe and Georgia are prepared to raise the four children until their father is able\n\nto care for them, or until adulthood otherwise.\n\n      J.R. and L.R. have been with a foster family since April 6, 2006. 6 Their\n\nfoster mother testified that when the family received the children, J.R.\n\ncommunicated by screaming, pointing, and grunting; after twice-a-month\n\nspeech therapy sessions, J.R. can now speak. L.R. was on medications for\n\nbreathing problems and projectile vomiting, but he is now medication free.\n\nFletcher noted that the shape of L.R.\u2019s head has improved and attributes his\n\nweight gain to a diet of formula instead of evaporated milk. J.R. and L.R.\u2019s\n\nfoster mother said that she and her husband are committed to adopting the\n\nchildren.\n\n      Considering the evidence in light of the applicable Holley factors and\n\nunder the appropriate standards of review, we hold that the evidence is both\n\n\n      6\n       \u2026 Like their siblings, J.R. and L.R. were in other foster homes before\nbeing placed in the home where they were living at the time of trial.\n\n                                       21\n\flegally and factually sufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings that termination of\n\nBobbie\u2019s parental rights is in the best interest of each of the children. See\n\nHolley, 544 S.W.2d at 371\u201372; In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d at 573; In re C.H.,\n\n89 S.W.3d at 28. We overrule Bobbie\u2019s fifth issue.\n\nIII.   Ruldolph and Minnie\u2019s issues 7\n\n       In their first and second issues, Rudolph and Minnie challenge the legal\n\nand factual sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings that the\n\nDepartment, rather than Rudolph and Minnie, should be named as the\n\npermanent managing conservators for J.R. and L.R. and that Rudolph and\n\nMinnie should not be named as possessory conservators of any of the six\n\nchildren.   In their third issue, they argue that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to show that the jury\u2019s findings are in the children\u2019s best\n\ninterest.\n\n       Under family code section 153.005, a trial court may appoint a sole\n\nmanaging conservator or joint managing conservators. T EX. F AM. C ODE A NN.\n\n\u00a7 153.005(a) (Vernon Supp. 2007). Section 153.006 allows a trial court to\n\n\n       7\n       \u2026 Ruldolph and Minnie attached as appendices to their brief several\ndocuments that do not appear in the record. We cannot consider documents\nattached to an appellate brief that do not appear in the record. Till v. Thomas,\n10 S.W.3d 730, 733 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.). This\ncourt must hear and determine a case based on the record as filed and may not\nconsider documents attached as exhibits to briefs. Id.\n\n                                        22\n\fappoint one or more possessory conservators if it appoints a managing\n\nconservator. Id. \u00a7 153.006 (Vernon Supp. 2007). \u201cThe best interest of the\n\nchild shall always be the primary consideration of the court in determining the\n\nissues of conservatorship and possession of and access to the child.\u201d            Id.\n\n\u00a7   153.002    (Vernon    Supp.    2007).      When     determining    matters   of\n\nconservatorship, courts may apply the Holley factors to determine the child\u2019s\n\nbest interest. See Blackwell v. Humble,          241 S.W.3d 707, 723 (Tex.\n\nApp.\u2014Austin 2007); Vazquez v. Vazquez, No. 14-05-01257-CV, 2007 WL\n\n1745324, at *3 (Tex.

(all\n\napplying Holley factors to conservatorship issues).\n\n      In a jury trial, a trial court may not render an order in contravention of the\n\njury\u2019s findings. T EX. F AM. C ODE A NN. \u00a7 105.002(c)(1)(A) (Vernon Supp. 2007).\n\nWe review jury findings underlying a conservatorship appointment under the\n\nordinary legal and factual sufficiency review, not under the \u201cclear and\n\nconvincing\u201d standard applicable to termination proceedings. In re J.A.J., 2007\n\nWL 3230169, at *6 & n.5 (Tex. 2007).\n\n      We may sustain a legal sufficiency challenge only when (1) the record\n\ndiscloses a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred\n\nby rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered\n\n                                        23\n\fto prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more\n\nthan a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite\n\nof a vital fact.

In determining whether there is legally sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the finding under review, we must consider evidence favorable to the\n\nfinding if a reasonable fact-finder could and disregard evidence contrary to the\n\nfinding unless a reasonable fact-finder could not. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168\n\nS.W.3d 802, 807, 827 (Tex. 2005).\n\n      An assertion that the evidence is factually insufficient to support a fact\n\nfinding means that the evidence supporting the finding is so weak or the\n\nevidence to the contrary is so overwhelming that the answer should be set\n\naside and a new trial ordered. Garza v. Alviar, 395 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex.\n\n1965). We are required to consider all of the evidence in the case in making\n\nthis determination, not just the evidence that supports the finding.         Mar.\n\nOverseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406-07 (Tex.), cert. denied, 525 U.S.\n\n1017 (1998).\n\n      In addition to the evidence recounted above, Rudolph and Minnie point to\n\nthe following evidence in support of their legal and factual insufficiency issues.\n\n                                       24\n\fMinnie testified that Bobbie and the children always had access to the bathroom\n\nand running water in Minnie\u2019s trailer\u2014even when Minnie and Rudolph were out\n\nof town because they would leave the trailer unlocked. Registered nurse Kim\n\nFrenette testified that when L.R was in the hospital, Minnie helped Frenette\n\ncare for L.R., appeared concerned about his well-being, held him, and fed him\n\nhis bottle. Minnie testified that when the school called her about the children\u2019s\n\nlice infestation, she treated their hair with a commercial lice treatment and that\n\nthey never had lice when they were living in her home.             David G. and\n\nDepartment workers Shelby Johnson and Amie Fletcher testified that Minnie\u2019s\n\nvisits with the children were \u201cappropriate\u201d and that Minnie was \u201cnurturing.\u201d\n\nMinnie also provided food for the children during visitations and made clothing\n\nfor them for Christmas and Easter.\n\n      The Department notes that Johnson also testified that Minnie \u201cwas very\n\nquick to make excuses\u201d for Bobbie when Bobbie acted inappropriately during\n\nvisitations and that the lives of the children did not improve while Minnie was\n\ninvolved unless the Department was also actively involved. Minnie and Rudolph\n\ntold Department caseworker Hiza that they had no concerns about Bobbie\u2019s\n\nparenting ability. Minnie testified that she and Randolph were financially unable\n\nto furnish formula for L.R. when Bobbie was feeding him evaporated milk.\n\nWhen asked how she could afford to take a vacation but not help provide\n\n                                       25\n\fnecessities for the children, Minnie testified that it was not her responsibility to\n\nprovide for them.\n\n      Considering all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s\n\nverdict on managing and possessory conservatorship, we hold that there is not\n\na complete lack of evidence of a vital fact and that the evidence does not\n\nconclusively establish the opposite of a vital fact; thus, the evidence is legally\n\nsufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. See Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., 977\n\nS.W.2d at 334. Nor is the evidence supporting the verdict so weak or the\n\nevidence to the contrary so overwhelming that the answer should be set aside\n\nand a new trial ordered; thus, the evidence is factually sufficient. See Garza,\n\n395 S.W.2d at 823. Therefore, we overrule Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s first three\n\nissues.\n\n      In their fourth issue, Rudolph and Minnie argue that their retained trial\n\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to cross-examine the\n\nphysician who treated L.R., failing to offer photographs of the children and\n\nmedical records pertaining to J.R. as evidence, and failing to call Rudolph to\n\ntestify. In Texas, there is a statutory right to counsel for indigent parents in\n\nparental-rights termination cases, and this right embodies the right to effective\n\ncounsel.    In re M.S., 115 S.W.3d at 544; see T EX. F AM. C ODE A NN.\n\n\u00a7 107.013(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2007). But the statute provides that this right\n\n                                        26\n\fonly applies to the parents of the child that is the subject of the termination.\n\nIn re J.S., No. 02-04-00277-CV, 2005 WL 1693537, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort\n\nWorth July 21, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.).           Rudolph and Minnie cite no\n\nauthority to support their claim that a grandparent intervenor in a parental\n\ntermination suit has a constitutional or statutory right to effective assistance of\n\ncounsel.   Because they had neither a constitutional nor statutory right to\n\ncounsel, they cannot raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we\n\noverrule their fourth issue. See id. (holding great-grandparent intervenor who\n\nsought to be appointed managing conservator of child had no constitutional or\n\nstatutory right to counsel and could not raise ineffective-assistance claim on\n\nappeal).\n\n      Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s fifth issue is \u201c[w]hether there is a legal ruling about\n\nperson #1 questioning person #2 in a hospital and person #2 is taking pain\n\nmedication.\u201d Their entire argument under this issue comprises the following\n\ntwo sentences: \u201cMichelle Hiza, TDFPS case worker, in January 2006,\n\ninterviewed [Minnie] at the hospital. She stated that [Minnie] was a patient at\n\nthe hospital.\u201d\n\n      An issue on appeal unsupported by argument or citation to any legal\n\nauthority presents nothing for the court to review.

Stephenson, 919\n\nS.W.2d 454, 467 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1996, writ denied); see also Fredonia\n\nState Bank v. Gen. Am. Life Ins.

Therefore, we overrule their\n\nfifth issue as inadequately briefed.\n\nIV.

Appellants Minnie B. and Rudolph B., pro\n\nse\u2014Bobbie\u2019s mother and her husband\u2014challenge the legal and factual\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support the jury\u2019s findings that Minnie and\n\n\n      1\n          \u2026 See T EX. R. A PP. P. 47.4.\n\fRudolph should not be named managing conservators of two of the children or\n\npossessory conservators of any of the six children. We affirm.\n\nI.    Background\n\n      The following summary of the evidence will put the issues into context.\n\nWe will discuss the evidence in greater detail later in this opinion as it pertains\n\nto the individual issues.\n\n      Bobbie is twenty-eight years old and the mother of six children: twins\n\nB.M. and S.M., age eight; R.M., age five; J.M., age four; J.R., age three; and\n\nL.R., age two.2 School teachers, daycare workers, and medical professionals\n\nmade at least ten reports concerning the children\u2019s welfare to the Department\n\nof Family and Prospective Services (\u201cthe Department\u201d) between 2003 and the\n\ntime of trial.   Those reports, and the Department\u2019s investigation of and\n\nresponse to same, included the following incidents.\n\n      In October 2004, the Department investigated a report that S.M. had a\n\nblack eye. When the Department and the Denton County Sheriff\u2019s Office went\n\nto the family\u2019s trailer home to investigate, they found the home in an unlivable\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        \u2026 Sherman M. is the father of the four older children, and Stephen R. is\nthe father of the two younger children. Stephen did not appear or otherwise\nrespond to the Department\u2019s petition to terminate his parental rights, and the\ntrial court terminated his rights. The Department did not seek to terminate\nSherman\u2019s parental rights.\n\n                                        2\n\fcondition. Michael Hendrix, a sheriff\u2019s office investigator, testified that the\n\nfloor had holes in it, there was no running water, electricity was supplied by an\n\nextension cord running from Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s trailer next door, the stove\n\nand heating unit were inoperable, and the family shared the trailer with two\n\ncats and four dogs. Bobbie did, however, have a hotplate and an electric oven\n\nto prepare meals. The children had head lice, which Bobbie was attempting to\n\ntreat with mayonnaise and vinegar or alcohol, but she was not treating the\n\nchildren\u2019s bedding or clothing. The Department did not remove the children;\n\ninstead, it implemented a temporary safety plan under which the children were\n\nto stay with Rudolph and Minnie while Bobbie repaired the trailer; the\n\nDepartment paid for the repairs. Bobbie and the children moved back into the\n\ntrailer when the repairs were complete.\n\n      In August 2005, Bobbie took L.R.\u2014who was two months old and had not\n\nseen a doctor since birth\u2014to the health department. L.R. had an infection\n\nunder his neck where baby formula had been allowed to build up. Also, his\n\nfingernails were too long, allowing him to scratch himself; the back of his head\n\nwas flattened from lying on his back excessively; and he had a bad diaper rash.\n\nThe health department reported L.R.\u2019s condition to the Department, and the\n\nDepartment placed L.R. and J.R. with Rudolph and Minnie for thirty days.\n\nDepartment caseworker Dayana Alcazar inspected Bobbie\u2019s trailer on August\n\n                                       3\n\f12 and found it to be very dirty. Alcazar visited the home again on September\n\n2 and found the trailer to be very clean; but when she visited a third time on\n\nSeptember 16, the condition was not as good, and she found cat feces on the\n\nfloor where L.R. was playing.\n\n      In November 2005, Bonnie\u2019s electricity was cut off due to nonpayment,\n\nand she and the children moved into Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s trailer, where they\n\nslept on a porch that had been converted into a bedroom.            The small,\n\nwindowless room was heated by a space heater on a shelf, and Bobbie would\n\nsmoke in the room with the six children present. Bobbie and the children slept\n\non a porch glider, two cribs, and a mattress on the floor. Minnie testified that\n\nshe slept in the room with the children when Bobbie was working the night shift\n\nat the waffle house where she was employed.\n\n      On December 25, 2005, Bobbie took L.R. to the hospital because he was\n\nhaving difficulty breathing. L.R. was hospitalized with pneumonia, and the\n\nhospital reported to the Department that Bobbie had been feeding L.R.\n\nevaporated milk instead of formula.     Department caseworker Michelle Hiza\n\ninvestigated the referral.   W hen Hiza went to the hospital, Bobbie was not\n\nthere; but Hiza was able to interview Minnie\u2014 who also happened to be\n\nhospitalized at the time\u2014and Rudolph, who was sitting with L.R. Rudolph told\n\nher that he thought Bobbie was a very good mom and that he had no concern\n\n                                       4\n\fabout Bobbie\u2019s feeding L.R. a mixture of evaporated milk and water. Likewise,\n\nMinnie told Hiza that she thought Bobbie was a good mom and that she had no\n\nconcerns about the children\u2019s care.        Hiza interviewed Bobbie the next day.\n\nBobbie told her that she was feeding evaporated milk and water to L.R. because\n\nhe could not keep whole milk or formula down. Hiza testified that Bobbie was\n\n\u201cangry, screaming, [and] yelling\u201d during the interview and used a lot of\n\nprofanity. When Bobbie stayed in the hospital with L.R., the nurses had to\n\nwake her up when L.R. was crying and ask her to take care of him; on one\n\noccasion, Bobbie rolled over and went back to sleep. When she fed L.R. in the\n\nhospital, she sometimes propped L.R. up with a bottle so that he could feed\n\nhimself.\n\n      Further   investigation   by   the   Department   revealed   the   following\n\ninformation:\n\n      \u2022     Dennis K., Bobbie\u2019s boyfriend, moved in with Bobbie and the\n            children in December 2005. Dennis had recently been\n            released from prison and had a history of assault and family\n            violence. The record is not clear about how long Dennis lived\n            with Bobbie.\n\n      \u2022     When B.M. and S.M. began kindergarten, B.M.\u2019s speech was\n            unintelligible and she communicated with grunts; S.M.\u2019s\n            verbal skills were better but still below average for her age.\n\n      \u2022     B.M. and S.M. often went to school dirty and wearing ill-\n            fitting or inappropriate clothes and shoes.\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      \u2022     When Hiza visited R.M., B.M., and S.M. at school, she found\n            their speech unintelligible; she testified that they \u201creally had\n            their own kind of language.\u201d\n\n      \u2022     Hiza also testified that R.M.\u2019s stomach was distended and\n            looked \u201cvery unusual.\u201d Hiza later saw J.M. and J.R. and\n            observed that their stomachs also \u201ckind of protruded out.\u201d\n\n      The Department removed all six children on January 3, 2006. The trial\n\ncourt signed an order implementing a service plan for Bobbie on January 27,\n\n2006. Bobbie completed a psychological evaluation with Dr. Mark Foster, who\n\ntestified that she functioned emotionally on the level of a mid- to early\n\nadolescent. Dr. Foster recommended that she take anger management classes,\n\nbut Bobbie did not attend the classes. The trial court ordered Bobbie to attend\n\nweekly counseling sessions with therapist Michelle Greer; Bobbie met with\n\nGreer six times then missed several appointments, cursed at Greer over the\n\nphone, and refused to attend any more sessions. Bobbie testified that she\n\nstopped attending the sessions because she could not pay the fee Greer\n\ncharged her for missed sessions (the Department paid for the sessions Bobbie\n\nactually attended), but Greer testified that she charged the missed-session fee\n\nin an attempt to make Bobbie feel as though the therapy had value and that\n\nBobbie refused to attend any more sessions even after Greer offered to reduce\n\nthe missed-session fee and let Bobbie pay it out over time. Bobbie completed\n\nher MHMR assessment and participated in in-home parenting classes as\n\n                                        6\n\fordered; but CASA advocate Vicky Ulrich testified that the classes had no\n\neffect on her parenting ability. Bobbie maintained housing and employment, but\n\nshe stopped making child support payments a year before trial.\n\n      Bobbie visited the children regularly while all six were in foster care in the\n\nDenton area.    Department workers\u2019 written descriptions of the visitations\n\nspotlight the Department\u2019s concerns with Bobbie\u2019s parental abilities:\n\n      \u2022     Bobbie found a cup half-full of an unidentified liquid in the\n            conference room where the visitation occurred; she emptied\n            the cup and\u2014without washing it\u2014filled it with apple juice; all\n            of the children shared the cup for the duration of the visit;\n\n      \u2022     She lifted L.R. off the floor by one wrist to stop him from\n            pushing J.R.\u2019s chair;\n\n      \u2022     When J.R. attempted to walk out of the visitation room, she\n            grabbed him by the wrist and pushed him to the floor;\n\n      \u2022     She frequently \u201cyelled and screamed\u201d at Department workers\n            during the visits;\n\n      \u2022     She \u201cmade a big deal about the children eat[ing] all the sugar\n            so they could be \u2018hyper\u2019 when they go back\u201d to their foster\n            homes;\n\n      \u2022     She did not attempt to redirect the children when they\n            engaged in inappropriate behavior, such as climbing on\n            cabinets, playing with electrical outlets, and taking toys from\n            one another;\n\n      \u2022     She allowed the children to listen to sexually suggestive song\n            lyrics on her cell phone;\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f      \u2022     She lifted L.R. by his upper arm and argued with a\n            Department worker who told her that lifting L.R. that way\n            might dislocate his shoulder; a few minutes later, she jerked\n            J.R. by his upper arm;\n\n      \u2022     She mocked J.R. by screaming at him when J.R. cried or lost\n            his temper; and\n\n      \u2022     She sometimes arrived late and twice left one hour into the\n            two-hour visitation.\n\n      After the four older children were placed with relatives in Wichita Falls,\n\nBobbie visited them only three times in a ten-month period. Bobbie testified\n\nthat she could not visit the children in Wichita Falls because her truck broke\n\ndown, but she also testified that her mother would provide transportation for\n\nthe visits. The children\u2019s foster father testified that on one visit in Wichita\n\nFalls, Bobbie spent thirty or forty minutes with the children, then left to meet\n\nwith friends. The two younger children remained in foster care in Denton, and\n\nalthough Bobbie was scheduled to visit them twice a month, she visited them\n\nonly six times in the ten months following July 2006.\n\n      At trial, Bobbie testified, \u201cI don\u2019t want my children back with me. I can\u2019t\n\ntake care of them\u201d and \u201cI just want visitation.\u201d The jury found that Bobbie had\n\nviolated subsections (D), (E), (N), and (O)3 of family code section 161.001(1);\n\n\n      3\n       \u2026 The jury\u2019s findings on subsections (D), (E), and (N) were unanimous.\nThe jury split eleven to one on the subsection (O) findings with regard to each\nchild.\n\n                                       8\n\fthat termination of Bobbie\u2019s parental rights was in the children\u2019s best interest;\n\nthat the Department should be named as permanent managing conservator of\n\nJ.R. and L.R.; and that Rudolph and Minnie\u2014who intervened in the termination\n\nproceeding\u2014should not be named possessory conservators of any of the\n\nchildren. The trial court terminated Bobbie\u2019s parental rights and appointed the\n\nDepartment as the children\u2019s permanent managing conservator. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.

Also at\n            the time of trial, Dennis was under indictment for a drug\n            charge and a family violence assault charge.\n\n      Bobbie also exhibited potentially endangering behavior during supervised\n\nvisitations with the children after the Department removed them from her home,\n\nincluding the following:\n\n      \u2022     During one visitation, Bobbie\u2014 who was talking on her cell\n            phone\u2014grabbed J.R. by the wrist and pushed him back into\n            the visitation room; J.R. hit his head on the television stand;\n\n      \u2022     On one occasion, Bobbie found a half-filled cup by the sink\n            in the visitation room; she poured its contents down the sink,\n\n\n                                      16\n\f            filled the cup with apple juice, and let all six children drink\n            out of it for the duration of the visit;\n\n      \u2022     All Bobbie provided for the children\u2019s lunch during one visit\n            was a loaf of white bread;\n\n      \u2022     On one occasion, Bobbie lifted L.R. by one wrist; on another\n            occasion, she lifted him over a chair by one arm;\n\n      \u2022     Bobbie allowed the children to play with potentially\n            dangerous objects during the visitations, such as electrical\n            outlets, and left the baby, L.R., on the floor where he could\n            get knocked over by the other children.\n\n      Bobbie argues that while at times her home was dirty and her children\n\nwere unkempt and had head lice, at other times her home and children were\n\nrelatively clean. But a more accurate assessment of the record shows\u2014as the\n\nState argues\u2014that conditions would improve while the Department was\n\nactively involved in Bobbie\u2019s life, then deteriorate when its involvement ended.\n\n      Viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we\n\nhold a fact-finder could reasonably form a firm belief or conviction that Bobbie\n\nendangered the children.    See In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d at 573. Thus, the\n\nevidence is legally sufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings that Bobbie violated\n\nfamily code sections 161.001(1)(D) and (E). We further hold that the evidence\n\nis factually sufficient to support the findings. See In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d at 28.\n\nWe overrule Bobbie\u2019s first and second issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                       17\n\f      Having determined that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to\n\nsupport the jury\u2019s findings under sections 161.001(1)(D) and (E), we do not\n\nreach her third and fourth issues, in which she argues that the evidence is\n\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings under sections\n\n161.001(1)(N) and (O).

Id.\n\n      Michelle Greer, a therapist with whom Bobbie attended six counseling\n\nsessions as a part of her service plan,4 testified that Bobbie was not concerned\n\n\n\n\n      4\n       \u2026 Greer testified that after six appointments, Bobbie got angry, cursed\nat Greer over the phone, and told Greer that she would not attend counseling\nany longer.\n\n                                        19\n\fwith the children\u2019s condition when the Department removed them from her\n\nhome and therefore did not feel that she needed to make any changes in the\n\nway she cared for them. Ulrich\u2014the CASA advocate\u2014testified that Bobbie did\n\nnot comply with techniques that were taught in the parenting class that Bobbie\n\ntook, and the class seemed to have no effect on her progress. Ulrich testified\n\nthat Bobbie never accepted responsibility for her children\u2019s removal and that her\n\nrefusal to do so was a \u201chuge problem\u201d because \u201cif you don\u2019t think that there\u2019s\n\na problem, you can\u2019t fix it.\u201d Department conservatorship worker Amie Fletcher\n\ntestified that Bobbie failed to exhibit adequate parenting skills during supervised\n\nvisitations   and   showed   no   improvement after her parenting           classes.\n\nConservatorship worker Shelby Johnson testified that Bobbie expressed an\n\noverall lack of interest in raising the children and providing for their basic needs.\n\n      After removing the children from Bobbie\u2019s home, the Department\n\neventually placed J.M., R.M., S.M., and B.M. with David and Georgia G., who\n\nare relatives of their biological father, Sherman M.5 When David and Georgia\n\nreceived the children, J.M. and R.M. did not know how to feed themselves and\n\nS.M. and B.M. had no concept of how to brush their teeth.

David said that\n\nhe and Georgia are prepared to raise the four children until their father is able\n\nto care for them, or until adulthood otherwise.\n\n      J.R. and L.R. have been with a foster family since April 6, 2006. 6 Their\n\nfoster mother testified that when the family received the children, J.R.\n\ncommunicated by screaming, pointing, and grunting; after twice-a-month\n\nspeech therapy sessions, J.R. can now speak. L.R. was on medications for\n\nbreathing problems and projectile vomiting, but he is now medication free.\n\nFletcher noted that the shape of L.R.\u2019s head has improved and attributes his\n\nweight gain to a diet of formula instead of evaporated milk.

Minnie testified that she and Randolph were financially unable\n\nto furnish formula for L.R. when Bobbie was feeding him evaporated milk.\n\nWhen asked how she could afford to take a vacation but not help provide\n\n                                       25\n\fnecessities for the children, Minnie testified that it was not her responsibility to\n\nprovide for them.\n\n      Considering all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s\n\nverdict on managing and possessory conservatorship, we hold that there is not\n\na complete lack of evidence of a vital fact and that the evidence does not\n\nconclusively establish the opposite of a vital fact; thus, the evidence is legally\n\nsufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. See Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., 977\n\nS.W.2d at 334. Nor is the evidence supporting the verdict so weak or the\n\nevidence to the contrary so overwhelming that the answer should be set aside\n\nand a new trial ordered; thus, the evidence is factually sufficient. See Garza,\n\n395 S.W.2d at 823. Therefore, we overrule Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s first three\n\nissues.\n\n      In their fourth issue, Rudolph and Minnie argue that their retained trial\n\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to cross-examine the\n\nphysician who treated L.R., failing to offer photographs of the children and\n\nmedical records pertaining to J.R. as evidence, and failing to call Rudolph to\n\ntestify. In Texas, there is a statutory right to counsel for indigent parents in\n\nparental-rights termination cases, and this right embodies the right to effective\n\ncounsel.    In re M.S., 115 S.W.3d at 544; see T EX. F AM. C ODE A NN.\n\n\u00a7 107.013(a)(1) (Vernon Supp. 2007). But the statute provides that this right\n\n                                        26\n\fonly applies to the parents of the child that is the subject of the termination.\n\nIn re J.S., No. 02-04-00277-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1693537</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort\n\nWorth July 21, 2005, no pet.) (mem. op.).           Rudolph and Minnie cite no\n\nauthority to support their claim that a grandparent intervenor in a parental\n\ntermination suit has a constitutional or statutory right to effective assistance of\n\ncounsel.   Because they had neither a constitutional nor statutory right to\n\ncounsel, they cannot raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we\n\noverrule their fourth issue. See id. (holding great-grandparent intervenor who\n\nsought to be appointed managing conservator of child had no constitutional or\n\nstatutory right to counsel and could not raise ineffective-assistance claim on\n\nappeal).\n\n      Rudolph and Minnie\u2019s fifth issue is \u201c[w]hether there is a legal ruling about\n\nperson #1 questioning person #2 in a hospital and person #2 is taking pain\n\nmedication.\u201d Their entire argument under this issue comprises the following\n\ntwo sentences: \u201cMichelle Hiza, TDFPS case worker, in January 2006,\n\ninterviewed [Minnie] at the hospital.
