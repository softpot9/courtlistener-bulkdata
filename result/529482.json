Rogler appeals the district court's December 22, 1988, order allowing discovery of her psychiatric records unless she states that she will not challenge the defendant psychiatrists' diagnoses of her.  We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 this Court has jurisdiction over appeals from final orders.  A final order is one which disposes of all issues in dispute as to all parties.  It \"ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\"    Catlin v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104095\"><a href=\"/opinion/104095/catlin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span>, 233 (1945).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the order appealed from is not a final order, it is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.  The district court has not directed entry of final judgment as to particular claims or parties under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), nor is the order appealable under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>   Finally, the order is not appealable as a collateral order under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104695\"><a href=\"/opinion/104695/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span> (1949).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rogler also seems to request a writ of mandamus prohibiting the district court from requiring her to disclose her psychiatric records.  The standards for granting a writ of mandamus are set forth in In re Beard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"483262\"><a href=\"/opinion/483262/in-re-diana-r-beard-two-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span> (4th Cir.1987):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The granting of a writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary situations.  A writ of mandamus will not issue when all that is shown is that the district court abused its discretion when making the challenged ruling.  The party seeking mandamus relief carries the heavy burden of showing that he has no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires and that his right to such relief is clear and indisputable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 826 (citations omitted).  Rogler has not satisfied this demanding standard here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finding no basis for appellate jurisdiction, we grant the appellees' motion to dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.  To the extent that Rogler's filings in this Court could be construed as a petition for a writ of mandamus, the petition is also denied, as are all of Rogler's pending motions in this case.  We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and oral argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DISMISSED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Rogler states that she has asked the district court to certify an interlocutory appeal under Sec. 1292(b).  Should the district court decide to amend its December 22 order to grant Sec. 1292(b) certification, Rogler will be able to petition this Court for an interlocutory appeal at that time.
