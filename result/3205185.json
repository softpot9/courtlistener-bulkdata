Accordingly, we affirm the\n\nJudgment of Sentence.\n\n                     Factual and Procedural History\n\n      This is Appellant\u2019s second conviction and appeal to this Court for the\n\nsame underlying offense.    This Court previously vacated Appellant\u2019s initial\n\nconvictions and remanded for a new trial after concluding that the trial court\n\nhad failed to elicit a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of counsel\n\nfrom Appellant before permitting him to proceed pro se in his first trial. See\n\nCommonwealth v. Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855 (Pa. Super. 2014). At his\n\nre-trial, Appellant again elected to represent himself pro se. That jury also\n\nconvicted Appellant. The facts and procedural history are as follows.\n\n      On December 22, 2011, officers of the Harrisburg City Police\n\nDepartment responded to a 911 call from a female screaming for help and\n\nstating that someone was trying to kill her. Id. at 849. Officers responded\n\nto a boarding house and followed the sounds of a screaming female to the\n\nsecond floor, where they encountered Appellant breathing rapidly as he\n\nwalked out of a bedroom. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n     In the bedroom that Appellant had just vacated, officers found Jasmine\n\nMatthews (\u201cMatthews\u201d), who was \u201ccrying, breathing very hard, and had\n\nblood coming from her nose and mouth.\u201d          Id.   The visibly distraught\n\nMatthews told officers that Appellant had repeatedly struck her with his fists\n\nand with a gun. N.T. Suppression, 11/13/14, at 20-21. Matthews showed\n\nofficers the gun Appellant used to strike her, a .32 caliber Colt gray top\n\naction revolver located under the foot of the bed. Phillips, supra at 849.\n\n     Officers discovered Appellant had a warrant out for his arrest, and took\n\nhim into custody. Id. While searching Appellant incident to arrest, officers\n\ndiscovered Appellant was wearing a Kevlar vest with ammunition for a .32\n\ncaliber firearm in the pocket. Id. Appellant was charged with one count of\n\nPersons Not to Possess Firearm, one count of Possessing an Instrument of\n\nCrime \u2013 Unlawful Body Armor, and one count of Simple Assault.\n\n     As noted above, Appellant represented himself pro se in his first trial.\n\nAfter a jury convicted him of the two possession charges and acquitted him\n\nof the simple assault, Appellant appealed to this Court alleging, inter alia,\n\nthat his waiver of counsel had not been knowing, voluntary and intelligent.\n\nThis Court agreed, finding none of the waiver-of-counsel colloquies given by\n\nthe trial court satisfied the minimum requirements under Pa.R.Crim.P. 121.\n\nId. at 852-55. We remanded for a new trial on the possession charges only.\n\n     On October 7, 2014, Appellant filed two motions pro se: (1) a Motion\n\nto Proceed Pro Se citing a disagreement in trial strategy between Appellant\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nand his appointed counsel; and (2) a Motion to Suppress challenging the\n\nofficer\u2019s warrantless entry into the boarding house and the subsequent\n\nseizure of the firearm discovered therein.\n\n      On November 13, 2014 the Honorable Scott Arthur Evans held a\n\nhearing on both Motions.     At the commencement of the hearing, the trial\n\ncourt presided over a waiver-of-counsel hearing of Appellant on the record\n\nbefore granting Appellant\u2019s Motion to Proceed Pro Se and appointing standby\n\ncounsel. N.T. Suppression, 11/13/14, at 3-12. The parties then proceeded\n\nwith testimony on the Motion to Suppress, which Judge Evans denied at the\n\nclose of the hearing.\n\n      A two-day jury trial began on March 11, 2015. Prior to jury selection,\n\nAppellant presented the trial court with a Motion in Limine challenging the\n\nadmissibility of (1) Appellant\u2019s prior criminal record, (2) a recording of a\n\nprison phone conversation, and (3) the content of the 911 call from\n\nMatthews. Appellant challenged the 911 call, in which Matthews states \u201cHe\n\nis trying to kill me,\u201d as irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial given the absence\n\nof assault charges against Appellant on remand.\n\n      The trial court denied Appellant\u2019s Motion in Limine, and then conducted\n\na second waiver-of-counsel hearing of Appellant on the record before\n\nproceeding with jury selection and trial.\n\n      The jury convicted Appellant of both possession charges. Judge Evans\n\nsubsequently sentenced Appellant to five to ten years of incarceration for\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nPersons Not to Possess Firearms, and a consecutive one to four years\n\nsentence for Unlawful Body Armor. Appellant filed a pro se post-sentence\n\nmotion on April 8, 2015. The next day, counsel entered an appearance on\n\nbehalf of Appellant and filed an amended post-sentence motion. The court\n\ndenied the Motion on April 13, 2015.      Appellant timely appealed.      Both\n\nAppellant and the trial court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n                         Issues Raised on Appeal\n\n     Appellant raised the following alleged errors in his counseled Rule\n\n1925(b) Statement:\n\n     1. [The trial court] erred by failing to conduct a complete and\n     thorough, on-the-record colloquy of Appellant before allowing\n     him to proceed to his suppression hearing and trial pro se in\n     violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. Rule 121, resulting in an unknowing,\n     involuntary, and unintelligent waiver of his right to counsel\n     under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\n     Constitution and Articles I and V, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania\n     Constitution.\n\n     2. [The trial court] erred in admitting evidence of the 911 call\n     where such was irrelevant to the underlying charges, and where\n     any probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair\n     prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury.\n\n     3. [The trial court] erred in admitting the victim's statement to\n     police where the statement constituted inadmissible hearsay not\n     subject to any exception.\n\n     4. [The trial court] erred in denying Appellant's Post-Sentence\n     Motion where his sentence is excessive and unreasonable and\n     constitutes too severe a punishment in light of the gravity of the\n     offense, Appellant's rehabilitative needs, and what is needed to\n     protect the public.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Statement of Errors Complained of Upon Appeal Pursuant to\n\nPA.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n      Appellant\u2019s Statement of Questions Presented in his counseled Brief to\n\nthis Court raises two issues on appeal:\n\n      a. Did not the lower court fail to insure that [Appellant\u2019s] waiver\n      of his right to counsel was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent\n      when it failed to conduct a waiver-of-counsel colloquy at a\n      critical stage of the proceedings and when the two colloquies\n      that it did conduct were insufficient under the standards of\n      Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(A)(2)?\n\n      b. Did the trial court err in denying [Appellant\u2019s] Motion In\n      Limine to exclude as irrelevant certain out-of-court declarations\n      of the alleged victim of the simple assault when the defendant\n      had been acquitted of the simple assault at the first jury trial and\n      when it was unnecessary for the Commonwealth at the second\n      trial to introduce a detailed account of the alleged assault?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 5 (capitalization omitted).\n\n                         Waiver of Counsel Claims\n\n      Although stated as a single question in his brief to this Court,\n\nAppellant\u2019s waiver-of-counsel claim consists of two distinct arguments. First,\n\nAppellant avers that the trial court was required to advise him of the\n\napplicable sentencing guidelines prior to finding Appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel\n\nwas knowing, voluntary and intelligent.      Second, Appellant avers that the\n\ntrial court was required to conduct a new waiver-of-counsel colloquy prior to\n\nhearing Appellant\u2019s Motion in Limine.\n\n      The right to counsel and the corresponding right to self-representation\n\nare deeply entrenched in both state and federal law. As our Supreme Court\n\nhas made clear:\n\n      [i]t is . . . firmly established that an accused has a constitutional\n      right to counsel during trial. While an accused may waive his\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n        constitutional right, such a waiver must be the free and\n        unconstrained choice of its maker, and also must be made\n        knowingly and intelligently. To be a knowing and intelligent\n        waiver defendant must be aware of both the right and of the\n        risks of forfeiting that right.\n\nCommonwealth v. Tyler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2309547\"><a href=\"/opinion/2309547/commonwealth-v-tyler/\"><span class=\"volume\">360</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (Pa. 1976) (citations and\n\nquotations omitted).     Deprivation of the right to counsel, or the right to\n\nwaive counsel, can never be harmless.        Commonwealth v. Payson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102545\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102545/commonwealth-v-payson/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 699\u2013700 (Pa. Super. 1999). Moreover,\n\n        the presumption must always be against the waiver of a\n        constitutional right. Nor can waiver be presumed where the\n        record is silent. The record must show, or there must be an\n        allegation and evidence which shows, that an accused was\n        offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the\n        offer. Anything less is not waiver.\n\nCommonwealth v. Monica, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1527933\"><a href=\"/opinion/1527933/com-v-monica/\"><span class=\"volume\">597</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (Pa. 1991).\n\n        Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 121 outlines additional\n\nrequirements for a valid waiver-of-counsel colloquy. It states, in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n        Rule 121. Waiver of Counsel\n\n        (A) Generally.\n\n        (1) The defendant may waive the right to be represented by\n        counsel.\n\n        (2) To ensure that the defendant's waiver of the right to counsel\n        is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, the judge or issuing\n        authority, at a minimum, shall elicit the following information\n        from the defendant:\n\n             (a) that the defendant understands that he ... has\n             the right to be represented by counsel, and the right\n             to have free counsel appointed if the defendant is\n             indigent;\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n           (b) that the defendant understands the nature of the\n           charges against the defendant and the elements of\n           each of those charges;\n\n           (c) that the defendant is aware of the permissible\n           range of sentences and/or fines for the offenses\n           charged;\n\n           (d) that the defendant understands that if he ...\n           waives the right to counsel, the defendant will still be\n           bound by all the normal rules of procedure and that\n           counsel would be familiar with these rules;\n\n           (e) that the defendant understands that there are\n           possible defenses to these charges that counsel\n           might be aware of, and if these defenses are not\n           raised at trial, they may be lost permanently; and\n\n           (f) that the defendant understands that, in addition\n           to defenses, the defendant has many rights that, if\n           not timely asserted, may be lost permanently; and\n           that if errors occur and are not timely objected to, or\n           otherwise timely raised by the defendant, these\n           errors may be lost permanently.\n\n                                    ***\n\n     (C) Proceedings Before a Judge. When the defendant seeks\n     to waive the right to counsel after the preliminary hearing, the\n     judge shall ascertain from the defendant, on the record, whether\n     this is a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of counsel.\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 121(A)(1)-(2)(a)-(f), (C) (emphasis in original).        Finally, \u201ca\n\nwaiver colloquy must, of course, always contain a clear demonstration of the\n\ndefendant's ability to understand the questions posed to him during the\n\ncolloquy.\u201d Commonwealth v. McDonough, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2209428\"><a href=\"/opinion/2209428/com-v-mcdonough/\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 507 n. 1 (Pa.\n\n2002).\n\n     With these requirements in mind, we now turn to Appellant\u2019s waiver of\n\ncounsel claims.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n             Adequacy of the November Waiver-of-Counsel Colloquy\n\n         During the November 13, 2014 waiver-of-counsel colloquy, Appellant\n\nanswered        questions   about   his   age,   educational   background,   and\n\ncomprehension skills.       N.T. Suppression, 11/13/14, at 4.     The trial court\n\nconfirmed that Appellant understood that he had a right to counsel, including\n\nthe right to be appointed counsel free of charge in the event he could not\n\nafford an attorney. Id. The trial court confirmed that Appellant understood\n\nthe nature of the charges against him, going over both of the charges then\n\npending as well as the elements of each offense.               Id. at 4-5, 9-11.\n\nAppellant acknowledged that he understood the maximum possible penalty\n\nfor each of the offenses charged.            Id. at 5.    Appellant indicated he\n\nunderstood he would be held to the same procedural and evidentiary rules\n\nas an attorney, and that an attorney would \u201cbe more familiar\u201d with those\n\nrules.    Id.    In addition, Appellant acknowledged he might have \u201cpossible\n\ndefenses that an attorney may be aware of that if not raised at trial [could\n\nbe lost] permanently.\u201d       Id. at 6.    Finally, Appellant stated he understood\n\nthat he had many rights that he would have to assert in a timely manner or\n\navoid losing permanently, including the right to appeal errors at trial. Id.\n\n         In spite of this extensive inquiry, Appellant now argues that the\n\nwaiver-of-counsel colloquies conducted in the trial court did not comply with\n\nthe minimum standards set forth in Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(A)(2) and that\n\ntherefore Appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel was not knowing, voluntary and\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nintelligent.    In    particular,   the    Appellant    argues     that   Pa.R.Crim.P.\n\n121(A)(2)(c), which requires the trial court to advise potential pro se\n\ndefendants of the \u201cpermissible range of sentences,\u201d also required the trial\n\ncourt to advise Appellant of the sentencing guidelines applicable to his case.\n\n      Addressing Appellant\u2019s claim requires us to interpret the meaning of\n\nRule 121. The interpretation of procedural rules is a question of law, so our\n\nstandard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.\n\nCommonwealth v.

The plain language of Rule 121 does not mention that the trial court\n\nmust advise the defendant of the applicable sentencing guidelines.         Our\n\nSupreme Court is aware of the existence of sentencing guidelines, and if it\n\nwished to include the sentencing guidelines in the requirements under Rule\n\n121, it was free to do so. The Supreme Court did not.\n\n      We, thus, conclude that under the plain language of Rule 121, the trial\n\ncourt was not required to advise Appellant of the applicable sentencing\n\nguidelines prior to finding that Appellant had knowingly, voluntarily and\n\nintelligently waived his right to counsel. Therefore, Appellant is not entitled\n\nto relief on this claim.\n\n                     Duration of a Valid Waiver of Counsel\n\n      Appellant next argues that the Motion in Limine was a \u201ccritical stage,\u201d\n\nand therefore the lower court erred in hearing Appellant\u2019s Motion without\n\nfirst conducting a waiver-of-counsel colloquy.    Even assuming, arguendo,\n\nthat the Motion in Limine was a \u201ccritical stage,\u201d we have already held,\n\nsupra, that the trial court previously elicited a knowing, intelligent and\n\nvoluntary waiver of counsel from Appellant at the November 13, 2014\n\nhearing on the Motion to Suppress.       Accordingly, the relevant inquiry is\n\nwhether, and under what circumstances, the trial court has a duty to repeat\n\nthe waiver-of-counsel colloquy.\n\n      After a thorough review of the case law in this Commonwealth, we\n\nconclude this is a case of first impression.

Although\n\nthe appellant in Baker raised the issue of whether the trial court was\n\nrequired to re-colloquy the appellant prior to sentencing, this Court found\n\nthe initial waiver colloquy constitutionally inadequate, and granted relief\n\nwithout addressing the issue of re-colloquy.\n\n      Although our research yielded no controlling case law in Pennsylvania\n\non the issue of the need to repeat the colloquy, our survey of our sister\n\nstates and federal circuit courts shows that every jurisdiction but one has\n\nheld that a valid waiver of counsel is presumed to remain effective\n\nthroughout any subsequent trial proceedings absent either a revocation by\n\nthe defendant or a substantial change in circumstances.3\n\n\n2\n  Moreover, none of the cases relied upon by this Court in Phillips, supra or\nBaker holds that a waiver-of-counsel colloquy must be repeated at every\ncritical stage of the prosecution. Instead, they highlight the fact that the\nquestion of waiver may arise for the first time at various stages, and that\nwhen it arises, if ever, the court must conduct a thorough waiver-of-counsel\ncolloquy. See Phillips, 93 A.3d at 854; Baker, 464 A.2d at 499.\n3\n  Importantly, the only jurisdiction to address the issue and hold otherwise\ndid so on the basis of a state statute that explicitly requires re-colloquy at\neach subsequent stage, and not on constitutional right-to-counsel grounds.\nSee Meuhleman v.

Appellant objected to the introduction of this evidence as\n\nirrelevant and unfairly prejudicial in the pre-trial Motion in Limine discussed\n\nabove.\n\n      Second, one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses testified to statements\n\nMatthews made to the responding officers. N.T. Trial, 3/12/15, at 69-71. In\n\nher statements on scene, Matthews told officers that Appellant had struck\n\nher about her face and abdomen with his fists and with a gun. Id. When\n\nasked about the gun, Matthews directed officers to the firearm recovered\n\nfrom under the bed.     Id.

Instead, the argument section of Appellant\u2019s Brief sets forth, in\n\nsubstance, only a prior bad acts argument.

See\n\nCommonwealth v. Phillips, 93 A.3d 847, 855 (Pa. Super. 2014). At his\n\nre-trial, Appellant again elected to represent himself pro se. That jury also\n\nconvicted Appellant. The facts and procedural history are as follows.\n\n      On December 22, 2011, officers of the Harrisburg City Police\n\nDepartment responded to a 911 call from a female screaming for help and\n\nstating that someone was trying to kill her. Id. at 849. Officers responded\n\nto a boarding house and followed the sounds of a screaming female to the\n\nsecond floor, where they encountered Appellant breathing rapidly as he\n\nwalked out of a bedroom. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n     In the bedroom that Appellant had just vacated, officers found Jasmine\n\nMatthews (\u201cMatthews\u201d), who was \u201ccrying, breathing very hard, and had\n\nblood coming from her nose and mouth.\u201d          Id.   The visibly distraught\n\nMatthews told officers that Appellant had repeatedly struck her with his fists\n\nand with a gun. N.T. Suppression, 11/13/14, at 20-21. Matthews showed\n\nofficers the gun Appellant used to strike her, a .32 caliber Colt gray top\n\naction revolver located under the foot of the bed. Phillips, supra at 849.\n\n     Officers discovered Appellant had a warrant out for his arrest, and took\n\nhim into custody. Id. While searching Appellant incident to arrest, officers\n\ndiscovered Appellant was wearing a Kevlar vest with ammunition for a .32\n\ncaliber firearm in the pocket. Id. Appellant was charged with one count of\n\nPersons Not to Possess Firearm, one count of Possessing an Instrument of\n\nCrime \u2013 Unlawful Body Armor, and one count of Simple Assault.\n\n     As noted above, Appellant represented himself pro se in his first trial.\n\nAfter a jury convicted him of the two possession charges and acquitted him\n\nof the simple assault, Appellant appealed to this Court alleging, inter alia,\n\nthat his waiver of counsel had not been knowing, voluntary and intelligent.\n\nThis Court agreed, finding none of the waiver-of-counsel colloquies given by\n\nthe trial court satisfied the minimum requirements under Pa.R.Crim.P. 121.\n\nId. at 852-55. We remanded for a new trial on the possession charges only.\n\n     On October 7, 2014, Appellant filed two motions pro se: (1) a Motion\n\nto Proceed Pro Se citing a disagreement in trial strategy between Appellant\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nand his appointed counsel; and (2) a Motion to Suppress challenging the\n\nofficer\u2019s warrantless entry into the boarding house and the subsequent\n\nseizure of the firearm discovered therein.\n\n      On November 13, 2014 the Honorable Scott Arthur Evans held a\n\nhearing on both Motions.     At the commencement of the hearing, the trial\n\ncourt presided over a waiver-of-counsel hearing of Appellant on the record\n\nbefore granting Appellant\u2019s Motion to Proceed Pro Se and appointing standby\n\ncounsel. N.T. Suppression, 11/13/14, at 3-12. The parties then proceeded\n\nwith testimony on the Motion to Suppress, which Judge Evans denied at the\n\nclose of the hearing.\n\n      A two-day jury trial began on March 11, 2015. Prior to jury selection,\n\nAppellant presented the trial court with a Motion in Limine challenging the\n\nadmissibility of (1) Appellant\u2019s prior criminal record, (2) a recording of a\n\nprison phone conversation, and (3) the content of the 911 call from\n\nMatthews. Appellant challenged the 911 call, in which Matthews states \u201cHe\n\nis trying to kill me,\u201d as irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial given the absence\n\nof assault charges against Appellant on remand.\n\n      The trial court denied Appellant\u2019s Motion in Limine, and then conducted\n\na second waiver-of-counsel hearing of Appellant on the record before\n\nproceeding with jury selection and trial.\n\n      The jury convicted Appellant of both possession charges. Judge Evans\n\nsubsequently sentenced Appellant to five to ten years of incarceration for\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nPersons Not to Possess Firearms, and a consecutive one to four years\n\nsentence for Unlawful Body Armor. Appellant filed a pro se post-sentence\n\nmotion on April 8, 2015. The next day, counsel entered an appearance on\n\nbehalf of Appellant and filed an amended post-sentence motion. The court\n\ndenied the Motion on April 13, 2015.      Appellant timely appealed.      Both\n\nAppellant and the trial court complied with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.\n\n                         Issues Raised on Appeal\n\n     Appellant raised the following alleged errors in his counseled Rule\n\n1925(b) Statement:\n\n     1. [The trial court] erred by failing to conduct a complete and\n     thorough, on-the-record colloquy of Appellant before allowing\n     him to proceed to his suppression hearing and trial pro se in\n     violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. Rule 121, resulting in an unknowing,\n     involuntary, and unintelligent waiver of his right to counsel\n     under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States\n     Constitution and Articles I and V, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania\n     Constitution.\n\n     2. [The trial court] erred in admitting evidence of the 911 call\n     where such was irrelevant to the underlying charges, and where\n     any probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair\n     prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury.\n\n     3. [The trial court] erred in admitting the victim's statement to\n     police where the statement constituted inadmissible hearsay not\n     subject to any exception.\n\n     4. [The trial court] erred in denying Appellant's Post-Sentence\n     Motion where his sentence is excessive and unreasonable and\n     constitutes too severe a punishment in light of the gravity of the\n     offense, Appellant's rehabilitative needs, and what is needed to\n     protect the public.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Statement of Errors Complained of Upon Appeal Pursuant to\n\nPA.R.A.P. 1925(b).\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n      Appellant\u2019s Statement of Questions Presented in his counseled Brief to\n\nthis Court raises two issues on appeal:\n\n      a. Did not the lower court fail to insure that [Appellant\u2019s] waiver\n      of his right to counsel was knowing, voluntary, and intelligent\n      when it failed to conduct a waiver-of-counsel colloquy at a\n      critical stage of the proceedings and when the two colloquies\n      that it did conduct were insufficient under the standards of\n      Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(A)(2)?\n\n      b. Did the trial court err in denying [Appellant\u2019s] Motion In\n      Limine to exclude as irrelevant certain out-of-court declarations\n      of the alleged victim of the simple assault when the defendant\n      had been acquitted of the simple assault at the first jury trial and\n      when it was unnecessary for the Commonwealth at the second\n      trial to introduce a detailed account of the alleged assault?\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 5 (capitalization omitted).\n\n                         Waiver of Counsel Claims\n\n      Although stated as a single question in his brief to this Court,\n\nAppellant\u2019s waiver-of-counsel claim consists of two distinct arguments. First,\n\nAppellant avers that the trial court was required to advise him of the\n\napplicable sentencing guidelines prior to finding Appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel\n\nwas knowing, voluntary and intelligent.      Second, Appellant avers that the\n\ntrial court was required to conduct a new waiver-of-counsel colloquy prior to\n\nhearing Appellant\u2019s Motion in Limine.\n\n      The right to counsel and the corresponding right to self-representation\n\nare deeply entrenched in both state and federal law. As our Supreme Court\n\nhas made clear:\n\n      [i]t is . . . firmly established that an accused has a constitutional\n      right to counsel during trial. While an accused may waive his\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n        constitutional right, such a waiver must be the free and\n        unconstrained choice of its maker, and also must be made\n        knowingly and intelligently. To be a knowing and intelligent\n        waiver defendant must be aware of both the right and of the\n        risks of forfeiting that right.\n\nCommonwealth v. Tyler, 360 A.2d 617, 620 (Pa. 1976) (citations and\n\nquotations omitted).     Deprivation of the right to counsel, or the right to\n\nwaive counsel, can never be harmless.        Commonwealth v. Payson, 723\n\nA.2d 695, 699\u2013700 (Pa. Super. 1999). Moreover,\n\n        the presumption must always be against the waiver of a\n        constitutional right. Nor can waiver be presumed where the\n        record is silent. The record must show, or there must be an\n        allegation and evidence which shows, that an accused was\n        offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the\n        offer. Anything less is not waiver.\n\nCommonwealth v. Monica, 597 A.2d 600, 603 (Pa. 1991).\n\n        Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 121 outlines additional\n\nrequirements for a valid waiver-of-counsel colloquy. It states, in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n        Rule 121. Waiver of Counsel\n\n        (A) Generally.\n\n        (1) The defendant may waive the right to be represented by\n        counsel.\n\n        (2) To ensure that the defendant's waiver of the right to counsel\n        is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, the judge or issuing\n        authority, at a minimum, shall elicit the following information\n        from the defendant:\n\n             (a) that the defendant understands that he ... has\n             the right to be represented by counsel, and the right\n             to have free counsel appointed if the defendant is\n             indigent;\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n           (b) that the defendant understands the nature of the\n           charges against the defendant and the elements of\n           each of those charges;\n\n           (c) that the defendant is aware of the permissible\n           range of sentences and/or fines for the offenses\n           charged;\n\n           (d) that the defendant understands that if he ...\n           waives the right to counsel, the defendant will still be\n           bound by all the normal rules of procedure and that\n           counsel would be familiar with these rules;\n\n           (e) that the defendant understands that there are\n           possible defenses to these charges that counsel\n           might be aware of, and if these defenses are not\n           raised at trial, they may be lost permanently; and\n\n           (f) that the defendant understands that, in addition\n           to defenses, the defendant has many rights that, if\n           not timely asserted, may be lost permanently; and\n           that if errors occur and are not timely objected to, or\n           otherwise timely raised by the defendant, these\n           errors may be lost permanently.\n\n                                    ***\n\n     (C) Proceedings Before a Judge. When the defendant seeks\n     to waive the right to counsel after the preliminary hearing, the\n     judge shall ascertain from the defendant, on the record, whether\n     this is a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of counsel.\n\nPa.R.Crim.P. 121(A)(1)-(2)(a)-(f), (C) (emphasis in original).        Finally, \u201ca\n\nwaiver colloquy must, of course, always contain a clear demonstration of the\n\ndefendant's ability to understand the questions posed to him during the\n\ncolloquy.\u201d Commonwealth v. McDonough, 812 A.2d 504, 507 n. 1 (Pa.\n\n2002).\n\n     With these requirements in mind, we now turn to Appellant\u2019s waiver of\n\ncounsel claims.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n             Adequacy of the November Waiver-of-Counsel Colloquy\n\n         During the November 13, 2014 waiver-of-counsel colloquy, Appellant\n\nanswered        questions   about   his   age,   educational   background,   and\n\ncomprehension skills.       N.T. Suppression, 11/13/14, at 4.     The trial court\n\nconfirmed that Appellant understood that he had a right to counsel, including\n\nthe right to be appointed counsel free of charge in the event he could not\n\nafford an attorney. Id. The trial court confirmed that Appellant understood\n\nthe nature of the charges against him, going over both of the charges then\n\npending as well as the elements of each offense.               Id. at 4-5, 9-11.\n\nAppellant acknowledged that he understood the maximum possible penalty\n\nfor each of the offenses charged.            Id. at 5.    Appellant indicated he\n\nunderstood he would be held to the same procedural and evidentiary rules\n\nas an attorney, and that an attorney would \u201cbe more familiar\u201d with those\n\nrules.    Id.    In addition, Appellant acknowledged he might have \u201cpossible\n\ndefenses that an attorney may be aware of that if not raised at trial [could\n\nbe lost] permanently.\u201d       Id. at 6.    Finally, Appellant stated he understood\n\nthat he had many rights that he would have to assert in a timely manner or\n\navoid losing permanently, including the right to appeal errors at trial. Id.\n\n         In spite of this extensive inquiry, Appellant now argues that the\n\nwaiver-of-counsel colloquies conducted in the trial court did not comply with\n\nthe minimum standards set forth in Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(A)(2) and that\n\ntherefore Appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel was not knowing, voluntary and\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nintelligent.    In    particular,   the    Appellant    argues     that   Pa.R.Crim.P.\n\n121(A)(2)(c), which requires the trial court to advise potential pro se\n\ndefendants of the \u201cpermissible range of sentences,\u201d also required the trial\n\ncourt to advise Appellant of the sentencing guidelines applicable to his case.\n\n      Addressing Appellant\u2019s claim requires us to interpret the meaning of\n\nRule 121. The interpretation of procedural rules is a question of law, so our\n\nstandard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary.\n\nCommonwealth v. Dowling, 959 A.2d 910, 913 (Pa. 2008).\n\n      The rules for interpreting a Rule of Criminal Procedure in this Court are\n\nwell established:\n\n      When we interpret our Rules of Criminal Procedure, we employ\n      the same principles employed in the interpretation of statutes.\n      Pa.R.Crim.P. 101(C); Commonwealth v. Cooper, 611 Pa. 437,\n      27 A.3d 994, 1003 (2011). The object of interpretation of the\n      criminal rules \u201cis to ascertain and effectuate the intention\u201d of our\n      Supreme Court, as the rule-issuing body. \u201cEvery [rule] shall be\n      construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1\n      Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cWhen the words of a [rule] are clear and\n      free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded\n      under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\n\nCommonwealth v. Noel, 53 A.3d 848, 855 (Pa. Super. 2012).\n\n      As the language of Pa.R.Crim.P. 121 is \u201cclear and free from all\n\nambiguity,     we    need   not   delve    further   into   the   applicable   rules   of\n\nconstruction.\u201d Id. at 855-56.\n\n      Rule 121, by its plain language, requires the trial court to determine\n\n\u201cthat the defendant is aware of the permissible range of sentences and/or\n\nfines for the offenses charged[.]\u201d           Pa.R.Crim.P. 121(A)(2)(c) (emphasis\n\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nadded). The plain language of Rule 121 does not mention that the trial court\n\nmust advise the defendant of the applicable sentencing guidelines.         Our\n\nSupreme Court is aware of the existence of sentencing guidelines, and if it\n\nwished to include the sentencing guidelines in the requirements under Rule\n\n121, it was free to do so. The Supreme Court did not.\n\n      We, thus, conclude that under the plain language of Rule 121, the trial\n\ncourt was not required to advise Appellant of the applicable sentencing\n\nguidelines prior to finding that Appellant had knowingly, voluntarily and\n\nintelligently waived his right to counsel. Therefore, Appellant is not entitled\n\nto relief on this claim.\n\n                     Duration of a Valid Waiver of Counsel\n\n      Appellant next argues that the Motion in Limine was a \u201ccritical stage,\u201d\n\nand therefore the lower court erred in hearing Appellant\u2019s Motion without\n\nfirst conducting a waiver-of-counsel colloquy.    Even assuming, arguendo,\n\nthat the Motion in Limine was a \u201ccritical stage,\u201d we have already held,\n\nsupra, that the trial court previously elicited a knowing, intelligent and\n\nvoluntary waiver of counsel from Appellant at the November 13, 2014\n\nhearing on the Motion to Suppress.       Accordingly, the relevant inquiry is\n\nwhether, and under what circumstances, the trial court has a duty to repeat\n\nthe waiver-of-counsel colloquy.\n\n      After a thorough review of the case law in this Commonwealth, we\n\nconclude this is a case of first impression.        Although our Opinion in\n\n\n\n                                    - 11 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nCommonwealth v. Baker, 464 A.2d 496 (Pa. Super. 1983), refers in dicta\n\nto the need for a thorough waiver-of-counsel colloquy \u201cat every critical stage\n\nof a criminal proceeding,\u201d this Court in Baker expressly declined to decide\n\nthe question of whether a waiver-of-counsel colloquy must be repeated at\n\nevery critical stage of the prosecution.2 Baker, 464 A.2d at 500. Although\n\nthe appellant in Baker raised the issue of whether the trial court was\n\nrequired to re-colloquy the appellant prior to sentencing, this Court found\n\nthe initial waiver colloquy constitutionally inadequate, and granted relief\n\nwithout addressing the issue of re-colloquy.\n\n      Although our research yielded no controlling case law in Pennsylvania\n\non the issue of the need to repeat the colloquy, our survey of our sister\n\nstates and federal circuit courts shows that every jurisdiction but one has\n\nheld that a valid waiver of counsel is presumed to remain effective\n\nthroughout any subsequent trial proceedings absent either a revocation by\n\nthe defendant or a substantial change in circumstances.3\n\n\n2\n  Moreover, none of the cases relied upon by this Court in Phillips, supra or\nBaker holds that a waiver-of-counsel colloquy must be repeated at every\ncritical stage of the prosecution. Instead, they highlight the fact that the\nquestion of waiver may arise for the first time at various stages, and that\nwhen it arises, if ever, the court must conduct a thorough waiver-of-counsel\ncolloquy. See Phillips, 93 A.3d at 854; Baker, 464 A.2d at 499.\n3\n  Importantly, the only jurisdiction to address the issue and hold otherwise\ndid so on the basis of a state statute that explicitly requires re-colloquy at\neach subsequent stage, and not on constitutional right-to-counsel grounds.\nSee Meuhleman v. State, 3 So.3d 1149, 1156 (Fla. 2009) (relying on Fla.\nR.Crim. P. 3.111(d)(5) (2003)).\n\n\n\n                                    - 12 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n      This \u201congoing waiver\u201d rule was first adopted by the Eighth Circuit in\n\nDavis v. United States, 226 F.2d 834, 840 (8th Cir. 1955) (finding the trial\n\njudge was \u201centirely justified in taking [the appellant\u2019s] prior refusal of\n\ncounsel as \u2018definite\u2019\u201d and still valid at a later proceeding, and reasoning that,\n\nabsent some change in circumstance, it would be \u201cmere ceremony\u201d and\n\n\u201cneither good law nor good sense\u201d to require the trial court to re-colloquy a\n\ndefendant at each subsequent proceeding).         Since Davis, every federal\n\nCircuit Court that has considered the issue has adopted some version of the\n\nongoing waiver rule announced in Davis.         See, e.g., United States v.\n\nUnger, 915 F.2d 759, 762 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that, in the absence of\n\nintervening events, a defendant's earlier waiver was still in force at the\n\nsentencing hearing); United States v. McBride, 362 F.3d 360, 367 (6th\n\nCir. 2004) (adopting \u201cthe rule set forth above by our sister circuits that a\n\ndefendant's waiver of counsel at trial carries over to subsequent proceedings\n\nabsent a substantial change in circumstances\u201d); United States v. Fazzini,\n\n871 F.2d 635, 643 (7th Cir. 1989) (holding that \u201c[o]nce the defendant has\n\nknowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, only a substantial\n\nchange in circumstances will require the district court to inquire whether the\n\ndefendant wishes to revoke his earlier waiver.\u201d); Panagos v. United\n\nStates, 324 F.2d 764, 765 (10th Cir. 1963) (denying motion to vacate\n\nsentence where the record contained \u201cno facts or circumstances which would\n\nprevent the initial waiver of the right to counsel, knowingly and intelligently\n\n\n\n                                     - 13 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nmade, from extending to and being fully effective at the time of\n\nsentencing\u201d).\n\n      The Ninth Circuit has pointed out that certain acts by the defendant\n\nmay trigger the need for a re-colloquy. In Arnold v. United States, 414\n\nF.2d 1056, (9th Cir. 1968), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that,\n\nalthough the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies at each critical stage\n\nof the prosecution, \u201cit does not follow that once the assistance of counsel in\n\ncourt has been competently waived, a new waiver must be obtained at every\n\nsubsequent court appearance by the defendant.\u201d       Id. at 1059. The Court\n\nthen considered whether the defendant may have triggered the need for a\n\nre-colloquy by expressly requesting the appointment of counsel or indicating\n\nin the initial waiver that he wanted to limit that waiver to a particular stage\n\nof the proceedings.    Id.   The Ninth Circuit found the defendant had not\n\ntriggered the need for a new colloquy, and therefore his valid waiver of\n\ncounsel prior to pleading guilty remained valid at sentencing and at re-\n\nsentencing some six months later. Id. at 1057.\n\n      Similar to the Federal Courts, nearly every state Supreme Court to\n\nconsider the issue has adopted the ongoing waiver rule. See, e.g., State v.\n\nMathis, 159 N.W.2d 729, 732 (Wis. 1968) (holding that a valid waiver\n\n\u201ccontinues through the proceedings until, by some act of the defendant, it is\n\nwithdrawn or the presumption of continuance interrupted\u201d); State v. Harig,\n\n218 N.W.2d 884, 890-91 (Neb. 1974), reaffirmed, State v. Tiff, 260 N.W.2d\n\n\n\n                                    - 14 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n296, 303 (Neb. 1977) (adopting the reasoning of the Circuit Courts in Davis\n\nand Panagos, supra); State v. Steed, 506 P.2d 1031, 1033 (Ariz. 1977)\n\n(holding that \u201c[a] defendant's election, once properly made, continues\n\nthroughout the trial and sentencing\u201d); State v. Carpenter, 390 So.2d 1296,\n\n1299 (La. 1980) (adopting the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit in Arnold,\n\nsupra); People v. Baker, 440 N.E.2d 856, 860-61 (Ill. 1982) (\u201cIn the\n\nabsence of some circumstances indicating that the waiver is limited, or other\n\nfacts which would give the trial court reason to conduct a further inquiry, we\n\nhold . . . that a competent waiver of counsel at arraignment by a defendant\n\nwho is advised that he has a constitutional right to counsel at all stages of\n\nthe proceedings is operative at the time of sentencing.\u201d); Lay v. State, 179\n\nP.3d 615, 620 (Okla. 2008) (finding defendant in a capital murder trial\n\nproperly waived his right to counsel during the guilt phase, and that this\n\nwaiver remained valid throughout the trial and sentencing phases),\n\nabrogated on other grounds by Harmon v. State, 248 P.3d 918 (Okla.\n\n2011).\n\n      Consistent with the weight of authority, we now hold that once a\n\ndefendant has made a competent waiver of counsel, that waiver remains in\n\neffect through all subsequent proceedings in that case absent a substantial\n\nchange in circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 15 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\n      Having adopted this rule, we now consider whether some substantial\n\nchange is present here.4     There is nothing in the record to suggest any\n\nchange in circumstances beyond the passage of a few months\u2019 time.\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence that suggests Appellant intended to limit his\n\nwaiver of counsel to the suppression hearing, or that Appellant requested\n\nthe re-appointment of counsel. Absent any of these triggers, the trial court\n\nwas not required to colloquy Appellant again prior to hearing Appellant\u2019s\n\nMotion in Limine on March 11, 2015. Therefore, Appellant is not entitled to\n\nrelief on this claim.\n\n             Admissibility of Out-of-Court Statements Claims\n\n      Appellant    next   challenges    the     admission   of   two   out-of-court\n\nstatements made by Matthews to 911 and to the responding police officers.\n\nAppellant\u2019s challenge to the admission of the statements includes two\n\ndistinct parts.5 First, Appellant argues that the out-of-court statements were\n\ninadmissible evidence of prior bad acts. Second, Appellant argues the out-\n\nof-court statements were irrelevant. We address and deny each argument\n\nin turn.\n\n      The out-of-court statements at issue were those of Matthews, who was\n\nallegedly beaten by Appellant with the gun and who initially summoned\n\n4\n  We expressly decline to define all the facts under which we would find a\nsubstantial change in circumstances.\n5\n  Appellant\u2019s Brief expressly abandons any hearsay objection raised at trial\nor in his Rule 1925(b) Statement. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 30.\n\n\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\npolice to the scene. She did not testify at trial. Instead, the Commonwealth\n\nbrought in two different out-of-court statements made by Matthews through\n\nother witnesses.\n\n      First, the Commonwealth played a 911 call in which Matthews asked\n\nfor help and told the dispatcher \u201che is trying to kill me.\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/12/15,\n\nat 52-53.     Appellant objected to the introduction of this evidence as\n\nirrelevant and unfairly prejudicial in the pre-trial Motion in Limine discussed\n\nabove.\n\n      Second, one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses testified to statements\n\nMatthews made to the responding officers. N.T. Trial, 3/12/15, at 69-71. In\n\nher statements on scene, Matthews told officers that Appellant had struck\n\nher about her face and abdomen with his fists and with a gun. Id. When\n\nasked about the gun, Matthews directed officers to the firearm recovered\n\nfrom under the bed.     Id.   Appellant made two hearsay objections to this\n\ntestimony, which the trial court overruled on the grounds that the\n\nstatements were admissible excited utterances. Id.\n\n      In the argument portion of Appellant\u2019s Brief to this Court, he avers\n\nthat the 911 call and statements made at the scene of Appellant\u2019s arrest\n\nwere inadmissible evidence of prior bad acts under Pa.R.E. 404(b). We find\n\nAppellant waived this argument as to both statements.\n\n      Our Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure and our case law set\n\nforth the well-established requirements for preserving a claim for appellate\n\n\n\n                                     - 17 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nreview.    \u201cIssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be\n\nraised for the first time on appeal.\u201d     Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).    This requirement\n\nbars an appellant from raising \u201ca new and different theory of relief\u201d for the\n\nfirst time on appeal. Commonwealth v. York, 465 A.2d 1028, 1032 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 1983).\n\n      Similarly, our Supreme Court has made it clear that \u201c[a]ny issues not\n\nraised    in   a   [Rule]   1925(b)   statement   will   be   deemed   waived.\u201d\n\nCommonwealth v. Castillo, 888 A.2d 775, 780 (Pa. 2005) (citation and\n\nquotation omitted).         See also Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(vii) (\u201cIssues not\n\nincluded in the Statement . . . are waived.\u201d). Moreover, the issues raised\n\nmust be identified with sufficient particularity; a Rule 1925(b) statement\n\n\u201cwhich is too vague to allow the court to identify the issues raised on appeal\n\nis the functional equivalent of no [Rule 1925(b)] Statement at all.\u201d\n\nLineberger v. Wyeth, 894 A.2d 141, 148 (Pa. Super. 2006).\n\n      In the instant case, Appellant\u2019s arguments to the trial court were\n\nlimited to objections on the basis of relevance and hearsay.        At no point\n\nbefore, during, or after trial did Appellant object on the ground that the\n\nevidence was inadmissible as prior bad acts. Nor did Appellant raise this bad\n\nacts argument in his Rule 1925(b) Statement, which again was limited to\n\nalleging error on the grounds the testimony was irrelevant and/or hearsay.\n\nBecause Appellant is improperly attempting to raise a new theory of relief for\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 18 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nthe first time on appeal, we conclude Appellant waived this prior acts claim.\n\nSee Pa.R.A.P. 302(a); York, supra.\n\n      Appellant\u2019s Statement of Questions Involved also avers that the out-\n\nof-court statements were not relevant on remand given that the initial jury\n\nacquitted Appellant of Simple Assault. The argument section of Appellant\u2019s\n\ncounseled Brief to this Court, however, lacks any discussion of this relevance\n\nclaim.   Instead, the argument section of Appellant\u2019s Brief sets forth, in\n\nsubstance, only a prior bad acts argument.     Accordingly, Appellant waived\n\nthis relevance claim.\n\n      This Court will address only those issues properly presented and\n\ndeveloped in an appellant\u2019s brief as required by our Rules of Appellate\n\nProcedure, Pa.R.A.P. 2101-2119. \u201cAppellate arguments which fail to adhere\n\nto these rules may be considered waived, and arguments which are not\n\nappropriately developed are waived.\u201d Coulter, supra at 1088 (citation and\n\nquotation omitted). Thus, issues raised in a Brief\u2019s Statement of Questions\n\nInvolved but not developed in the Brief\u2019s argument section will be deemed\n\nwaived. Harkins v. Calumet Realty Co., 614 A.2d 699, 703 (Pa. Super.\n\n1992).\n\n      Appellant\u2019s Brief does not refer to Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 401,\n\ndefining the test for whether evidence is relevant, or to Rule 402, which\n\ngoverns the admissibility of relevant evidence generally. Nor does Appellant\n\ncite to any cases which interpret or apply our relevance standards outside of\n\n\n\n                                    - 19 -\n\fJ.S22027/16\n\n\nthose cases that consider whether evidence of prior bad acts may be\n\nexcluded as unfairly prejudicial.\n\n      In fact, Appellant expressly concedes that the out-of-court statements\n\nhad at least \u201cminimal relevance,\u201d but argues that the evidence should have\n\nbeen excluded as improper evidence of a prior bad act under Rule 404(b).\n\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 32. As discussed supra, Appellant failed to preserve any\n\nprior bad acts claim.     He cannot now resurrect that claim on appeal by\n\ncalling it something else.   Nor can he preserve a relevance argument in a\n\nbrief that only discusses the evidence\u2019s admissibility as a prior bad act. See\n\nHarkings, 614 A.2d at 703.          Therefore, we find Appellant waived this\n\nrelevance claim.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      Having found Appellant waived two of his claims and is not entitled to\n\nrelief on the merits of his remaining claims, we affirm the trial court\u2019s\n\nJudgment of Sentence.\n\n      Judgment of Sentence affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
