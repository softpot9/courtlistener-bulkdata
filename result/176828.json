William Jacob Watkins, Jr.,\nOFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Greenville, South\nCarolina, for Appellee.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n             Sandra G. Robinson pled guilty to conspiracy against\n\nthe United States, fraud and related activity in connection with\n\nidentification documents, and aggravated identity theft based on\n\nher activities in making counterfeit checks using identification\n\ninformation       gathered       from    stolen       mail.       The     district           court\n\nsentenced     her    to    24    months     imprisonment          for     the         first   two\n\noffenses, and a consecutive 24 months on the aggravated identity\n\ntheft      conviction.           Robinson\u2019s        counsel        filed       a       brief    in\n\naccordance      with      Anders    v.    California,           386    U.S.   738       (1967),\n\nstating that, in counsel\u2019s view, there are no meritorious issues\n\nfor   appeal,      but    questioning       whether        Robinson\u2019s         sentence        was\n\nimproperly enhanced in relation to the extent of her involvement\n\nin the conspiracy, whether the district court\u2019s consideration of\n\nthe   18    U.S.C.     \u00a7 3553(a)        (2006)     factors       was    sufficient,            and\n\nwhether      Robinson\u2019s         sentence      is      reasonable.                 Finding      no\n\nreversible error, we affirm.\n\n             On     appeal,      Robinson     asserts         that     her    sentence         is\n\nprocedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to\n\nadequately analyze the statutory sentencing factors set forth in\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and explain the reasons for selecting the\n\nforty-eight-month total sentence.                  When      determining          a   sentence,\n\nthe   district       court      must     calculate        the    appropriate           advisory\n\nguidelines        range    and     consider      it     in      conjunction           with    the\n\n                                             2\n\f\u00a7 3553(a) factors.         Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49-50\n\n(2007).        Additionally, the district court \u201cmust place on the\n\nrecord    an    individualized       assessment       based   on     the    particular\n\nfacts of the case before it.\u201d             United States v. Carter, 564 F.3d\n\n325, 330 (4th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAppellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence,\n\n\u201cwhether       inside,   just   outside,        or   significantly         outside   the\n\n[g]uidelines range,\u201d is for abuse of discretion.                           Id. at 41.\n\nSentences within the applicable guidelines range are presumed by\n\nthe appellate court to be reasonable.                   United States v. Pauley,\n\n511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir. 2007).\n\n               The district court followed the necessary procedural\n\nsteps     in     sentencing     Robinson,        appropriately        treating       the\n\nsentencing       guidelines     as   advisory,       properly       calculating      and\n\nconsidering the applicable guidelines range, and weighing the\n\nrelevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors.               Additionally, the district court\n\nconsidered and adopted the findings in the presentence report,\n\nconsidered the statements and arguments asserted by counsel on\n\nRobinson\u2019s      behalf,   including       her    lack    of   any    prior    criminal\n\nhistory, and allowed Robinson\u2019s daughter to address the court\n\nand plea for leniency for her mother.                 The court noted, however,\n\nthat,     shortly    after      joining       the    conspiracy,      Robinson       was\n\narrested and, upon release, she resumed her criminal activities.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f             We are satisfied from our review of the record \u201c\u2018that\n\n[the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and\n\nhas    a     reasoned      basis         for       exercising      [its]      own    legal\n\ndecisionmaking authority.\u2019\u201d                United States v.

We\n\nfind    no     abuse      of     discretion           in     the   district         court\u2019s\n\ndetermination of Robinson\u2019s sentence, and therefore affirm.\n\n             In accordance with Anders, we have reviewed the entire\n\nrecord in this case and have found no meritorious issues for\n\nappeal.      This court requires that counsel inform Robinson, in\n\nwriting,     of    the   right      to   petition      the    Supreme      Court    of   the\n\nUnited States for further review.                     If Robinson requests that a\n\npetition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition\n\nwould be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for\n\nleave to withdraw from representation.                        Counsel\u2019s motion must\n\nstate that a copy thereof was served on Robinson.                             We dispense\n\nwith oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are\n\nadequately        presented    in    the       materials     before     the    court     and\n\nargument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                                   AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                            UNPUBLISHED\n\n                  UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                      FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                            No. 09-5227\n\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                Plaintiff \u2013 Appellee,\n\n          v.\n\nSANDRA G.

We\n\nfind    no     abuse      of     discretion           in     the   district         court\u2019s\n\ndetermination of Robinson\u2019s sentence, and therefore affirm.\n\n             In accordance with Anders, we have reviewed the entire\n\nrecord in this case and have found no meritorious issues for\n\nappeal.      This court requires that counsel inform Robinson, in\n\nwriting,     of    the   right      to   petition      the    Supreme      Court    of   the\n\nUnited States for further review.                     If Robinson requests that a\n\npetition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition\n\nwould be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for\n\nleave to withdraw from representation.                        Counsel\u2019s motion must\n\nstate that a copy thereof was served on Robinson.                             We dispense\n\nwith oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are\n\nadequately        presented    in    the       materials     before     the    court     and\n\nargument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n                                                                                   AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
