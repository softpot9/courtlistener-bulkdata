Vigil, District Judge\n\nGary K. King, Attorney General\nRebecca A. Parish, Assistant Attorney General\nSanta Fe, NM\n\nfor Appellee\n\nLuebben Johnson & Barnhouse LLP\nRandolph H. Barnhouse\nKelli J. Keegan\nLos Ranchos de Albuquerque, NM\n\nfor Appellant\n\n                                         OPINION\n\nFRY, Judge.\n\n{1}     Defendant Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., a tobacco company, appeals\nthe district court\u2019s denial of its motion to set aside a default judgment entered against it in\nan action brought by the State to force Grand River to contribute money into New Mexico\u2019s\n\n                                              1\n\ftobacco escrow fund. On appeal, Grand River argues that the default judgment must be set\naside because (1) the State failed to comply with the rules governing the service of process\non foreign corporations; and (2) the district court did not have personal jurisdiction over\nGrand River when it entered the default judgment. Because we agree with Grand River that\nthe district court lacked personal jurisdiction, we conclude that the district court\u2019s default\njudgment is void and must be set aside.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n{2}      Grand River manufactures tobacco products, including Opal brand cigarettes. Grand\nRiver is incorporated in Canada, with its principal place of business in Ohsweken, Ontario,\nand operates exclusively on the Six Nation Indian Reserve. During the time material to this\nlitigation, Grand River was not registered to do business in New Mexico, did not have an\nagent for the service of process in New Mexico, and did not directly engage in business\nactivity in New Mexico.\n\n{3}     In early 2005, Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop in Deming, New Mexico allegedly sold\napproximately 19,540 Opal cigarettes. Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop purchased the cigarettes from\nwholesale distributor Snow Mountain Wholesale, located in Las Vegas, Nevada. According\nto the affidavit of Grand River\u2019s President, Grand River did not have any contact or a\ncontractual arrangement with either Snow Mountain Wholesale or Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop\nregarding the sale of the cigarettes in New Mexico.\n\n{4}     In 2007, the Attorney General filed suit against Grand River for failing to comply\nwith the Tobacco Escrow Fund Act, NMSA 1978, Sections 6-4-14 to -24 (2003, as amended\nthrough 2009). The Act requires some tobacco companies to contribute money into an\nescrow account according to the amount of individual cigarettes they have sold in the state.\nNMSA 1978, \u00a7 6-4-13(C) (2004). The Attorney General alleged that Grand River owed\napproximately $327.37 to the State for the 19,540 Opal cigarettes Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop sold\nin 2005.\n\n{5}     The Attorney General mailed Grand River a copy of the summons and complaint by\ncertified mail. See Rule 1-004(N) NMRA (service of process on foreign corporations).\nGrand River did not respond to the Attorney General\u2019s complaint. The Attorney General\nsubsequently sought and was granted a default judgment. Grand River then moved to set\naside the default judgment, arguing that the judgment was void because the Attorney General\nfailed to properly serve Grand River with process and because the district court lacked\npersonal jurisdiction. Rule 1-060(B)(4) NMRA (providing that the court may relieve a party\nfrom a final judgment on the grounds that the judgment is void). The district court denied\nGrand River\u2019s motion. Grand River appeals.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n{6}    Under Rule 1-060(B)(4), the district court is required to set aside a void judgment.\n\n                                              2\n\fNesbit v. City of Albuquerque, 1977-NMSC-017, \u00b6 12, 91 N.M. 455, 575 P.2d 1340. In this\ncase, Grand River argued that the default judgment was void because the district court lacked\npersonal jurisdiction. See Alvarez v. County of Bernalillo, 1993-NMCA-034, \u00b6 10, 115 N.M.\n328, 850 P.2d 1031 (noting that a judgment entered against a party over whom the court\nlacks personal jurisdiction is a void judgment). The parties stipulated below that New\nMexico does not have general personal jurisdiction over Grand River. See Sproul v. Rob &\nCharlies, Inc., 2013-NMCA-072, \u00b6 14, 304 P.3d 18 (\u201c[T]he flow of a manufacturer\u2019s goods\ninto the forum state alone does not create sufficient ties with that state to give it general\njurisdiction over the manufacturer.\u201d). We therefore limit our analysis to the determination\nof whether New Mexico can exercise specific personal jurisdiction under the facts in this\ncase. Because we conclude that New Mexico cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over\nGrand River in this case, we do not consider Grand River\u2019s additional argument that service\nof process was improper.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n{7}     Generally, we review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to set aside a default\njudgment for abuse of discretion. Rodriguez v. Conant, 1987-NMSC-040, \u00b6 20, 105 N.M.\n746, 737 P.2d 527. However, a district court has no discretion to refuse to set aside a void\njudgment under Rule 1-060(B)(4). Chavez v. County of Valencia, 1974-NMSC-035, \u00b6 16,\n86 N.M. 205, 521 P.2d 1154. \u201cThe determination of whether the district court has personal\njurisdiction [over a nonresident defendant] is a question of law that we review de novo.\u201d\nSublett v. Wallin, 2004-NMCA-089, \u00b6 11, 136 N.M. 102, 94 P.3d 845. We review \u201cthe\npleadings and affidavits . . . in the light most favorable to the party asserting jurisdiction.\u201d\n Santa Fe Technologies, Inc. v. Argus Networks, Inc., 2002-NMCA-030, \u00b6 12, 131 N.M. 772,\n42 P.3d 1221 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nSpecific Personal Jurisdiction and the Stream of Commerce Theory\n\n{8}      The State asserted that personal jurisdiction existed pursuant to New Mexico\u2019s long-\narm statute. NMSA 1978, \u00a7 38-1-16 (1971). Because we consider the long-arm statute \u201cas\nbeing coextensive with the requirements of due process,\u201d we no longer require a\ndetermination that the defendant committed one of the acts enumerated by the statute but\nrather \u201cundertake a single search for the outer limits of what due process permits.\u201d M.R. v.\nSereniCare Funeral Home, L.L.C., 2013-NMCA-022, \u00b6 8, 296 P.3d 492 (internal quotation\nmarks and citation omitted), cert. denied, 2013-NMCERT-001, 299 P.3d 862. \u201cDue process\nis satisfied only when a defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state so\nthat the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant will not violate traditional notions of fair\nplay and substantial justice.\u201d Sproul, 2013-NMCA-072, \u00b6 9 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). The \u201cminimum contacts\u201d required to establish jurisdiction depend on\n\u201cwhether the jurisdiction asserted is general (all-purpose) or specific (case-linked).\u201d Id. In\nthe context of specific personal jurisdiction, the \u201ccentral feature of minimum contacts . . . is\nthe requirement of purposeful availment.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16; see also F.D.I.C. v. Hiatt, 1994-NMSC-\n044, \u00b6 8, 117 N.M. 461, 872 P.2d 879 (\u201c[T]here [must] be some act by which the defendant\n\n                                                3\n\fpurposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum [s]tate,\nthus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted)). Specific personal jurisdiction is \u201cconfined to adjudication of [the] issues deriving\nfrom, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction\u201d and is \u201cdecided\non a case-by-case basis.\u201d Sproul, 2013-NMCA-072, \u00b6 17 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).\n\n{9}      In some instances the \u201cflow of a manufacturer\u2019s products into the forum state through\nthe stream of commerce\u201d constitutes purposeful availment and \u201cmay provide specific\njurisdiction over a nonresident corporation.\u201d Id. Under this \u201cstream of commerce\u201d theory,\n\u201cpersonal jurisdiction may exist over a nonresident defendant that \u2018delivers its products into\nthe stream of commerce with the expectation that they will be purchased by consumers in\nthe forum [s]tate.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 20 (alterations in original) (emphasis omitted) (quoting World-\nWide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 298 (1980)). Under our current\nframework, a showing that the manufacturer specifically directed its activities at the forum\nstate or had actual knowledge that its product would ultimately be sold in the forum state is\nnot required. Sproul, 2013-NMCA-072, \u00b6 32. But the \u201cmere foreseeability that a product\nmay make its way into our state either by the act of a consumer or through a random or\nisolated sale is not enough to confer jurisdiction.\u201d Id. \u00b6 25; World-Wide Volkswagen, 444\nU.S. at 295 (\u201c[F]oreseeability alone has never been a sufficient benchmark for personal\njurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\nInstead, there \u201cmust be some act purposefully directed at the forum state,\u201d Sproul, 2013-\nNMCA-072, \u00b6 25, even if that act \u201carise[s] from the efforts of the [defendant] to serve\ndirectly or indirectly, the market for its product in other [s]tates.\u201d SereniCare, 2013-NMCA-\n022, \u00b6 28 (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\nThe District Court Lacked Specific Personal Jurisdiction\n\n{10} We briefly set out the sum of the State\u2019s allegations and evidence in support of its\nassertion that New Mexico could exercise personal jurisdiction over Grand River. In its\ncomplaint, the State alleged that Grand River \u201chas contracted to either manufacture, sell, or\nprofit from the sale of cigarettes\u201d in New Mexico and has \u201cmaintain[ed] purposeful and\ncontinuous business interactions in this State by the ongoing sales of tobacco products.\u201d In\nits motion for default judgment, the State argued that the exercise of personal jurisdiction\nwas proper because \u201c[Grand River] has sold cigarettes to consumers in New Mexico . . . for\npecuniary gain either directly or through distributors, retailers, or similar intermediary or\nintermediaries.\u201d The State attached to its motion Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop\u2019s \u201cReporting Form\nfor Cigarette Sales of Non-Participating Manufacturer Brands\u201d filed with the New Mexico\nTaxation and Revenue Department showing that Opal brand cigarettes were sold in its store.\nTo the extent that these averments and the exhibit\u2014 when viewed in the light most favorable\nto jurisdiction\u2014allege that Grand River \u201cpurposefully established contact with New\nMexico,\u201d they could support a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction. Sproul, 2013-\nNMCA-072, \u00b6 16; Zavala v. El Paso Cnty. Hosp. Dist., 2007-NMCA-149, \u00b6 13, 143 N.M.\n36, 172 P.3d 173.\n\n                                              4\n\f{11} However, Grand River filed an affidavit by its president negating many of the State\u2019s\naverments. The affidavit stated that Grand River had never engaged in any business activity\nin New Mexico and that it never had any contractual relationship with either Snow Mountain\nWholesale or Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop. The president\u2019s affidavit also stated that Grand River,\nincluding its cigarette manufacturing, operates exclusively on the Six Nation Indian Reserve\nin Canada and that it has not sold cigarettes at any place other than the Six Nation Indian\nReserve.       Furthermore, the State\u2019s only documentary evidence\u2014the taxation\nform\u2014establishes only that Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop purchased the cigarettes from Snow\nMountain Wholesale but fails to establish any commercial relationship between Grand River\nand Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop or Snow Mountain Wholesale. The president\u2019s affidavit therefore\nnegates the State\u2019s only averments and evidence that Grand River contracted to manufacture,\nsell, or profit from the sale of cigarettes in New Mexico through the use of a nationwide\ndistribution chain. In the absence of such evidence, there is nothing to establish that Grand\nRiver placed its cigarettes into the national stream of commerce in expectation that the\ncigarettes would be purchased in New Mexico. See Sproul, 2013-NMCA-072, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 31. We\ntherefore conclude that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction and that the default\njudgment is void and should be set aside. See Hiatt, 1994-NMSC-044, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 15 (holding that\na default judgment was void and should be set aside where the district court lacked personal\njurisdiction over the defendant).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n{12} The default judgment of the district court is reversed and this matter is remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\n\n{13}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n\n                                              CYNTHIA A.

The affidavit stated that Grand River had never engaged in any business activity\nin New Mexico and that it never had any contractual relationship with either Snow Mountain\nWholesale or Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop. The president\u2019s affidavit also stated that Grand River,\nincluding its cigarette manufacturing, operates exclusively on the Six Nation Indian Reserve\nin Canada and that it has not sold cigarettes at any place other than the Six Nation Indian\nReserve.       Furthermore, the State\u2019s only documentary evidence\u2014the taxation\nform\u2014establishes only that Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop purchased the cigarettes from Snow\nMountain Wholesale but fails to establish any commercial relationship between Grand River\nand Grace\u2019s Smoke Shop or Snow Mountain Wholesale. The president\u2019s affidavit therefore\nnegates the State\u2019s only averments and evidence that Grand River contracted to manufacture,\nsell, or profit from the sale of cigarettes in New Mexico through the use of a nationwide\ndistribution chain. In the absence of such evidence, there is nothing to establish that Grand\nRiver placed its cigarettes into the national stream of commerce in expectation that the\ncigarettes would be purchased in New Mexico. See Sproul, 2013-NMCA-072, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 31. We\ntherefore conclude that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction and that the default\njudgment is void and should be set aside.
