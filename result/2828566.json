In exchange for the increase, Dr. Gutierrez allegedly\n\ngave kickbacks to Mr. Kupfer through Mr. Kupfer\u2019s consulting\n\ncompany. The government alleged that Dr. Gutierrez had disguised\n\nthe kickbacks as payments for Mr. Kupfer\u2019s work on a separate media\n\ncampaign involving voter awareness.\n\n      The government successfully prosecuted Mr. Kupfer in two\n\ntrials. In the first, the jury found Mr. Kupfer and his wife guilty of\n\ntax evasion. In the second, the jury found Mr. Kupfer guilty of\n\nstealing and participating in a conspiracy to steal federal government\n\nproperty with a co-defendant, Dr. Gutierrez. The district court\n\nentered a judgment of conviction for these crimes and sentenced\n\nMr. Kupfer to ten years in prison. Mr. Kupfer appeals the conviction\n\nand sentence on all counts.\n\n      On appeal, we affirm the conviction and reverse and remand to\n\nthe district court for resentencing.\n\nI.    Issues Involving the Conviction\n\n      We start with Mr. Kupfer\u2019s challenges to the conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f      A.    Tax Evasion Trial\n\n      Mr. Kupfer and his wife jointly filed federal income taxes from\n\n2004 to 2006, but failed to report over $790,000 in gross income. The\n\ngovernment charged Mr. Kupfer with three counts of tax evasion and\n\naiding and abetting, one count for each year. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201;\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Mr. Kupfer admitted that he had failed to report a\n\nsubstantial amount of gross income, but denied that his under-\n\nreporting was willful. The jury disagreed and found Mr. Kupfer\n\nguilty on each count. On appeal, he challenges the adequacy of the\n\njury instructions and the district court\u2019s response to an allegation of\n\njury misconduct. 1 On both issues, we conclude that the district court\n\nacted within its discretion.\n\n      1.    Jury Instructions\n\n      The district court instructed the jury that it could find guilt\n\nonly if Mr. Kupfer\u2019s under-reporting of income had been willful.\n\nAccording to Mr. Kupfer, the court should have gone further,\n\ninstructing the jury that the under-reporting would not have been\n\nconsidered \u201cwillful\u201d if it had been merely negligent, inadvertent,\n\naccidental, mistaken, or reckless. We rejected this contention in\n\n1\n      Ms. Elizabeth Kupfer filed her own appeal in the tax evasion\ncase, and Mr. Kupfer joins in her arguments. See Fed. R. App. P.\n28(i). We more fully addressed the issues on the tax counts in United\nStates v. Kupfer (Elizabeth), No. 13-2138, __ F.3d __, 2015 WL\n4081108, at *1-3 (10th Cir. July 7, 2015).\n                                   -3-\n\fdeciding Ms. Kupfer\u2019s appeal. United States v. Kupfer (Elizabeth),\n\nNo. 13-2138, __ F.3d __, 2015 WL 4081108, at *1\u20133 (10th Cir. July 7,\n\n2015). Based on our opinion in that appeal, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court acted within its discretion in declining to include Mr.\n\nKupfer\u2019s proposed language.\n\n      2.    Juror Misconduct\n\n      After the trial ended, Ms. Kupfer submitted an affidavit from a\n\njuror stating that a fellow juror had commented about other charges\n\nduring jury deliberations. Based on this affidavit, Mr. Kupfer\n\nrequested a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct. The district\n\ncourt declined to conduct a hearing or grant a mistrial. We conclude\n\nthat these rulings fell within the district court\u2019s discretion because\n\nthe court could reasonably determine on the record it had that (1) a\n\nhearing was unnecessary and (2) the improper remarks were\n\nharmless.\n\n      When a defendant presents credible evidence of prejudicial\n\ninformation during jury deliberations, a presumption of prejudice\n\narises and the trial court must investigate. United States v. Davis, 60\n\nF.3d 1479, 1484\u201385 (10th Cir. 1995). To carry out that duty, trial\n\ncourts must ordinarily hold a hearing; but in rare exceptions, the\n\ncourt need not hold a hearing if it would not be useful. United States\n\nv. McVeigh, 153 F.3d 1166, 1186 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n                                   -4-\n\f      As explained in our opinion addressing Ms. Kupfer\u2019s appeal,\n\nthe district court acted within its discretion in declining to conduct a\n\nhearing and in denying the motion for a mistrial. United States v.\n\nKupfer (Elizabeth), No. 13-2138, __ F.3d __, 2015 WL 4081108, at\n\n*3\u20136 (10th Cir. July 7, 2015).\n\n      B.    Conspiracy Trial\n\n      The conspiracy trial involved allegations of overpayment to\n\nMr. Kupfer, ostensibly based on his subcontract to help on a media\n\ncampaign. This media campaign grew out of a federal grant to the\n\nState of New Mexico to increase voter awareness. With this grant,\n\nthe State paid millions to a consultant (Dr. Gutierrez), who in turn\n\npaid over $740,000 to Mr. Kupfer.\n\n      Dr. Gutierrez also had two other State contracts. One involved\n\nan anti-smoking campaign; the other involved an elder-abuse\n\ncampaign.\n\n      No misconduct is alleged with the elder-abuse campaign. But\n\nthe government argued at trial that Mr. Kupfer had influenced the\n\nState to amend the contract for the anti-smoking campaign, allowing\n\nDr. Gutierrez to obtain more than $950,000 in extra compensation.\n\n      According to the government, Mr. Kupfer earned only a small\n\nfraction of the $950,000+. The remainder, according to the\n\ngovernment, was a kickback to Mr. Kupfer for his role in getting\n\n                                   -5-\n\fDr. Gutierrez the increased compensation on his anti-smoking\n\ncontract.\n\n      Invoking this theory, the government charged Mr. Kupfer with\n\none count of conspiracy and three counts of stealing federal money or\n\nassisting another in stealing federal money. The jury found Mr.\n\nKupfer guilty on all counts, and he argues that the district court erred\n\nby admitting evidence of the anti-smoking and elder-abuse contracts.\n\n      1.    Evidence Involving the Anti-Smoking Contract\n\n      At trial, the government presented evidence of Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nrole in a contract between the New Mexico Attorney General\u2019s Office\n\nand Dr. Gutierrez. This contract called for Dr. Gutierrez to produce\n\ncommercials on smoking prevention and cessation.\n\n      Mr. Kupfer moved to preclude evidence of this contract,\n\narguing that (1) the evidence was not relevant and (2) it constituted\n\ninadmissible evidence of uncharged misconduct under Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 404(b). The court overruled the objection, holding that\n\n(1) the evidence was probative as intrinsic evidence and (2) the\n\nprobative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\funfair prejudice. 2 We conclude that the district court acted within its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the evidence.\n\n      a.    Intrinsic Evidence\n\n      Mr. Kupfer challenges the characterization of the anti-smoking\n\ncontract as intrinsic evidence. We reject that challenge. The district\n\ncourt acted within its discretion in concluding that the evidence was\n\ninextricably intertwined with the charged conduct.\n\n      When we apply Rule 404(b), we distinguish between evidence\n\nthat is extrinsic or intrinsic to the charged crime. United States v.\n\nPace, 981 F.2d 1123, 1135 (10th Cir. 1992), abrogated on other\n\ngrounds as recognized in United States v. Bell, 154 F.3d 1205, 1209\u2013\n\n10 (10th Cir. 1998). Evidence of other acts may be inadmissible\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), but this rule does not cover\n\nevidence that is considered \u201cintrinsic.\u201d United States v. Irving, 665\n\nF.3d 1184, 1212 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n      Evidence is considered\n\n      \uf0b7     \u201cintrinsic\u201d when it is \u201cdirectly connected to the factual\n            circumstances of the crime and provides contextual or\n            background information to the jury,\u201d and\n\n      \uf0b7     \u201cextrinsic\u201d when it \u201cis extraneous and is not intimately\n            connected or blended with the factual circumstances of\n            the charged offense.\u201d\n\n2\n      In the alterative, the district court held that the evidence would\nbe admissible as extrinsic evidence. We need not address the\nalternative rationale.\n                                   -7-\n\fUnited States v. Parker, 553 F.3d 1309, 1314 (10th Cir. 2009)\n\n(quoting Thomas M. DiBiagio, Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evidence in\n\nFederal Criminal Trials: Is the Admission of Collateral Other-\n\nCrimes Evidence Disconnected to the Fundamental Right to a Fair\n\nTrial, 47 Syracuse L. Rev. 1229, 1231 (1997)).\n\n     We regard evidence as intrinsic when it\n\n     \uf0b7     was \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the charged conduct, 3\n\n     \uf0b7     occurred within the same time frame as the activity in the\n           conspiracy being charged, 4\n\n     \uf0b7     was a necessary preliminary to the charged conspiracy, 5\n\n     \uf0b7     provided direct proof of the defendant\u2019s involvement with\n           the charged crimes, 6\n\n     \uf0b7     was \u201centirely germane background information, . . .\n           \u2018directly connected to the factual circumstances of the\n           crime,\u2019\u201d 7 or\n\n\n\n3\n      United States v. Lambert, 995 F.2d 1006, 1007 (10th Cir. 1993)\n(quoting United States v. Williams, 900 F.2d 823, 825 (5th Cir.\n1990)).\n4\n     See United States v. Parker, 553 F.3d 1309, 1315 (10th Cir.\n2009) (\u201cThe three transactions within the charged conspiracy time-\nframe are intrinsic to the crime and substantiate the criminal\nconspiracy.\u201d).\n5\n     Lambert, 995 F.2d at 1007.\n6\n     Parker, 553 F.3d at 1314\u201315.\n7\n     United States v. Irving, 665 F.3d 1184, 1212\u201313 (10th Cir.\n2011) (quoting Parker, 553 F.3d at 1314).\n                                  -8-\n\f     \uf0b7     was necessary to provide the jury with background and\n           context of the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to\n           his accomplice. 8\nThe district court could reasonably conclude that evidence of the\n\nanti-smoking contract had satisfied these criteria: Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s\n\npayments to Mr. Kupfer and the anti-smoking contract amendments\n\noccurred together within a short time-period and tended to show the\n\nconspiracy being charged and Mr. Kupfer\u2019s involvement. See United\n\nStates v. Parker, 553 F.3d 1309, 1315 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n     The district court regarded the anti-smoking contract as\n\nintrinsic because it (1) was intertwined with payments Dr. Gutierrez\n\nhad made to Mr. Kupfer and (2) showed Elizabeth Kupfer\u2019s\n\ninvolvement in issuing payments. R., vol. VIII, at 3081\u201382. The\n\ndistrict court based its ruling on the government\u2019s theory of the\n\nintertwined relationship between the federal grant and the anti-\n\nsmoking contract amendments, which is reflected by the timing of the\n\npayments to Mr. Kupfer.\n\n     Within five months of receiving a $250,000 increase in the\n\nanti-smoking contract, Dr. Gutierrez paid $140,000 to Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nconsulting company even though it had not yet begun work on the\n\nproject. Id. at 1866\u201367, 2620\u201321. The court could wonder why Dr.\n\n\n8\n     United States v. Hall, 508 F.

See id. at 1808 (discussing the facts that \u201cthe contract\n\nbecame effective 9-9-04, and that invoice [for $2 million] came in\n\nthe day after\u201d).\n\n      Then, within thirteen months of the largest price increase under\n\nthe anti-smoking contract ($350,000), Dr. Gutierrez made three more\n\nmonthly payments (totaling $200,000) to Mr. Kupfer\u2019s consulting\n\ncompany.\n\n      Based on this timing, the jury could infer a connection between\n\n(1) Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s price increases under the anti-smoking contract\n\nand (2) his payments to Mr. Kupfer under the voter-awareness\n\ncontract.\n\n      Mr. Kupfer argues that the voter-awareness and anti-smoking\n\ncontracts were distinct because the contracts involved different\n\nagencies, only one of the contracts involved federal funds, and the\n\nanti-smoking contract preceded the voter-awareness contract by four\n\nyears. It is true that the contracts were distinct. But the government\n\ntheorized that Dr. Gutierrez had used money from the voter-\n\nawareness contract to pay Mr. Kupfer for increasing the payments\n\nunder the anti-smoking contract. Under this theory, both contracts\n\n(the voter-awareness and the anti-smoking contracts) were integral to\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthe scheme. The differences between the contracts did not invalidate\n\nthe government\u2019s theory.\n\n     According to Mr. Kupfer, the government changed its theory at\n\ntrial, characterizing the payments to Mr. Kupfer as kickbacks on the\n\nvoter-awareness contract (rather than for the price increases on the\n\nanti-smoking contract). This argument reflects Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nconfusion over the government\u2019s theory.\n\n     The government never accused Mr. Kupfer of doing something\n\nillegal to get Dr. Gutierrez the voter-awareness contract; the\n\ngovernment\u2019s theory\u2015before, during, and after the trial\u2015was that\n\nMr. Kupfer and his wife had worked to land Dr. Gutierrez over\n\n$950,000 in additional payments under the anti-smoking contract.\n\n     Under the government\u2019s theory, Dr. Gutierrez had to pay\n\nMr. Kupfer to secure the extra payments. Mr. Kupfer had no\n\nresponsibilities under the anti-smoking contract, but he had a\n\nsubcontract to help Dr. Gutierrez with the voter-awareness contract.\n\nThat subcontract involved Mr. Kupfer\u2019s production-related work on a\n\nshort training video. For that work, Dr. Gutierrez paid Mr. Kupfer\n\nover $740,000. The government attributed those payments to\n\nkickbacks for the anti-smoking contract\u2019s price increases. The\n\nkickbacks, however, were disguised as payments for Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nwork on the voter-awareness contract.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f     Mr. Kupfer contends that the government dropped this theory at\n\ntrial, but the government never wavered from this theory. At trial,\n\nfor example, the government explained its conspiracy allegation in\n\nopening statements:\n\n            And you may ask why during the course of this\n     trial, why the Defendant Gutierrez would pay $750,000 to\n     Defendant Joseph Kupfer. The evidence, as I previously\n     mentioned, is going to show that there were favors back\n     and forth between these two men over the course of the\n     years, political allies, friends. But $750,000? Here\u2019s what\n     you\u2019re also going to learn, that in addition to the [voter-\n     awareness] contract that the defendant had with the\n     Secretary of State\u2019s office during this time frame, he also\n\n                                 -12-\n\f      had contracts with the Attorney General\u2019s office where\n      Elizabeth Kupfer was the chief financial officer. And\n      these were lucrative contracts, you will learn.\n\nR., vol. VIII, at 1383\u201384. The government then discussed the\n\namendments to Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s anti-smoking contract, which\n\nincreased his pay from $150,000 to over $1,100,000. Id. at 1384. The\n\ngovernment repeated this theory in closing argument. Id. at 2931\u201333.\n\nIn our view, the government\u2019s theory has been consistent throughout\n\nthe proceedings.\n\n      In these circumstances, the district court had the discretion to\n\ntreat the evidence as intrinsic.\n\n      b.    Unfair Prejudice\n\n      Mr. Kupfer also contends that the district court erred in\n\napplying Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Under this rule, the district\n\ncourt can exclude evidence if the probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 403. The\n\ndistrict court concluded that the danger of unfair prejudice did not\n\nrequire exclusion.\n\n      In reviewing this conclusion, we apply the abuse-of-discretion\n\nstandard. United States v. Archuleta, 737 F.3d 1287, 1292 (10th Cir.\n\n2013). Under this standard, the ruling was permissible.\n\n      The court could reasonably view the evidence as highly\n\nprobative. Mr. Kupfer acknowledges that the anti-smoking contract\n\n                                   -13-\n\fwas \u201chighly suspicious\u201d because it \u201cballooned Gutierrez\u2019s pay by\n\nover $800,000.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 31.\n\n\n\n     The Increases in Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s Anti-Smoking Contract\n\n\n\n\n     The biggest jumps occurred in May 2004 and December 2004,\n\nwith amendments that increased Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s compensation by\n\n$250,000 and then $350,000. Between these two huge jumps, Dr.\n\nGutierrez paid Mr. Kupfer\u2019s company $140,000, before Mr. Kupfer\n\nhad done any work on the anti-smoking campaign.\n\n     And within thirteen months of obtaining the unexplained\n\nincrease of $350,000 under the anti-smoking contract, Dr. Gutierrez\n\npaid Mr. Kupfer\u2019s company another $200,000. Mr. Kupfer ultimately\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fcollected a total of $746,375 for work on the voter-awareness\n\ncontract.\n\n      But even after being subpoenaed, Dr. Gutierrez never furnished\n\na contract between himself and Mr. Kupfer (or Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nconsulting company) and took two years to furnish invoices that had\n\nbeen subpoenaed. And in the invoices eventually furnished, Mr.\n\nKupfer had provided only vague descriptions of his work (without\n\nany itemization).\n\n      In these circumstances, the district court could view the\n\n$746,375 in payments to Mr. Kupfer\u2019s company as compensation for\n\nthe extraordinary increases in Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s anti-smoking contract.\n\nAs a result, the court could reasonably view evidence of the anti-\n\nsmoking contract as highly probative.\n\n      Under Rule 403, the court could still exclude the evidence if\n\nthe probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice. But the court could reasonably view any prejudice\n\nas fair, rather than unfair.\n\n      In urging unfair prejudice, Mr. Kupfer denies involvement in\n\nthe numerous increases in Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s anti-smoking contract.\n\nMr. Kupfer says it was his wife, not himself, with the connections\n\nand position to engineer these price increases. According to Mr.\n\nKupfer, the evidence was unfairly prejudicial because the jury could\n\n                                 -15-\n\fimpermissibly find him guilty by association because of his wife\u2019s\n\nconduct, without finding any wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Kupfer.\n\n      But the district court could view the situation differently. There\n\nwas evidence that both Kupfers (not just Ms. Kupfer) had strong ties\n\nto the Secretary of State. And sandwiched between two extraordinary\n\ncompensation increases for Dr. Gutierrez were equally generous,\n\nunexplained payments from Dr. Gutierrez to the company owned by\n\nMr. Kupfer, not his wife. In these circumstances, the district court\n\ncould reasonably conclude that Mr. Kupfer was being held\n\naccountable for his own role\u2015not his wife\u2019s\u2015in the huge increases\n\npaid to Dr. Gutierrez under the anti-smoking contract. 9 Thus, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in applying Rule 403.\n\n      2.    Elder-Abuse Contract\n\n      The district court allowed the government to use evidence of a\n\ncontract between Dr. Gutierrez and the Attorney General\u2019s office to\n\ncreate media materials raising awareness of elder abuse, dubbing the\n\n9\n      Mr. Kupfer relies on United States v. Cardall, 885 F.2d 656,\n671 (10th Cir. 1989). Cardall does not support Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\nargument. There we explained that the government must give a\nprecise reason for introduction of evidence requiring a prior bad act,\nand the reason must involve the defendant\u2019s participation in the bad\nact. 885 F.2d at 671.\n\n      Here, the government provided the precise reason for\nintroduction of the evidence; that reason involved Mr. Kupfer\u2019s own\n\u201cbad act,\u201d a scheme to obtain kickbacks for inflating Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s\npayments from the State.\n                                 -16-\n\fcontract the \u201cElder-Abuse Contract.\u201d The government alleged no\n\nwrongdoing with respect to that contract, offering it only as an\n\nexample of a legitimate baseline to compare the cost of the anti-\n\nsmoking campaign. Mr. Kupfer argues the district court erred in\n\nallowing use of the elder-abuse contract because there was no link\n\nbetween him and the evidence. We need not reach this argument for\n\ntwo reasons:\n\n      1.    The elder-abuse contract could have been admissible as\n            probative evidence unrelated to character.\n\n      2.    Any error in admitting the evidence would have been\n            harmless.\n\n      a.    The Admissibility of the Elder-Abuse Contract\n\n      Under Federal Rule of Evidence 402, all relevant evidence is\n\nadmissible unless otherwise stated by federal law or rule. Rule\n\n404(b) provides an example of a rule stating otherwise, for this rule\n\nprecludes evidence of other acts. United States v. Commanche, 577\n\nF.3d 1261, 1267 (10th Cir. 2009). But this rule precludes the use of\n\nevidence only when it is offered to attack a witness\u2019s character. Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 404(b); see United States v. Kendall, 766 F.2d 1426, 1436\n\nn.5 (10th Cir. 1985) (\u201cTo fall within the scope of 404(b), an act need\n\nnot be criminal, so long as it tends to impugn a defendant\u2019s\n\ncharacter.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f     The evidence of an elder-abuse contract is not subject to Rule\n\n404(b) because it does not concern character. The government\n\noffered the evidence only to illustrate a legitimate contract between\n\nDr. Gutierrez and the New Mexico Attorney General\u2019s Office. Under\n\nthe contract, Dr. Gutierrez received $63,418.92 (for which there was\n\nno allegation of wrongdoing). R., vol. VIII, at 1861\u201362. By\n\ncomparison, Dr. Gutierrez received over $1.1 million for similar\n\nwork under the suspect anti-smoking contract. Id. at 1867.\n\n     Once the anti-smoking contract was admitted, the elder-abuse\n\ncontract became relevant to show Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s normal billing rate\n\nfor a legitimate media contract. Because there was no suggestion of\n\nwrongdoing in connection with the elder-abuse contract, there was no\n\ndanger involving use of the contract as character evidence.\n\n     Minimal danger arose from this benign evidence and it had\n\nprobative value; thus, the evidence was relevant and was not subject\n\nto exclusion under Rule 403 or Rule 404(b).\n\n     b.    Harmless Error\n\n     Even if the district court had erred in admitting the elder-abuse\n\ncontract evidence, it would have been harmless.\n\n     We will not reverse a defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of a\n\ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous admission of evidence if the error was\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fharmless to the defendant. United States v. Blechman, 657 F.3d 1052,\n\n1067 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n     Under this standard, we ask if the error had a \u201csubstantial\n\ninfluence\u201d on the trial\u2019s outcome or generates \u201c\u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to\n\nwhether it had such effect.\u201d United States v. Rivera, 900 F.2d 1462,\n\n1470 (10th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States,\n\n328 U.S. 750, 756 (1946)). To make this assessment, we review the\n\nentire record de novo, \u201cexamining the context, timing, and use of the\n\nerroneously admitted evidence at trial and how it compares to\n\nproperly admitted evidence.\u201d United States v. Hanzlicek, 187 F.3d\n\n1228, 1237 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n     The government showed that any error would have been\n\nharmless, for the elder-abuse contract had played only a minor role in\n\nthe trial. On that contract, the government asked one witness five\n\ngeneral questions. R., vol. VIII, at 1861\u201362. These questions\n\npertained only to the amount of the fees ($63,418.92) and\n\nidentification of Ms. Kupfer as the person overseeing the contract.\n\nId. In these questions and answers, there was no suggestion of\n\nwrongdoing with respect to that contract. Id. And in closing\n\nargument, the prosecutor never even mentioned the elder-abuse\n\ncontract. In these circumstances, we conclude that the evidence\n\nregarding the elder-abuse contract did not substantially influence the\n\n                                 -19-\n\ftrial or generate grave doubt about the outcome. Accordingly, any\n\nerror would have been harmless.\n\nII.   Issues Involving Procedural Reasonableness of the\n      Sentence\n\n      After entering a judgment of conviction, the district court\n\nsentenced Mr. Kupfer for all offenses. In deciding on the sentence,\n\nthe court calculated the guideline range. According to Mr. Kupfer,\n\nthe calculations were incorrect because the court had (1) selected the\n\nwrong guideline for the offense, and (2) improperly enhanced the\n\nsentence based on obstruction of justice. We agree with both of\n\nMr. Kupfer\u2019s arguments.\n\n      A.    Applicable Offense Guideline\n\n      When calculating the appropriate guideline, the district court\n\nstarted by evaluating the trial evidence. R., vol. VIII, at 3253\u201361.\n\nMr. Kupfer argues this approach constituted error because the court\n\nshould have considered only the offense of conviction as charged and\n\npresented to the jury. We agree.\n\n      In reviewing the district court\u2019s selection of the applicable\n\noffense guideline, we engage in de novo review. See United States v.\n\nNeilson, 721 F.3d 1185, 1187 (10th Cir. 2013). 10 Applying de novo\n\n\n10\n      The government argues that the clear-error standard applies\nbecause the selection of the offense guideline turns on factual\nfindings. As discussed below, we disagree. The district court\n                                   -20-\n\freview, we conclude that the district court incorrectly chose the\n\noffense guideline.\n\n      To determine the offense guideline in this case, the court had to\n\nengage in a three-step process 11:\n\n      1.      identifying the charge from the indictment and jury\n              instructions,\n\n      2.      finding the substantive offense in the guidelines\u2019\n              statutory index, and\n\n      3.      finding the applicable guideline range.\n\nSee U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.2 (U.S. Sentencing\n\nComm\u2019n 2012) (explaining the process for determining the applicable\n\nguideline).\n\n      The district court should have begun by identifying the charge\n\nas one involving conspiracy to steal funds. In the superseding\n\nindictment, Mr. Kupfer was charged with two types of conspiracy\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371: (1) to steal federal money in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 641, and (2) to defraud the federal government. R., vol. I, at\n\n11\u201320 (Count 1). But the court instructed the jury only on the first\n\n\nmistakenly relied on trial evidence to select the offense guideline. As\nwe explain, selection of the offense guideline entails a three-step\nprocess involving legal determinations rather than factual findings.\n11\n      We do not necessarily prescribe this three-step process in every\ncase. In our case, however, these three steps are necessary for the\ncourt to identify the offense guideline based on the indictment and\njury instructions.\n                                     -21-\n\ftype of conspiracy: to steal federal money in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 641. The jury was never instructed on the government\u2019s fraud\n\ntheory. Thus, we know that Mr. Kupfer was ultimately convicted\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 for conspiracy to steal federal money.\n\n     When assessing a conspiracy conviction, the sentencing\n\nguidelines instruct courts to choose the guideline provision that best\n\nfits the substantive offense underlying the conspiracy or use the\n\ngeneral conspiracy guideline. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 1B1.2, 2X1.1 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2012). Here, the\n\nsubstantive offense involves a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. Thus, we\n\nturn to the statutory index to determine the guideline provision for\n\n\u00a7 641.\n\n     In the guidelines\u2019 statutory index, \u00a7 641 is paired with two\n\npossible guidelines: (1) \u00a7 2B1.5 and (2) \u00a7 2B1.1.\n\n     The first possibility (\u00a7 2B1.5) involves stealing or damaging\n\ncultural heritage and paleontological resources. U.S. Sentencing\n\nGuidelines Manual \u00a7 2B1.5 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2012). That\n\nprovision is obviously inapplicable to our facts.\n\n     The second option (\u00a7 2B1.1) is a general provision covering\n\ntheft, which fits the conspiracy to steal federal money. Thus, \u00a7 2B1.1\n\nprovides the applicable offense guideline.\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f       The government disagrees, arguing that the applicable offense\n\nguideline is \u00a7 2C1.1. To get to \u00a7 2C1.1, the government points out\n\nthat the conspiracy was charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Section 371\n\nappears in the statutory index and is paired with multiple guidelines.\n\nTwo of these are \u00a7 2X1.1 and \u00a7 2C1.1. See U.S. Sentencing\n\nGuidelines Manual app. A, at 537 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2012).\n\nThe government insists that of these guidelines, \u00a7 2C1.1 presents the\n\nclosest fit. 12\n\n       When more than one guideline section is listed, the statutory\n\nindex instructs the court to \u201cuse the guideline most appropriate for\n\nthe offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was\n\nconvicted.\u201d Id., app. A, at 532. When the conviction involves a\n\nconspiracy, the court must \u201crefer to \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation,\n\nor Conspiracy) as well as the guideline referenced in the Statutory\n\nIndex for the substantive offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1B1.2(a). Section 2X1.1 is a\n\ngeneral catch-all provision that instructs courts to apply a more\n\nspecific guideline section when a conspiracy is expressly covered by\n\nthat section. Id. \u00a7 2X1.1(c)(1).\n\n       According to the government, the conspiracy is expressly\n\ncovered by \u00a7 2C1.1. We disagree.\n\n12\n      The government acknowledges that the other possible guideline\nprovisions listed in the statutory index (under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371) do\nnot apply. See Appellee\u2019s Br. at 32.\n                                   -23-\n\f     To determine whether \u00a7 2C1.1 applies, we must determine how\n\nwe go about selecting the applicable guideline section. Mr. Kupfer\n\nargues that we simply compare\n\n     \u25cf     the charge in the indictment that resulted in the\n           conviction and\n\n     \u25cf     the corresponding provision in the guidelines\u2019 statutory\n           index.\n\nThe government argues that we should also consider the facts elicited\n\nat the trial about the nature of the charged conspiracy. In our view,\n\nhowever, that argument is foreclosed by a 2000 amendment to the\n\nsentencing guidelines (Amendment 591).\n\n     Prior to this amendment, the application notes suggested that\n\nthe court could often select the offense of conviction based on the\n\noffender\u2019s actual conduct. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n\u00a7 1B1.2 App. Note 3 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 1999). In\n\nAmendment 591, the Sentencing Commission deleted the application\n\nnote to clarify that the defendant\u2019s actual conduct bears on \u201crelevant\n\nconduct,\u201d which comes into play only after the court selects the\n\noffense of conviction. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, App. C\n\n(U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n Supp. 2000); see United States v. Moreno,\n\n421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (\u201cAmendment\n\n591 requires that the initial selection of the offense guideline be\n\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fbased only on the statute or offense of conviction rather than on\n\njudicial findings of actual conduct not made by the jury.\u201d).\n\n      The district court used the pre-2000 method when selecting the\n\noffense of conviction. Instead of focusing solely on the charged\n\noffense, as Amendment 591 requires, the district court relied on the\n\ntrial evidence to identify the offense of conviction. In relying on the\n\ntrial evidence, the court found that (1) the evidence had shown that\n\nthe conspiracy involved fraud against the federal government and (2)\n\nthe conspiracy included participation by New Mexico\u2019s Secretary of\n\nState, an elected official. Based on these findings, the court\n\ncharacterized the conspiracy as one involving fraud and participation\n\nby a public official. With this characterization, the court concluded\n\nthat the offense of conviction triggered \u00a7 2C1.1.\n\n      Mr. Kupfer argues the court erred by considering these facts\n\nwhen selecting the applicable provision. We agree.\n\n      Under Amendment 591, a district court may consider other\n\nrelevant conduct later in the guideline calculation process, but not\n\nwhen selecting the offense of conviction. See United States v.

(stating that the offense\n\nguideline is based on the offense of conviction, not relevant\n\nconduct).\n\n      The district court determined that \u00a7 2C1.1 was appropriate only\n\nby examining the trial evidence in addition to the indictment and jury\n\ninstructions. At trial, the government theorized that Mr. Kupfer and\n\nDr. Gutierrez had conspired with the New Mexico Secretary of State.\n\nBecause the Secretary of State was a public official, the court\n\nthought \u00a7 2C1.1 would apply. But Mr. Kupfer would have been guilty\n\neven if the Secretary of State had been blameless. See United States\n\nv. Huizar-Velazquez, 720 F.3d 1189, 1192 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding\n\nthat \u00a7 2C1.1 did not provide the correct guideline because the crime\n\n\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\finvolved a scheme to trick the government out of its money rather\n\nthan to corrupt government officials). 13\n\n      Because \u00a7 2C1.1 does not expressly cover the offense as\n\ncharged, \u00a7 2X1.1 would apply if we were to focus on the conspiracy\n\ncharge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Because \u00a7 2X1.1 is a general\n\nconspiracy guideline, the court calculates the base offense level by\n\nreferring to the guideline for the underlying substantive offense that\n\nwas the object of the conspiracy. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n\u00a7 2X1.1(a) (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2012). As discussed above,\n\n\u00a7 2B1.1 appears in the statutory index and fits the substantive\n\noffense that was the objective of the conspiracy (violation of 18\n\n\n13\n      Mr. Kupfer relies on United States v. Neilson, 721 F.3d 1185\n(10th Cir. 2013). This reliance is misguided. As Mr. Kupfer points\nout, the Neilson panel did choose the offense guideline based in part\non the defendant\u2019s actual conduct. Neilson, 721 F.3d at 1188-89. But\nthere the defendant pleaded guilty and admitted his conduct in\nconnection with his guilty plea. Id. at 1186-87.\n\n       Even after adoption of Amendment 591, the guidelines have\nprovided a narrow exception to the general rule that requires\nselection of the offense of conviction based on the offense that was\ncharged in the indictment and that was the basis for the finding of\nguilt. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.2(a) (U.S.\nSentencing Comm\u2019n 2012). This exception involves guilty pleas.\nWhen a defendant pleads guilty and stipulates to a \u201cmore serious\noffense than the offense of conviction,\u201d the court must use the\noffense guideline applicable to the stipulated offense. Id.\n\n      This exception was applied in Neilson because there the\ndefendant pleaded guilty. Neilson, 721 F.3d at 1186-87. Mr. Kupfer\ndid not plead guilty, and this exception does not apply here.\n                                  -27-\n\fU.S.C. \u00a7 641). See id., app. A., at 539. Thus, if we were to focus on\n\nthe charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, we would still need to apply\n\n\u00a7 2B1.1 for the offense guideline.\n\n\n\n\n      When we apply \u00a7 2B1.1, we obtain a guideline range of 78\u201397\n\nmonths. See R., vol. VIII, at 3254 (the district court\u2019s\n\nacknowledgment that the base-offense level would have been 28\n\nunder \u00a7 2X1.1). The district court mistakenly used \u00a7 2C1.1 as the\n\noffense of conviction, which led to a guideline range of 121\u2013151\n\nmonths. See id. at 3258 (concluding that the base-offense level was\n\n32 based on \u00a7 2C1.1). That error requires reversal.\n\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\f      B.    Obstruction of Justice Enhancement\n\n      The district court made a second sentencing error, this one on\n\nthe calculation of the total offense level for the tax evasion counts.\n\nIn reaching that guideline, the court used an enhanced guideline on\n\nthe ground that Mr. Kupfer had obstructed justice by failing to reveal\n\nhis under-reporting of income.\n\n      The parties agree that this enhancement constituted error. We\n\ntoo agree, for we have held that enhancement for obstruction of\n\njustice is improper based on a defendant\u2019s failure to disclose his own\n\ncrime. See United States v. Kupfer (Elizabeth), __ F.3d __, 2015 WL\n\n4081108, at *6 (10th Cir. July 7, 2015) (discussing the issue in\n\nconnection with the obstruction of justice enhancement for Ms.\n\nKupfer\u2019s tax-evasion case). The parties also agree that this error\n\nbecame prejudicial once we concluded that Mr. Kupfer\u2019s total offense\n\nlevel should have been 28 rather than 32. Oral Arg. at 18:57\u201319:49. 14\n\nThus, the enhancement for obstruction of justice constitutes\n\nreversible error.\n\n\n\n\n14\n      The prejudice arises because of the corresponding adjustment\nto the offense guideline under the grouping rules. See U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.1\u20133D1.5 (U.S. Sentencing\nComm\u2019n 2012).\n                                  -29-\n\fIII.   Conclusion\n\n       We affirm the conviction. But we reverse and remand on the\n\nsentence with instructions to the district court to vacate the sentence\n\nand resentence Mr. Kupfer by (1) identifying the offense level under\n\n\u00a7 2B1.1 rather than \u00a7 2C1.1, and (2) removing the enhancement for\n\nobstruction of justice.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                                        FILED\n                                                                 United States Court of\n                                                                     Appeals\n                                                                     Tenth Circuit\n                              PUBLISH\n\n             UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                                                                      August 19, 2015\n\n                                                                 Elisabeth A.

In exchange for the increase, Dr. Gutierrez allegedly\n\ngave kickbacks to Mr. Kupfer through Mr. Kupfer\u2019s consulting\n\ncompany. The government alleged that Dr. Gutierrez had disguised\n\nthe kickbacks as payments for Mr. Kupfer\u2019s work on a separate media\n\ncampaign involving voter awareness.\n\n      The government successfully prosecuted Mr. Kupfer in two\n\ntrials. In the first, the jury found Mr. Kupfer and his wife guilty of\n\ntax evasion. In the second, the jury found Mr. Kupfer guilty of\n\nstealing and participating in a conspiracy to steal federal government\n\nproperty with a co-defendant, Dr. Gutierrez. The district court\n\nentered a judgment of conviction for these crimes and sentenced\n\nMr. Kupfer to ten years in prison. Mr. Kupfer appeals the conviction\n\nand sentence on all counts.\n\n      On appeal, we affirm the conviction and reverse and remand to\n\nthe district court for resentencing.\n\nI.    Issues Involving the Conviction\n\n      We start with Mr. Kupfer\u2019s challenges to the conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f      A.    Tax Evasion Trial\n\n      Mr. Kupfer and his wife jointly filed federal income taxes from\n\n2004 to 2006, but failed to report over $790,000 in gross income. The\n\ngovernment charged Mr. Kupfer with three counts of tax evasion and\n\naiding and abetting, one count for each year. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201;\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Mr. Kupfer admitted that he had failed to report a\n\nsubstantial amount of gross income, but denied that his under-\n\nreporting was willful. The jury disagreed and found Mr. Kupfer\n\nguilty on each count. On appeal, he challenges the adequacy of the\n\njury instructions and the district court\u2019s response to an allegation of\n\njury misconduct. 1 On both issues, we conclude that the district court\n\nacted within its discretion.\n\n      1.    Jury Instructions\n\n      The district court instructed the jury that it could find guilt\n\nonly if Mr. Kupfer\u2019s under-reporting of income had been willful.\n\nAccording to Mr. Kupfer, the court should have gone further,\n\ninstructing the jury that the under-reporting would not have been\n\nconsidered \u201cwillful\u201d if it had been merely negligent, inadvertent,\n\naccidental, mistaken, or reckless. We rejected this contention in\n\n1\n      Ms. Elizabeth Kupfer filed her own appeal in the tax evasion\ncase, and Mr. Kupfer joins in her arguments. See Fed. R. App. P.\n28(i).

Based on our opinion in that appeal, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court acted within its discretion in declining to include Mr.\n\nKupfer\u2019s proposed language.\n\n      2.    Juror Misconduct\n\n      After the trial ended, Ms. Kupfer submitted an affidavit from a\n\njuror stating that a fellow juror had commented about other charges\n\nduring jury deliberations. Based on this affidavit, Mr. Kupfer\n\nrequested a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct. The district\n\ncourt declined to conduct a hearing or grant a mistrial. We conclude\n\nthat these rulings fell within the district court\u2019s discretion because\n\nthe court could reasonably determine on the record it had that (1) a\n\nhearing was unnecessary and (2) the improper remarks were\n\nharmless.\n\n      When a defendant presents credible evidence of prejudicial\n\ninformation during jury deliberations, a presumption of prejudice\n\narises and the trial court must investigate.

July 7, 2015).\n\n      B.    Conspiracy Trial\n\n      The conspiracy trial involved allegations of overpayment to\n\nMr. Kupfer, ostensibly based on his subcontract to help on a media\n\ncampaign. This media campaign grew out of a federal grant to the\n\nState of New Mexico to increase voter awareness. With this grant,\n\nthe State paid millions to a consultant (Dr. Gutierrez), who in turn\n\npaid over $740,000 to Mr. Kupfer.\n\n      Dr. Gutierrez also had two other State contracts. One involved\n\nan anti-smoking campaign; the other involved an elder-abuse\n\ncampaign.\n\n      No misconduct is alleged with the elder-abuse campaign. But\n\nthe government argued at trial that Mr. Kupfer had influenced the\n\nState to amend the contract for the anti-smoking campaign, allowing\n\nDr. Gutierrez to obtain more than $950,000 in extra compensation.\n\n      According to the government, Mr. Kupfer earned only a small\n\nfraction of the $950,000+. The remainder, according to the\n\ngovernment, was a kickback to Mr. Kupfer for his role in getting\n\n                                   -5-\n\fDr. Gutierrez the increased compensation on his anti-smoking\n\ncontract.\n\n      Invoking this theory, the government charged Mr. Kupfer with\n\none count of conspiracy and three counts of stealing federal money or\n\nassisting another in stealing federal money. The jury found Mr.\n\nKupfer guilty on all counts, and he argues that the district court erred\n\nby admitting evidence of the anti-smoking and elder-abuse contracts.\n\n      1.    Evidence Involving the Anti-Smoking Contract\n\n      At trial, the government presented evidence of Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nrole in a contract between the New Mexico Attorney General\u2019s Office\n\nand Dr. Gutierrez. This contract called for Dr. Gutierrez to produce\n\ncommercials on smoking prevention and cessation.\n\n      Mr. Kupfer moved to preclude evidence of this contract,\n\narguing that (1) the evidence was not relevant and (2) it constituted\n\ninadmissible evidence of uncharged misconduct under Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 404(b). The court overruled the objection, holding that\n\n(1) the evidence was probative as intrinsic evidence and (2) the\n\nprobative value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\n\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\funfair prejudice. 2 We conclude that the district court acted within its\n\ndiscretion in admitting the evidence.\n\n      a.    Intrinsic Evidence\n\n      Mr. Kupfer challenges the characterization of the anti-smoking\n\ncontract as intrinsic evidence. We reject that challenge. The district\n\ncourt acted within its discretion in concluding that the evidence was\n\ninextricably intertwined with the charged conduct.\n\n      When we apply Rule 404(b), we distinguish between evidence\n\nthat is extrinsic or intrinsic to the charged crime.

See United\n\nStates v. Parker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171619\"><a href=\"/opinion/171619/united-states-v-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1315 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n     The district court regarded the anti-smoking contract as\n\nintrinsic because it (1) was intertwined with payments Dr. Gutierrez\n\nhad made to Mr. Kupfer and (2) showed Elizabeth Kupfer\u2019s\n\ninvolvement in issuing payments. R., vol. VIII, at 3081\u201382. The\n\ndistrict court based its ruling on the government\u2019s theory of the\n\nintertwined relationship between the federal grant and the anti-\n\nsmoking contract amendments, which is reflected by the timing of the\n\npayments to Mr. Kupfer.\n\n     Within five months of receiving a $250,000 increase in the\n\nanti-smoking contract, Dr. Gutierrez paid $140,000 to Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nconsulting company even though it had not yet begun work on the\n\nproject. Id. at 1866\u201367, 2620\u201321. The court could wonder why Dr.\n\n\n8\n     United States v. Hall, 508 F. App\u2019x 776, 779\u201380 (10th Cir.\n2013) (unpublished).\n                                  -9-\n\fGutierrez was willing to pay Mr. Kupfer\u2019s consulting company in\n\nadvance. See id. at 1808 (discussing the facts that \u201cthe contract\n\nbecame effective 9-9-04, and that invoice [for $2 million] came in\n\nthe day after\u201d).\n\n      Then, within thirteen months of the largest price increase under\n\nthe anti-smoking contract ($350,000), Dr. Gutierrez made three more\n\nmonthly payments (totaling $200,000) to Mr. Kupfer\u2019s consulting\n\ncompany.\n\n      Based on this timing, the jury could infer a connection between\n\n(1) Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s price increases under the anti-smoking contract\n\nand (2) his payments to Mr. Kupfer under the voter-awareness\n\ncontract.\n\n      Mr. Kupfer argues that the voter-awareness and anti-smoking\n\ncontracts were distinct because the contracts involved different\n\nagencies, only one of the contracts involved federal funds, and the\n\nanti-smoking contract preceded the voter-awareness contract by four\n\nyears. It is true that the contracts were distinct. But the government\n\ntheorized that Dr. Gutierrez had used money from the voter-\n\nawareness contract to pay Mr. Kupfer for increasing the payments\n\nunder the anti-smoking contract. Under this theory, both contracts\n\n(the voter-awareness and the anti-smoking contracts) were integral to\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthe scheme. The differences between the contracts did not invalidate\n\nthe government\u2019s theory.\n\n     According to Mr. Kupfer, the government changed its theory at\n\ntrial, characterizing the payments to Mr. Kupfer as kickbacks on the\n\nvoter-awareness contract (rather than for the price increases on the\n\nanti-smoking contract). This argument reflects Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nconfusion over the government\u2019s theory.\n\n     The government never accused Mr. Kupfer of doing something\n\nillegal to get Dr. Gutierrez the voter-awareness contract; the\n\ngovernment\u2019s theory\u2015before, during, and after the trial\u2015was that\n\nMr. Kupfer and his wife had worked to land Dr. Gutierrez over\n\n$950,000 in additional payments under the anti-smoking contract.\n\n     Under the government\u2019s theory, Dr. Gutierrez had to pay\n\nMr. Kupfer to secure the extra payments. Mr. Kupfer had no\n\nresponsibilities under the anti-smoking contract, but he had a\n\nsubcontract to help Dr. Gutierrez with the voter-awareness contract.\n\nThat subcontract involved Mr. Kupfer\u2019s production-related work on a\n\nshort training video. For that work, Dr. Gutierrez paid Mr. Kupfer\n\nover $740,000. The government attributed those payments to\n\nkickbacks for the anti-smoking contract\u2019s price increases. The\n\nkickbacks, however, were disguised as payments for Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nwork on the voter-awareness contract.\n\n                                 -11-\n\f     Mr. Kupfer contends that the government dropped this theory at\n\ntrial, but the government never wavered from this theory. At trial,\n\nfor example, the government explained its conspiracy allegation in\n\nopening statements:\n\n            And you may ask why during the course of this\n     trial, why the Defendant Gutierrez would pay $750,000 to\n     Defendant Joseph Kupfer. The evidence, as I previously\n     mentioned, is going to show that there were favors back\n     and forth between these two men over the course of the\n     years, political allies, friends. But $750,000? Here\u2019s what\n     you\u2019re also going to learn, that in addition to the [voter-\n     awareness] contract that the defendant had with the\n     Secretary of State\u2019s office during this time frame, he also\n\n                                 -12-\n\f      had contracts with the Attorney General\u2019s office where\n      Elizabeth Kupfer was the chief financial officer. And\n      these were lucrative contracts, you will learn.\n\nR., vol. VIII, at 1383\u201384. The government then discussed the\n\namendments to Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s anti-smoking contract, which\n\nincreased his pay from $150,000 to over $1,100,000. Id. at 1384. The\n\ngovernment repeated this theory in closing argument. Id. at 2931\u201333.\n\nIn our view, the government\u2019s theory has been consistent throughout\n\nthe proceedings.\n\n      In these circumstances, the district court had the discretion to\n\ntreat the evidence as intrinsic.\n\n      b.    Unfair Prejudice\n\n      Mr. Kupfer also contends that the district court erred in\n\napplying Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Under this rule, the district\n\ncourt can exclude evidence if the probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 403. The\n\ndistrict court concluded that the danger of unfair prejudice did not\n\nrequire exclusion.\n\n      In reviewing this conclusion, we apply the abuse-of-discretion\n\nstandard. United States v. Archuleta, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1292 (10th Cir.\n\n2013). Under this standard, the ruling was permissible.\n\n      The court could reasonably view the evidence as highly\n\nprobative. Mr. Kupfer acknowledges that the anti-smoking contract\n\n                                   -13-\n\fwas \u201chighly suspicious\u201d because it \u201cballooned Gutierrez\u2019s pay by\n\nover $800,000.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. at 31.\n\n\n\n     The Increases in Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s Anti-Smoking Contract\n\n\n\n\n     The biggest jumps occurred in May 2004 and December 2004,\n\nwith amendments that increased Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s compensation by\n\n$250,000 and then $350,000. Between these two huge jumps, Dr.\n\nGutierrez paid Mr. Kupfer\u2019s company $140,000, before Mr. Kupfer\n\nhad done any work on the anti-smoking campaign.\n\n     And within thirteen months of obtaining the unexplained\n\nincrease of $350,000 under the anti-smoking contract, Dr. Gutierrez\n\npaid Mr. Kupfer\u2019s company another $200,000. Mr. Kupfer ultimately\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fcollected a total of $746,375 for work on the voter-awareness\n\ncontract.\n\n      But even after being subpoenaed, Dr. Gutierrez never furnished\n\na contract between himself and Mr. Kupfer (or Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\n\nconsulting company) and took two years to furnish invoices that had\n\nbeen subpoenaed. And in the invoices eventually furnished, Mr.\n\nKupfer had provided only vague descriptions of his work (without\n\nany itemization).\n\n      In these circumstances, the district court could view the\n\n$746,375 in payments to Mr. Kupfer\u2019s company as compensation for\n\nthe extraordinary increases in Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s anti-smoking contract.\n\nAs a result, the court could reasonably view evidence of the anti-\n\nsmoking contract as highly probative.\n\n      Under Rule 403, the court could still exclude the evidence if\n\nthe probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice. But the court could reasonably view any prejudice\n\nas fair, rather than unfair.\n\n      In urging unfair prejudice, Mr. Kupfer denies involvement in\n\nthe numerous increases in Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s anti-smoking contract.\n\nMr. Kupfer says it was his wife, not himself, with the connections\n\nand position to engineer these price increases. According to Mr.\n\nKupfer, the evidence was unfairly prejudicial because the jury could\n\n                                 -15-\n\fimpermissibly find him guilty by association because of his wife\u2019s\n\nconduct, without finding any wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Kupfer.\n\n      But the district court could view the situation differently. There\n\nwas evidence that both Kupfers (not just Ms. Kupfer) had strong ties\n\nto the Secretary of State. And sandwiched between two extraordinary\n\ncompensation increases for Dr. Gutierrez were equally generous,\n\nunexplained payments from Dr. Gutierrez to the company owned by\n\nMr. Kupfer, not his wife. In these circumstances, the district court\n\ncould reasonably conclude that Mr. Kupfer was being held\n\naccountable for his own role\u2015not his wife\u2019s\u2015in the huge increases\n\npaid to Dr. Gutierrez under the anti-smoking contract. 9 Thus, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in applying Rule 403.\n\n      2.    Elder-Abuse Contract\n\n      The district court allowed the government to use evidence of a\n\ncontract between Dr. Gutierrez and the Attorney General\u2019s office to\n\ncreate media materials raising awareness of elder abuse, dubbing the\n\n9\n      Mr. Kupfer relies on United States v. Cardall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529387\"><a href=\"/opinion/529387/united-states-v-richard-taylor-cardall-united-states-of-america-v-barry/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n671 (10th Cir. 1989). Cardall does not support Mr. Kupfer\u2019s\nargument. There we explained that the government must give a\nprecise reason for introduction of evidence requiring a prior bad act,\nand the reason must involve the defendant\u2019s participation in the bad\nact. 885 F.2d at 671.\n\n      Here, the government provided the precise reason for\nintroduction of the evidence; that reason involved Mr. Kupfer\u2019s own\n\u201cbad act,\u201d a scheme to obtain kickbacks for inflating Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s\npayments from the State.\n                                 -16-\n\fcontract the \u201cElder-Abuse Contract.\u201d The government alleged no\n\nwrongdoing with respect to that contract, offering it only as an\n\nexample of a legitimate baseline to compare the cost of the anti-\n\nsmoking campaign. Mr. Kupfer argues the district court erred in\n\nallowing use of the elder-abuse contract because there was no link\n\nbetween him and the evidence. We need not reach this argument for\n\ntwo reasons:\n\n      1.    The elder-abuse contract could have been admissible as\n            probative evidence unrelated to character.\n\n      2.    Any error in admitting the evidence would have been\n            harmless.\n\n      a.    The Admissibility of the Elder-Abuse Contract\n\n      Under Federal Rule of Evidence 402, all relevant evidence is\n\nadmissible unless otherwise stated by federal law or rule. Rule\n\n404(b) provides an example of a rule stating otherwise, for this rule\n\nprecludes evidence of other acts. United States v. Commanche, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172571\"><a href=\"/opinion/172571/united-states-v-commanche/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1267 (10th Cir. 2009).

The government\n\noffered the evidence only to illustrate a legitimate contract between\n\nDr. Gutierrez and the New Mexico Attorney General\u2019s Office. Under\n\nthe contract, Dr. Gutierrez received $63,418.92 (for which there was\n\nno allegation of wrongdoing). R., vol. VIII, at 1861\u201362. By\n\ncomparison, Dr. Gutierrez received over $1.1 million for similar\n\nwork under the suspect anti-smoking contract. Id. at 1867.\n\n     Once the anti-smoking contract was admitted, the elder-abuse\n\ncontract became relevant to show Dr. Gutierrez\u2019s normal billing rate\n\nfor a legitimate media contract. Because there was no suggestion of\n\nwrongdoing in connection with the elder-abuse contract, there was no\n\ndanger involving use of the contract as character evidence.\n\n     Minimal danger arose from this benign evidence and it had\n\nprobative value; thus, the evidence was relevant and was not subject\n\nto exclusion under Rule 403 or Rule 404(b).\n\n     b.    Harmless Error\n\n     Even if the district court had erred in admitting the elder-abuse\n\ncontract evidence, it would have been harmless.\n\n     We will not reverse a defendant\u2019s conviction on the basis of a\n\ndistrict court\u2019s erroneous admission of evidence if the error was\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fharmless to the defendant.

On that contract, the government asked one witness five\n\ngeneral questions. R., vol. VIII, at 1861\u201362. These questions\n\npertained only to the amount of the fees ($63,418.92) and\n\nidentification of Ms. Kupfer as the person overseeing the contract.\n\nId. In these questions and answers, there was no suggestion of\n\nwrongdoing with respect to that contract. Id. And in closing\n\nargument, the prosecutor never even mentioned the elder-abuse\n\ncontract.

Accordingly, any\n\nerror would have been harmless.\n\nII.   Issues Involving Procedural Reasonableness of the\n      Sentence\n\n      After entering a judgment of conviction, the district court\n\nsentenced Mr. Kupfer for all offenses. In deciding on the sentence,\n\nthe court calculated the guideline range. According to Mr. Kupfer,\n\nthe calculations were incorrect because the court had (1) selected the\n\nwrong guideline for the offense, and (2) improperly enhanced the\n\nsentence based on obstruction of justice. We agree with both of\n\nMr. Kupfer\u2019s arguments.\n\n      A.    Applicable Offense Guideline\n\n      When calculating the appropriate guideline, the district court\n\nstarted by evaluating the trial evidence. R., vol. VIII, at 3253\u201361.\n\nMr. Kupfer argues this approach constituted error because the court\n\nshould have considered only the offense of conviction as charged and\n\npresented to the jury. We agree.\n\n      In reviewing the district court\u2019s selection of the applicable\n\noffense guideline, we engage in de novo review. See United States v.\n\nNeilson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187 (10th Cir. 2013). 10 Applying de novo\n\n\n10\n      The government argues that the clear-error standard applies\nbecause the selection of the offense guideline turns on factual\nfindings. As discussed below, we disagree. The district court\n                                   -20-\n\freview, we conclude that the district court incorrectly chose the\n\noffense guideline.\n\n      To determine the offense guideline in this case, the court had to\n\nengage in a three-step process 11:\n\n      1.      identifying the charge from the indictment and jury\n              instructions,\n\n      2.      finding the substantive offense in the guidelines\u2019\n              statutory index, and\n\n      3.      finding the applicable guideline range.\n\nSee U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.2 (U.S. Sentencing\n\nComm\u2019n 2012) (explaining the process for determining the applicable\n\nguideline).\n\n      The district court should have begun by identifying the charge\n\nas one involving conspiracy to steal funds. In the superseding\n\nindictment, Mr. Kupfer was charged with two types of conspiracy\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371: (1) to steal federal money in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 641, and (2) to defraud the federal government. R., vol. I, at\n\n11\u201320 (Count 1). But the court instructed the jury only on the first\n\n\nmistakenly relied on trial evidence to select the offense guideline. As\nwe explain, selection of the offense guideline entails a three-step\nprocess involving legal determinations rather than factual findings.\n11\n      We do not necessarily prescribe this three-step process in every\ncase. In our case, however, these three steps are necessary for the\ncourt to identify the offense guideline based on the indictment and\njury instructions.\n                                     -21-\n\ftype of conspiracy: to steal federal money in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 641. The jury was never instructed on the government\u2019s fraud\n\ntheory. Thus, we know that Mr. Kupfer was ultimately convicted\n\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 for conspiracy to steal federal money.\n\n     When assessing a conspiracy conviction, the sentencing\n\nguidelines instruct courts to choose the guideline provision that best\n\nfits the substantive offense underlying the conspiracy or use the\n\ngeneral conspiracy guideline. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n\u00a7\u00a7 1B1.2, 2X1.1 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2012). Here, the\n\nsubstantive offense involves a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. Thus, we\n\nturn to the statutory index to determine the guideline provision for\n\n\u00a7 641.\n\n     In the guidelines\u2019 statutory index, \u00a7 641 is paired with two\n\npossible guidelines: (1) \u00a7 2B1.5 and (2) \u00a7 2B1.1.\n\n     The first possibility (\u00a7 2B1.5) involves stealing or damaging\n\ncultural heritage and paleontological resources. U.S. Sentencing\n\nGuidelines Manual \u00a7 2B1.5 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2012). That\n\nprovision is obviously inapplicable to our facts.\n\n     The second option (\u00a7 2B1.1) is a general provision covering\n\ntheft, which fits the conspiracy to steal federal money. Thus, \u00a7 2B1.1\n\nprovides the applicable offense guideline.\n\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f       The government disagrees, arguing that the applicable offense\n\nguideline is \u00a7 2C1.1. To get to \u00a7 2C1.1, the government points out\n\nthat the conspiracy was charged under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. Section 371\n\nappears in the statutory index and is paired with multiple guidelines.\n\nTwo of these are \u00a7 2X1.1 and \u00a7 2C1.1. See U.S. Sentencing\n\nGuidelines Manual app. A, at 537 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 2012).\n\nThe government insists that of these guidelines, \u00a7 2C1.1 presents the\n\nclosest fit. 12\n\n       When more than one guideline section is listed, the statutory\n\nindex instructs the court to \u201cuse the guideline most appropriate for\n\nthe offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was\n\nconvicted.\u201d Id., app. A, at 532. When the conviction involves a\n\nconspiracy, the court must \u201crefer to \u00a7 2X1.1 (Attempt, Solicitation,\n\nor Conspiracy) as well as the guideline referenced in the Statutory\n\nIndex for the substantive offense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1B1.2(a). Section 2X1.1 is a\n\ngeneral catch-all provision that instructs courts to apply a more\n\nspecific guideline section when a conspiracy is expressly covered by\n\nthat section. Id. \u00a7 2X1.1(c)(1).\n\n       According to the government, the conspiracy is expressly\n\ncovered by \u00a7 2C1.1. We disagree.\n\n12\n      The government acknowledges that the other possible guideline\nprovisions listed in the statutory index (under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371) do\nnot apply. See Appellee\u2019s Br. at 32.\n                                   -23-\n\f     To determine whether \u00a7 2C1.1 applies, we must determine how\n\nwe go about selecting the applicable guideline section. Mr. Kupfer\n\nargues that we simply compare\n\n     \u25cf     the charge in the indictment that resulted in the\n           conviction and\n\n     \u25cf     the corresponding provision in the guidelines\u2019 statutory\n           index.\n\nThe government argues that we should also consider the facts elicited\n\nat the trial about the nature of the charged conspiracy. In our view,\n\nhowever, that argument is foreclosed by a 2000 amendment to the\n\nsentencing guidelines (Amendment 591).\n\n     Prior to this amendment, the application notes suggested that\n\nthe court could often select the offense of conviction based on the\n\noffender\u2019s actual conduct. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual\n\n\u00a7 1B1.2 App. Note 3 (U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n 1999). In\n\nAmendment 591, the Sentencing Commission deleted the application\n\nnote to clarify that the defendant\u2019s actual conduct bears on \u201crelevant\n\nconduct,\u201d which comes into play only after the court selects the\n\noffense of conviction.

Instead of focusing solely on the charged\n\noffense, as Amendment 591 requires, the district court relied on the\n\ntrial evidence to identify the offense of conviction. In relying on the\n\ntrial evidence, the court found that (1) the evidence had shown that\n\nthe conspiracy involved fraud against the federal government and (2)\n\nthe conspiracy included participation by New Mexico\u2019s Secretary of\n\nState, an elected official. Based on these findings, the court\n\ncharacterized the conspiracy as one involving fraud and participation\n\nby a public official. With this characterization, the court concluded\n\nthat the offense of conviction triggered \u00a7 2C1.1.\n\n      Mr. Kupfer argues the court erred by considering these facts\n\nwhen selecting the applicable provision.

This reliance is misguided. As Mr. Kupfer points\nout, the Neilson panel did choose the offense guideline based in part\non the defendant\u2019s actual conduct. Neilson, 721 F.3d at 1188-89. But\nthere the defendant pleaded guilty and admitted his conduct in\nconnection with his guilty plea. Id. at 1186-87.\n\n       Even after adoption of Amendment 591, the guidelines have\nprovided a narrow exception to the general rule that requires\nselection of the offense of conviction based on the offense that was\ncharged in the indictment and that was the basis for the finding of\nguilt. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.2(a) (U.S.\nSentencing Comm\u2019n 2012). This exception involves guilty pleas.\nWhen a defendant pleads guilty and stipulates to a \u201cmore serious\noffense than the offense of conviction,\u201d the court must use the\noffense guideline applicable to the stipulated offense.

See R., vol. VIII, at 3254 (the district court\u2019s\n\nacknowledgment that the base-offense level would have been 28\n\nunder \u00a7 2X1.1).
