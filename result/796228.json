Section 211-a restricts employers from spending monies derived from the State to hire employees or contractors to attempt to influence union organizing campaigns. The district court held that enforcement of section 211-a is preempted by the National Labor Relations Act, commonly known as the NLRA.

They allege that they or their members receive funds to pay for services rendered, including Medicaid payments, that have at one time been appropriated by New York. In addition to sales of services, they allege that they receive funds from New York to support services they provide, such as training residents and interns and charity health care.

They further allege that monies that they receive from local governments may be considered covered by section 211-a because the local governments received the money from the State: \"[T]here is no limitation in the statute as to when in the funding `chain,' the funds cease to retain and lose their character as state-appropriated monies.\" They also allege that federal monies are disbursed through the State, so that federal monies are also covered by section 211-a. \"It is, therefore, impossible to determine what funds, no matter how tenuously connected to state appropriations, are subject to the prohibitions of section 211-a.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They further allege that the State Attorney General has interpreted section 211-a to restrict their use of Medicaid funds, including the portion of such funds contributed by the federal government.

The State sought to convert its Rule 12(b)(6) motion to a motion for summary judgment, but because the district court viewed the issue as \"predominately legal,\" the court treated both the associations' and the State's motions as motions for judgment on the pleadings, taking into account only those documents that would be considered on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. <i>Healthcare Ass'n of New York State, Inc. v.

The district court held that the restrictions section 211-a places on an employer's ability to communicate distort the union organizing process instituted by the NLRA. <i>Id.</i> at 23. The court held that the threat of an enforcement proceeding by the Attorney General and of the penalties, including a fine of treble the amount wrongfully spent, would tie employers' hands during union-organizing campaigns, thus depriving employers of an economic weapon the NLRA reserved to them. <i>Id.</i> at 24. The record-keeping requirement was also sufficiently onerous to affect employers' ability to communicate as allowed by the NLRA. <i>Id.</i> The district court therefore held that section 211-a interferes with the campaign process provided by the NLRA and is preempted under the <i>Machinists</i> doctrine. <i>Id.</i> at 24-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also determined that section 211-a should not be exempt from <i>Machinists</i> preemption on the ground that the State is acting as a market participant rather than as regulator. The court held that the broad application of section 211-a, which reaches all employers who receive monies appropriated by the State for any purpose, is not typical of a market participant's efforts to address a specific proprietary problem or project. <i>Id.</i> at 17-19. Moreover, notwithstanding the legislative findings announcing that the purpose of section 211-a is to make sure the State gets its money's worth when it pays for goods and services, the district court held that the most prominent effect of the statute is to distort the balance of power in unionization campaigns, rather than to protect the State's spending power. <i>Id.</i> at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court determined that section 211-a is preempted under the <i>Machinists</i> doctrine, it did not go on to decide whether it is also preempted or unconstitutional under the other theories raised. <i>Id.</i> at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court granted the associations' motion, declared section 211-a preempted by the NLRA, and permanently enjoined the State from implementing or enforcing the statute. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State appeals, arguing that section 211-a does not interfere with employers' rights under the NLRA, nor does it deprive employers of economic weapons meant to be left available to them. The State argues that it is entitled to make sure that it gets what it pays for, and because of the complexities of the health-care system, the substantive and accounting requirements of section 211-a are a reasonable method of making sure that State monies are not misused.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by addressing the procedural issue of what kind of order we are reviewing. The State initially moved the district court to dismiss the amended complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), and the associations sought summary judgment. The State later asked to convert its motion to one for summary judgment because it had filed a number of evidentiary exhibits that would not properly be before the court on a motion to dismiss, and in particular, the State sought permission to file a number of exhibits after the hearing. The associations opposed the filing of the post-hearing exhibits and opposed the conversion of the motion to dismiss, arguing that they would need discovery in order to respond to a motion for summary judgment. The district court ruled that, because the issues before it were \"predominately legal,\" the court would decide the motions on the pleadings, taking into account only those documents which would be considered in a motion on the pleadings. <i>Healthcare Ass'n of New York State, Inc. v.

The associations' only motion was for summary judgment and indeed, it would be impossible to treat their motion as one for judgment on the pleadings, since the State has not filed an answer and the pleadings therefore are not closed. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c) (motion for judgment on pleadings may be made after pleadings closed).

The second type of preemption, <i>Machinists</i> preemption, preempts regulations that do not impinge on the protections and prohibitions of sections 7 and 8, but rather interfere with the NLRA's plan to leave certain areas unregulated, whether by the states or even by the NLRB. <i>Lodge 76, Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></a></span>. The danger from the first kind of conflict is that the State will require different behavior than that prescribed by the NLRA (the substantive concern); the danger from the second is that the State will provide different consequences for the behavior (the remedial concern); and the danger from the third is that Congress's design to entrust labor questions to an expert tribunal&#8212;the NLRB&#8212;would be defeated by state tribunals exercising jurisdiction over labor questions (the primary jurisdiction concern). To protect against such conflicts, preemption would obviously be required \"[w]hen it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by &#167; 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under &#167; 8.\" <i>Id.</i> at 244, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105866\"><a href=\"/opinion/105866/san-diego-building-trades-council-v-garmon/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Because the opportunity to invoke the NLRB's jurisdiction depends on bringing an unfair labor practice proceeding, the primary jurisdiction interest will ordinarily be invoked in cases where the conduct at issue was arguably prohibited by the NLRA. <i>See Sears, Roebuck,</i> 436 U.S. at 197, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109862\"><a href=\"/opinion/109862/sears-roebuck-co-v-carpenters/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Justice Stevens wrote that where the state regulation affects conduct arguably protected by the NLRA, it may be impossible for the party seeking an adjudication to bring the dispute before the NLRB in the form of an unfair labor practice proceeding. <i>Sears, Roebuck,</i> 436 U.S. at 201-03, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109862\"><a href=\"/opinion/109862/sears-roebuck-co-v-carpenters/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1745</span></a></span>. In such cases, the NLRB's primary jurisdiction will not be in danger. However, where the conduct in issue is arguably protected by the NLRA, there is a substantive Supremacy Clause concern that the state tribunal could restrict or hamper federally protected rights; therefore, the state proceeding or regulation could be preempted even if the controversy is not one which the parties could bring before the NLRB. See 436 U.S. at 199-200, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109862\"><a href=\"/opinion/109862/sears-roebuck-co-v-carpenters/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But where there is no threat to the NLRB's primary jurisdiction, the propriety of preemption depends on \"the strength of the argument that &#167; 7 [or here, &#167; 8(c)] does in fact protect the disputed conduct,\" 436 U.S. at 203, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109862\"><a href=\"/opinion/109862/sears-roebuck-co-v-carpenters/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Next, we must decide whether the controversy is identical to one that the aggrieved party could bring (or induce its adversary to bring) before the NLRB. If not, the State's action could still be preempted, but only if there is a strong showing that the State has interfered with the protections offered by section 7 or 8 of the NLRA.

The associations have no valid claim that section 211-a affects their rights under section 7, since section 7 only confers rights on employees, not on employers. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 157 (codifying section 7 of NLRA).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The associations' stronger argument is that section 8(c) of the NLRA protects their right to direct non-coercive speech to their employees during the course of a unionization campaign. Section 8(c)(codified at 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(c)) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State contends that section 8(c) does not protect speech because the First Amendment&#8212;not the NLRA&#8212;is the source of any employer free speech protections in the union organizing context. This view is supported by the Ninth Circuit's opinion in <i>Chamber of Commerce v.

While we agree that the history of section 8(c) confirms that Congress meant the section to coincide with the First Amendment, this does not mean that section 8(c) is a mere place-holder with no labor law function of its own. The history of the section shows that the contours of the First Amendment in a labor context are intertwined with and shaped by the NLRA rights and restrictions governing the same conduct, and by section 8(c) in particular. The legislative history and subsequent interpretation of section 8(c) demonstrate that the provision was meant to expand speech rights in the labor context; we therefore conclude that section 8(c) itself protects employer speech and that state action impinging on this protection may be preempted under <i>Garmon</i>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The earliest interpretation of the NLRA was that it imposed significant limitations on employer speech.

In other words, the employer's entitlement to free speech is not categorical, but limited by the NLRA concept of coercion; to avoid coercion as defined in section 8(c), the NLRB can limit the content of employer speech more severely than would be permissible if the NLRA rights of the employees were not simultaneously affected. <i>See id.</i> The interdependence of the First Amendment and the labor laws described in <i>Gissel</i> surely refutes the notion that speech rights are not the business of the NLRA and should not be the basis for <i>Garmon</i> preemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Many courts, including this one, have affirmed that section 8(c) not only protects constitutional speech rights, but also serves a labor law function of allowing employers to present an alternative view and information that a union would not present. \"Granting an employer the opportunity to communicate with its employees does more than affirm its right to freedom of speech; it also aids the workers by allowing them to make informed decisions while also permitting them a reasoned critique of their unions' performance.\" <i>NLRB v.

It is surely a familiar concept that one way of granting rights is to state that the government cannot punish certain conduct. For instance, the First Amendment does not explicitly grant freedom of speech, but instead says that \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const. amend. I. Obviously, we interpret the First Amendment as protecting free speech.

Moreover, the labor law cases cited above at page 99, affirm the idea that section 8(c) embodies a policy of encouraging free speech in the labor context; such a policy necessarily entails freedom from state meddling as well as freedom from restriction by the NLRB.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Atelson amici argue that section 8(c) does not confer rights because it only applies in unfair labor practice proceedings, not in representation proceedings, which are governed by the \"laboratory conditions\" doctrine,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>see Dal-Tex Optical Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">1782</span></span>, 1786-87 &amp; n. 11 (1962).

Employer speech can still be \"protected\" from designation as an unfair labor practice, even if the speech has other legal consequences&#8212;such as upsetting laboratory conditions. The fact that section 8(c) grants only limited protection for campaign speech does not mean that it gives no protection at all, and the State and amici point to nothing in the <i>Garmon</i> line of authority that suggests that an activity has to be absolutely immunized from all legal effect in order to be \"protected\" under the NLRA. The legislative history shows Congress amended the NLRA to give the parties freer rein to speak on labor issues, including organizing campaign issues, than they had previously been afforded, though not absolutely free rein. Since this clearly reveals a policy choice by Congress, we must give that choice effect, even if the reform effected was somewhat modest. We therefore conclude that section 8(c) does protect employer speech in the unionization campaign context and can provide a basis for <i>Garmon</i> preemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we must determine whether section 211-a threatens the NLRB's primary jurisdiction. <i>Sears, Roebuck</i> declared that the primary jurisdiction rationale \"does not extend to cases in which an employer has no acceptable method of invoking, or inducing the Union to invoke, the jurisdiction of the Board.\" 436 U.S. at 202, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109862\"><a href=\"/opinion/109862/sears-roebuck-co-v-carpenters/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In this case, there is no need for such precision of demarcation, because section 211-a only applies to speech that \"encourages or discourages\" unionization, and that is clearly the kind of speech addressed by section 8(c). If, for instance, section 211(a) burdened speech only if the speech entailed a \"threat of retaliation or force,\" enforcing the law would require a court to interpret section 8(c) and thus to define the contours of the NLRA.

To the extent that section 211-a applies to grant monies (which the employers cannot contend is their own), the associations do not argue that the State cannot specify in advance what a grant may and may not be used for.

If so, the State's asserted rationale of assuring that it gets the services it pays for does not extend so far&#8212;preventing the associations and their members from using their proceeds in a particular way would not save the State any money or guarantee that the State received the goods or services for which it contracted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State does not deny the existence of some straightforward fixed-price contracts, but it responds that the Medicare and Medicaid systems are to some extent cost-based, so that if an employer incurs labor costs for opposing unionization, those costs would be included in figuring the rate at which the hospital was paid for services in the future. Consequently, how the associations and their members spend their money affects how much the State will have to pay for subsequent transactions. The associations dispute the assertion that their unionization campaign costs will affect the State's expenses. Sisto testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants suggest that the restrictions on spending in section 211-a are consistent with Medicare or Medicaid's not allowing such costs. That is an analogy that is legally and factually false. First, neither Medicare nor Medicaid reimbursement rates for hospitals are cost-based. Hospitals are reimbursed under a case-based prospective payment system. Under this system, a hospital gets paid a set fee based upon the diagnosis and severity of the condition of the patient. Labor-related expenditures are irrelevant to how much reimbursement is received for the patient's care.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even to the extent that the amount of the case-based rate has any relationship to costs, current hospital Medicaid payment calculations use 1983 costs as the `base' for determining the payment rate. Thus, the only costs that figure into today's Medicaid payments to hospitals are those incurred 20 years ago.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State responds that current labor costs can affect the price the State pays, and it cites New York Comp.Codes, Rules, &amp; Regs. tit 10, &#167; 86-1.46(a), under which the most recent two years are the baseline for computing the rates which the State will pay for care provided by community-based home health care agencies. We take it from this patently partial response that the State does not dispute that its obligations to pay under at least some cost-based provisions would not be reduced by prospectively reducing an employer's anti-union campaign costs. At any rate, these conflicting views of the facts may not be resolved on appeal or, indeed, on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there would seem to be a vastly simpler and more effective way to make sure that the State does not end up paying labor costs for such activities: the State could simply require such costs to be excluded when setting the price base. Cf. <i>Milwaukee County,</i> 431 F.3d at 280-81 (existence of more effective way of addressing problem creates inference that County's actual purpose was to engage in labor regulation). This is the method used in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395x(v)(1)(N), which the State contends is equivalent to section 211-a; but &#167; 1395x(v)(1)(N) simply says that such costs will not be reimbursable or will be excluded from the costs on which the price of services is calculated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The associations do not dispute that the State can determine which costs are allowable in a cost-based system.

This argument may well be correct, but it poses a question of fact&#8212;perhaps a question of expert opinion&#8212;that we may not resolve at this procedural stage. Moreover, even if some State expenditures are too complex to monitor performance without something akin to section 211-a, the amici do not deny that section 211-a does cover other straightforward contracts such as contracts for soap, under which the State cannot save money or improve the quality of the merchandise by restricting what the vendor does with its proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that, to the extent that section 211-a functions as a restriction on what use may be made of State grants, it is not preempted by <i>Garmon.</i> To the extent that section 211-a imposes restrictions on the associations' and their members' use of proceeds earned from state contracts and statutory reimbursement obligations in which the contractor's labor costs cannot affect the amount of expense to the State, it attempts to impose limitations on the use of the associations' money rather than the State's; it therefore deters employers from the exercise of their rights under section 8(c) and satisfies the threshold conditions for <i>Garmon</i> preemption. To the extent that the State has assumed cost-based obligations that allow contractors to be reimbursed for unionization campaign expenses, the State must demonstrate why it is not feasible for the State to avoid such expenses by designating such costs as non-reimbursable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The associations also contend that in the context of Medicare benefits, section 211-a's language allows the State to restrict employers' section 8(c) activities based on funds originally provided by federal and local governments, but which have merely passed through the State treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Numerous affidavits describe the Medicare system in which every service is paid for by a percentage of federally appropriated money and a percentage of State-appropriated money.

Sisto contends that the State claims section 211-a reaches and regulates an employer's use of monies paid for Medicare services, even the portion actually funded by the federal government and local governments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The affidavit of M. Patricia Smith, the Assistant Attorney General in Charge of the Labor Bureau, indicates that \"medicaid funds are subject to the statute.\" To the extent that section 211-a is interpreted to apply to funds that were originally appropriated by the federal government and only pass through the State en route to the contractors who have earned the funds, it would exceed the State's legitimate interest in controlling the use of its own money. Whether, in the context of providing Medicare and Medicaid services and in the other transactions between the State and the associations and their members, the federal monies truly \"pass through\" the State or whether they instead are subsidies of State spending decisions, is a question of fact that was not resolved in the district court and which the parties have not addressed in the kind of detail or comprehensiveness that would allow us to render a decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the application of section 211-a to all Medicaid money would restrict use of monies that were appropriated by local \"social services districts.\" Application of section 211-a to monies appropriated by \"social services districts\" may or may not be preempted, according to whether that money could be described as State appropriations \"passing through\" the local districts, which is, again, a question of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the State did not apply section 211-a to funds that originated with federal and local governments, Sisto contends that it would be impossible for an employer to distinguish between such funds and funds appropriated by the State, since the hospitals receive lump sum payments indicating only the amount for each patient: \"Each of these figures represents an amalgam of funds that had originated with the federal, state and local governments. The relative share of federal, state and local percentages are neither known nor disclosed to the provider-recipient.\" In such a system, putting the burden on the recipient of funds to identify and restrict the use of the State portion of the funds for certain expenses, at peril of ruinous fines, is different and more burdensome than simply refusing to fund certain activities in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, to the extent that section 211-a burdens the associations' use of federal and local monies that only pass through the State, it would constitute an attempt to regulate labor practices rather than a refusal to subsidize campaign costs. Moreover, even if section 211-a does not apply to federal and local monies, if it places a significant burden on the associations and their members to ascertain what portion of mixed payments are subject to State restrictions, it would burden the associations' and their members' exercise of their NLRA speech rights and would be preempted under <i>Garmon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that there are vital fact issues that must be determined before we can decide whether section 211-a is limited to a restriction on the use of State funds or whether it overreaches in an attempt to regulate the employers' speech regardless of whether State funds are at issue. First, we must know whether the State contends that section 211-a restricts employers' use of funds earned from fixed-price contracts with the State. If so, then section 211-a is broader than necessary to serve the efficiency purpose claimed by the State. Second, if the State maintains cost-based measures that allow reimbursement for unionization campaign expenses, the State must demonstrate why it is not feasible for the State to avoid such expenses by designating such costs as non-reimbursable. Finally, we must know whether section 211-a as applied does indeed create obligations upon receipt of monies that originated with federal and local governments. To the extent that the State applies section 211-a to burden the use of money that cannot be considered State funds, it burdens NLRA speech and satisfies the threshold conditions for <i>Garmon</i> preemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even after concluding that some applications of section 211-a supported by the record would satisfy the threshold for <i>Garmon</i> preemption, we must consider whether \"the regulated conduct touche[s] interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility,\" <i>Garmon,</i> 359 U.S. at 244, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105866\"><a href=\"/opinion/105866/san-diego-building-trades-council-v-garmon/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

These are the same questions that must be resolved in order to determine whether section 211-a restricts the associations' and their member's exercise of their NLRA speech rights, rather than merely refusing to subsidize that exercise.

As we have already discussed, it is well-established that an employer's speech rights do play a role in Congress's design for how employees decide whether a union will represent them. <i>See</i> page 99, <i>supra.</i> Though we conclude that the <i>Machinists</i> doctrine may well require preemption of section 211-a, the ultimate question depends on the same factors we considered relevant in our <i>Garmon</i> discussion: whether section 211-a burdens moneys that cannot properly be said to belong to the State (because they either belong to the contractors or to federal or local governments) and whether the State can accomplish its goal of saving money by limiting the kind of costs for which it will reimburse program participants.

The associations contend that by forbidding employers to use \"monies appropriated by the state\" to train supervisors to speak against unionization, to hire attorneys or consultants in connection with opposing an organizing drive, and to hire employees whose job is to oppose an organizing drive, the State has curtailed the employers' effective use of their right to speak to their employees about unionization. The State contends: \"Employers can and do oppose unionization vigorously notwithstanding &#167; 211-a.\" The State therefore contends that whether section 211-a affects employers' \"ability to engage in any activity as a practical matter is disputed\" and summary judgment should therefore not have been granted against the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We cannot agree that the degree to which the associations are actually able to mount effective campaigns should be determinative of <i>Machinists</i> preemption, for this will depend on how each plaintiff has chosen to earn its living.

We have held that the statute will only be preempted to the extent that it burdens an employer's use of monies earned from contracts or reimbursement obligations that do not include any costs associated with the three prohibited activities. With regard to such contracts or reimbursement obligations, the State's asserted proprietary interest in saving money is inapplicable. The State cannot save money by burdening the employer's use of contract proceeds, at least not if the State's future obligations cannot be shown to vary according to how the employers spend their money. Similarly, the State cannot save money by burdening the employer's use of monies belonging to federal and local governments, but merely passing through the State as paying agent.

Section 7 authorizes unions to engage in \"concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid for protection.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 157. Section 7 also extends protection to employees' concerted labor activities that occur on employer property. Section 8, on the other hand, prohibits several forms of picketing by employees, labeling them \"unfair labor practices.\" <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 158(b). Section 8 also prohibits employers from interfering with an employee's section 7 rights. <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 158(a). Amidst this array of protections and prohibitions, lies one provision-section 8(c)-with its own history and application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 8(c) addresses a specific problem. Prior to its enactment, the NLRB held that any employer speech expressing disfavor in the unionization process constituted an unfair labor practice. After the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Thomas v. Collins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104061\"><a href=\"/opinion/104061/thomas-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 536-37, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104061\"><a href=\"/opinion/104061/thomas-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span> (1945), Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which added section 8(c) to the NLRA. Section 8(c) ensures that employer speech does not constitute evidence of an unfair labor practice so long as the employer speech contains \"no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 158(c). By negating the possibility of an unfair labor practice suit against an employer who speaks without any threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit, section 8(c) is best seen as an exception from the broader category of prohibited conduct under section 8(a). In other words, section 8(c) limits the scope of section 8(a)'s prohibition on unfair labor practices by an employer. This serves to protect employer speech from sanction by the NLRB (the goal of the Taft-Hartley Act), rather than to grant to employers the right to fund unionization campaigns without state interference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For <i>Garmon</i> preemption to apply, section 211-a must in some way affect a party's rights or remedies under the NLRA, or in some way affect the NLRB's jurisdiction. Section 211-a does none of these things because an employer does not have a protected right to fund speech under section 8(c). Thus, <i>Garmon</i> preemption is inappropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not suggest <i>Garmon</i> preemption is impossible under section 8(c)-rather, that it is just not appropriate in this case. <i>Linn v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span> (1966) provides an example of how <i>Garmon</i> could preempt a state law conflict with section 8(c). In <i>Linn,</i> the Supreme Court found <i>Garmon</i> preemption appropriate for a state libel law that lacked a malice component. The Supreme Court expressed its concern that unless state libel laws required malice, they would frustrate section 8(c) by narrowing the universe of employer speech. The Supreme Court's analysis noted the limited scope of section 8(c): \"The wording of the statute indicates . . . that section 8(c) was not designed to serve [free debate on issues dividing labor and management] by immunizing <i>all statements</i> made in the course of a labor controversy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62 n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107162\"><a href=\"/opinion/107162/linn-v-plant-guard-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span> (emphasis added). In other words, the Court recognized that section 8(c) does not go so far as to create outright protections for employer speech in the labor context. If this had not been the case and Congress had actually immunized employer speech in section 8(c), the Supreme Court in <i>Linn</i> would have had a relatively easy task in determining that state libel laws were preempted under <i>Garmon.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let me offer several hypotheticals to show why I believe <i>Garmon</i> preemption is inappropriate in this case. The State seeks an accounting by an employer who used state funds to train persons to encourage or discourage union organization. No similar question could possibly arise under the NLRA because section 8(c) offers no protection against allegations of an employer's misuse of funds. Or a case may arise like <i>Linn,</i> where a state court has to determine whether an employer was attempting to \"encourage or discourage\" union organization in violation of section 211-a. But even a determination of whether the employer was encouraging or discouraging union organization does not trigger section 8(c) because it is only concerned with whether such speech is a threat-a much higher threshold than determining whether employer speech encourages or discourages unionization. As a result, I fail to see how <i>Garmon</i> works to preempt section 211-a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Preemption analysis is never easy. For me, the task is made insurmountable when broad protections are read into limited statutory provisions. My point of departure from my two colleagues is not one of semantics; it is a disagreement of focus. I agree with my colleagues that <i>Machinists</i> preemption ensures the free exchange of ideas between an employer and its employees about unionization as a matter of national labor policy. However that conclusion has nothing to do with the rights and remedies under the NLRA, or the jurisdiction of the NLRB.
