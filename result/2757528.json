We hold that the statute does not\n\fapply to prohibit a tax sale of these properties.\n\n\n        Twin Lakes Regional Sewer District is one of roughly 100 non-municipal regional sewer\ndistricts in Indiana, and it serves areas in Carroll and White counties. Richard Ray and Patricia\nAlford each own property served by the District. Both the Ray property and the Alford property\nhad outstanding sewer bills owed to the District, which had perfected liens against the properties\nand certified those liens to the Carroll County Auditor for collection with the upcoming property\ntax bill. On August 26, 2013, the Carroll County Treasurer and Auditor filed a joint affidavit and\njoint application for judgment against the listed properties ordering that the properties be sold at\na tax sale to satisfy obligations for the unpaid sewer bills owed the District.\n\n\n        The trial court entered the requested judgment, but in advance of the tax sale the land-\nowners each separately petitioned the trial court objecting to their respective properties being\nlisted for tax sale and asserting that \"[a]ll property taxes are paid on this property and the only\namount due is an attached sewer lien.\" Appellant's App'x at 8\u20139. Further, the landowners each\nrequested, in part, that the trial court find that their respective properties \"[cannot] be sold at tax\nsale\" pursuant to Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4. Id. The District intervened and requested a\nhearing to determine whether the Ray or the Alford property ought to be removed from the tax\nsale list. Following the hearing, the trial court found that the only outstanding lien on either\nproperty was owed exclusively to the District for unpaid sewer bills and ordered that both prop-\nerties be removed from the 2013 tax sale because \"[the District] maintains the only lien\" and as\nsuch \"is precluded from foreclosing on the parcels pursuant to [Indiana Code section]\n13-26-14-4.\" Id. at 7. The District then initiated this appeal and petitioned this Court to accept\njurisdiction pursuant to Appellate Rule 56(A), which we granted.\n\n\n        All parties agree that the central issue in this case is the interpretation of the last sentence,\nthe lien foreclosure prohibition clause, in Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4. See Appellees' Br. at\n2; Appellant's Br. at 1. Section 4 is the last of four brief sections comprising Chapter 14. Sec-\ntion 1 authorizes regional sewer districts to use lien foreclosure to collect rates, charges, and\npenalties. Ind. Code \u00a7 13-26-14-1. Section 2 permits such lien foreclosure actions to recover the\nrates, charges, penalties, and reasonable attorney's fees and expressly directs a court-ordered sale\n\n                                                    2\n\f\"without relief from valuation or appraisement statutes.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 13-26-14-2. Section 3\nstates that the lien foreclosures are subject to \"the laws concerning municipal public improve-\nment assessments\" and the \"rights, remedies, procedure, and relief granted the parties to the ac-\ntion.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 13-26-14-3. Section 4, however, limits the availability of lien foreclosure in\ncertain circumstances. In its entirety, Section 4 states:\n        Sec. 4. Rates fees, or charges made, assessed, or established by the district are a lien, in\n        the same manner established under IC 36-9-23 for municipal sewage works, on a lot, par-\n        cel of land, or building that is connected with or uses the works of the district. Liens un-\n        der this chapter [chapter 14]:\n                 (1) attach;\n                 (2) are recorded;\n                 (3) are subject to the same penalties, interest, and reasonable attorney's fees on re-\n                 covery, and\n                 (4) shall be collected and enforced:\n        in substantially the same manner as provided in IC 36-9-23-31 through IC 36-9-23-34. A\n        lien under this chapter that is the only lien on a property may not be foreclosed.\nInd. Code \u00a7 13-26-14-4 (emphasis added). 1 Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of\nlaw and are reviewed de novo. Pinnacle Properties Dev. Grp., LLC v. City of Jeffersonville, 893\nN.E.2d 726, 727 (Ind. 2008).\n\n\n        The District contends that the lien foreclosure prohibition clause in Section 4 does not\napply to tax sales, which are legally distinct from foreclosures under Indiana law. The District\nargues that a regional sewer district has three methods for collecting unpaid sewer bills and\npenalties 2 and that lien foreclosure is one of those methods. It argues that a foreclosure is a legal\nproceeding that \"terminates the owner's interest in property\" by selling the property itself and\ncutting off the owner's right of redemption, Appellant's Br. at 7, whereas a tax sale is a separate\navailable method of collection. Id. at 8. A tax sale \"does not terminate the rights of the owner\"\nand is not a sale of the real estate itself but rather a sale of a tax lien that \"is subject to a one year\n\n        1\n           The District's appeal also challenges the trial court's finding that the District was the only\nlienholder on the respective properties. In light of our resolution of the principal issue, this secondary\nclaim is not dispositive and will not be addressed.\n         2\n           The three methods of collection referred to by the District are: (1) the filing of a civil lawsuit\n(Indiana Code section 36-9-23-31); (2) the perfection and foreclosure of a lien on a customer's property\n(Indiana Code sections 36-9-23-34 and 13-26-14-1 et seq.); and (3) the certification of a lien to the county\nauditor for collection with property taxes (Indiana Code section 36-9-23-33). See Appellant's Br. at 5.\nThe landowners do not dispute the District's assertion that there are three methods by which a regional\nsewer district may collect delinquent bills and fees, but they argue that the prohibitive language in dispute\nin this case applies to both the second and third methods of collection.\n                                                     3\n\fperiod of redemption\" for the owner. Id. The District cites Indiana Code section 6-1.1-24-9(b),\nwhich provides that a tax sale purchaser has purchased \"a lien against the real property\" and not\nthe property itself, which practically and legally distinguishes a tax sale from a foreclosure. Id.\nThe District also urges that Indiana has a method for tax sale procedures that is found in Title 6\nof the Indiana Code and a separate method for the foreclosure of real estate that is found in Title\n32, and that the disputed language in this case, when read in context, mirrors the real estate fore-\nclosure language of Title 32 and not the tax sale language of Title 6. Id. at 12. Thus, the District\nargues that any prohibitive language for how collection may be conducted by a regional sewer\ndistrict under Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4 should only apply to the foreclosure method of\ncollection\u2014and not to the tax sale method of collection.\n\n\n       The landowners respond that the plain meaning of \"foreclosed\" in the last sentence ap-\nplies broadly to encompass both a traditional real estate foreclosure as well as a tax sale, which\nthey also refer to as a \"tax foreclosure.\" Appellees' Br. at 3. Focusing on the definition given in\nBlack's Law Dictionary and also McCollum v. Uhl, 27 N.E. 152, 154, 128 Ind. 304, 308 (1891),\nthe landowners argue that Indiana has \"historically recognized tax sales as a foreclosure pro-\ncess.\" Appellees' Br. at 3.\n\n\n       The issue is thus whether the lien foreclosure prohibition clause in Section 4 applies to\nprohibit a tax sale when the sewer bill lien is the only lien on the property. The clause declares:\n\"A lien under this chapter that is the only lien on a property may not be foreclosed.\" Ind. Code\n\u00a7 13-26-14-4. The parties do not dispute that the landowners' respective delinquent fees and\npenalties constitute a proper lien under Section 4, but they disagree regarding whether the lien\nforeclosure prohibition clause applies to tax sales.\n\n\n       The statutory language in controversy, Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4, is part of Title\n13, Article 26, which applies to regional sewer districts. The counterpart statutory provisions\ngoverning municipal sewer works are found in Title 36, Article 9. We note that the disputed\nprohibition on lien foreclosure is introduced by the phrase \"[a] lien under this chapter [Chapter\n14 of Article 26].\" Id. We understand this to appropriately identify the prohibition as applying\nonly to the foreclosure of liens by regional sewer districts and not to restrict municipal sewer lien\n\n                                                  4\n\fforeclosures. In discussing the liens \"under this chapter [Chapter 14 of Article 26],\" Section 4\ndirects that such liens \"shall be collected and enforced . . . in substantially the same manner\" as\nprovided in Sections 31\u201334 of Title 36, Article 9, Chapter 23, which applies to municipal sewer\nfee collection. These four sections establish three methods of collection of delinquent sewer fees\nand penalties and expressly distinguish liens created by assessed sewer fees from tax liens. Sec-\ntion 31 generally authorizes the municipality to bring a civil action to collect delinquent sewer\nfees. Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-23-31 (2012). Section 32 provides that sewer fees assessed against real\nproperty under Chapter 23 \"constitute a lien against the property assessed,\" which lien is superior\nto \"all other liens except tax liens.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-23-32(a) (2012). Section 33 provides that\ndelinquent fees, penalties, and charges shall be collected by the county treasurer \"in the same\nway that delinquent property taxes are collected.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-23-33(i) (2012). Finally,\nSection 34 authorizes municipal sewer works to \"foreclose a lien established by this chapter in\norder to collect fees and penalties.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-23-34(a) (2012). In summary, these four\nsections of Chapter 23 explain how a municipality\u2014and by reference under Indiana Code sec-\ntion 13-26-14-4, a regional sewer district\u2014may collect unpaid and delinquent sewer bills. Sec-\ntion 31 authorizes the filing of a civil lawsuit, Section 32 declares that sewer fee assessments\nconstitute a lien on affected property and distinguishes such liens from \"tax liens,\" Section 33\nauthorizes collection through the delinquent property tax method, and Section 34 authorizes\nforeclosure of assessed sewer liens. And while Sections 31 through 34 expressly authorize the\ncounty treasurer to collect assessed sewer fees in the manner of collecting delinquent property\ntaxes, which includes resort to a tax sale, these sections do not define sewer fee collection liens\nas \"tax liens\" or refer to a \"tax sale\" as a \"lien foreclosure,\" nor does Chapter 23 elsewhere \"es-\ntablish\" a \"tax lien\" subject to \"foreclosure.\" We conclude that a tax sale does not fall within the\nregional sewer district lien foreclosure prohibition.\n\n\n       We are not persuaded by landowners' arguments to the contrary. While Black's Law Dic-\ntionary may be useful in some circumstances, its legal definitions do not supersede the general\nEnglish language chosen by the Indiana General Assembly in crafting our statutes. In addition,\nwe do not find relevant precedential value in this Court's 1891 decision in McCollum. At issue\nthere was whether notice had been satisfied in accordance with a statutory requirement and\nwhether a lien owed to the State for delinquent taxes was superior to a lien for a ditch assess-\n\n                                                  5\n\fment. 27 N.E. at 153\u2013154, 128 Ind. at 307\u201308. The passing mention of a \"tax foreclosure sale\"\nin McCollum was obiter dicta, not a holding requiring application to the present facts and statu-\ntory language. See 27 N.E. at 154, 128 Ind. at 308.\n\n\n       We recognize the landowners' earnest opposition to their property being subject to re-\ngional sewer district fees and their belief that the legislature's enactment of the lien foreclosure\nprohibition clause provided them with immunity in the absence of other liens. We must be guid-\ned, however, by the language enacted and thus find that, while it precludes the foreclosure of as-\nsessed regional sewer district fee liens when such liens are the only liens on a property, this pre-\nclusion does not extend to collection of such fees and charges by tax sale.\n\n\n                                             Conclusion\n\n\n       The lien foreclosure prohibition of Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4, governing the col-\nlection of regional sewer district sewer liens, does not apply to collection by tax sale. Here, be-\ncause the District employed the tax sale method and did not seek collection of the Appellees' un-\npaid sewer bills and penalties through the lien foreclosure method, the lien foreclosure prohibi-\ntion clause does not apply. The judgment of the trial court removing the Ray and Alford proper-\nties from the tax sale list is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\nRush, C.J., Rucker, David, and Massa, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">ATTORNEY FOR APPELLANT ATTORNEY FOR APPELLEES                      ATTORNEYS FOR AMICUS CURIAE\nDonald J.

We hold that the statute does not\n\fapply to prohibit a tax sale of these properties.\n\n\n        Twin Lakes Regional Sewer District is one of roughly 100 non-municipal regional sewer\ndistricts in Indiana, and it serves areas in Carroll and White counties. Richard Ray and Patricia\nAlford each own property served by the District. Both the Ray property and the Alford property\nhad outstanding sewer bills owed to the District, which had perfected liens against the properties\nand certified those liens to the Carroll County Auditor for collection with the upcoming property\ntax bill. On August 26, 2013, the Carroll County Treasurer and Auditor filed a joint affidavit and\njoint application for judgment against the listed properties ordering that the properties be sold at\na tax sale to satisfy obligations for the unpaid sewer bills owed the District.\n\n\n        The trial court entered the requested judgment, but in advance of the tax sale the land-\nowners each separately petitioned the trial court objecting to their respective properties being\nlisted for tax sale and asserting that \"[a]ll property taxes are paid on this property and the only\namount due is an attached sewer lien.\" Appellant's App'x at 8\u20139. Further, the landowners each\nrequested, in part, that the trial court find that their respective properties \"[cannot] be sold at tax\nsale\" pursuant to Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4. Id. The District intervened and requested a\nhearing to determine whether the Ray or the Alford property ought to be removed from the tax\nsale list. Following the hearing, the trial court found that the only outstanding lien on either\nproperty was owed exclusively to the District for unpaid sewer bills and ordered that both prop-\nerties be removed from the 2013 tax sale because \"[the District] maintains the only lien\" and as\nsuch \"is precluded from foreclosing on the parcels pursuant to [Indiana Code section]\n13-26-14-4.\" Id. at 7. The District then initiated this appeal and petitioned this Court to accept\njurisdiction pursuant to Appellate Rule 56(A), which we granted.\n\n\n        All parties agree that the central issue in this case is the interpretation of the last sentence,\nthe lien foreclosure prohibition clause, in Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4. See Appellees' Br. at\n2; Appellant's Br. at 1. Section 4 is the last of four brief sections comprising Chapter 14. Sec-\ntion 1 authorizes regional sewer districts to use lien foreclosure to collect rates, charges, and\npenalties. Ind. Code \u00a7 13-26-14-1. Section 2 permits such lien foreclosure actions to recover the\nrates, charges, penalties, and reasonable attorney's fees and expressly directs a court-ordered sale\n\n                                                    2\n\f\"without relief from valuation or appraisement statutes.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 13-26-14-2. Section 3\nstates that the lien foreclosures are subject to \"the laws concerning municipal public improve-\nment assessments\" and the \"rights, remedies, procedure, and relief granted the parties to the ac-\ntion.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 13-26-14-3. Section 4, however, limits the availability of lien foreclosure in\ncertain circumstances. In its entirety, Section 4 states:\n        Sec. 4. Rates fees, or charges made, assessed, or established by the district are a lien, in\n        the same manner established under IC 36-9-23 for municipal sewage works, on a lot, par-\n        cel of land, or building that is connected with or uses the works of the district. Liens un-\n        der this chapter [chapter 14]:\n                 (1) attach;\n                 (2) are recorded;\n                 (3) are subject to the same penalties, interest, and reasonable attorney's fees on re-\n                 covery, and\n                 (4) shall be collected and enforced:\n        in substantially the same manner as provided in IC 36-9-23-31 through IC 36-9-23-34. A\n        lien under this chapter that is the only lien on a property may not be foreclosed.\nInd. Code \u00a7 13-26-14-4 (emphasis added). 1 Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of\nlaw and are reviewed de novo. Pinnacle Properties Dev. Grp., LLC v. City of Jeffersonville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"852425\"><a href=\"/opinion/852425/pinnacle-proper-v-city-of-jeffersonville/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 727 (Ind. 2008).\n\n\n        The District contends that the lien foreclosure prohibition clause in Section 4 does not\napply to tax sales, which are legally distinct from foreclosures under Indiana law. The District\nargues that a regional sewer district has three methods for collecting unpaid sewer bills and\npenalties 2 and that lien foreclosure is one of those methods. It argues that a foreclosure is a legal\nproceeding that \"terminates the owner's interest in property\" by selling the property itself and\ncutting off the owner's right of redemption, Appellant's Br. at 7, whereas a tax sale is a separate\navailable method of collection. Id. at 8. A tax sale \"does not terminate the rights of the owner\"\nand is not a sale of the real estate itself but rather a sale of a tax lien that \"is subject to a one year\n\n        1\n           The District's appeal also challenges the trial court's finding that the District was the only\nlienholder on the respective properties. In light of our resolution of the principal issue, this secondary\nclaim is not dispositive and will not be addressed.\n         2\n           The three methods of collection referred to by the District are: (1) the filing of a civil lawsuit\n(Indiana Code section 36-9-23-31); (2) the perfection and foreclosure of a lien on a customer's property\n(Indiana Code sections 36-9-23-34 and 13-26-14-1 et seq.); and (3) the certification of a lien to the county\nauditor for collection with property taxes (Indiana Code section 36-9-23-33). See Appellant's Br. at 5.\nThe landowners do not dispute the District's assertion that there are three methods by which a regional\nsewer district may collect delinquent bills and fees, but they argue that the prohibitive language in dispute\nin this case applies to both the second and third methods of collection.\n                                                     3\n\fperiod of redemption\" for the owner. Id. The District cites Indiana Code section 6-1.1-24-9(b),\nwhich provides that a tax sale purchaser has purchased \"a lien against the real property\" and not\nthe property itself, which practically and legally distinguishes a tax sale from a foreclosure. Id.\nThe District also urges that Indiana has a method for tax sale procedures that is found in Title 6\nof the Indiana Code and a separate method for the foreclosure of real estate that is found in Title\n32, and that the disputed language in this case, when read in context, mirrors the real estate fore-\nclosure language of Title 32 and not the tax sale language of Title 6. Id. at 12. Thus, the District\nargues that any prohibitive language for how collection may be conducted by a regional sewer\ndistrict under Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4 should only apply to the foreclosure method of\ncollection\u2014and not to the tax sale method of collection.\n\n\n       The landowners respond that the plain meaning of \"foreclosed\" in the last sentence ap-\nplies broadly to encompass both a traditional real estate foreclosure as well as a tax sale, which\nthey also refer to as a \"tax foreclosure.\" Appellees' Br. at 3.

Uhl, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 154, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ind.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (1891),\nthe landowners argue that Indiana has \"historically recognized tax sales as a foreclosure pro-\ncess.\" Appellees' Br. at 3.\n\n\n       The issue is thus whether the lien foreclosure prohibition clause in Section 4 applies to\nprohibit a tax sale when the sewer bill lien is the only lien on the property. The clause declares:\n\"A lien under this chapter that is the only lien on a property may not be foreclosed.\" Ind. Code\n\u00a7 13-26-14-4. The parties do not dispute that the landowners' respective delinquent fees and\npenalties constitute a proper lien under Section 4, but they disagree regarding whether the lien\nforeclosure prohibition clause applies to tax sales.\n\n\n       The statutory language in controversy, Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4, is part of Title\n13, Article 26, which applies to regional sewer districts. The counterpart statutory provisions\ngoverning municipal sewer works are found in Title 36, Article 9. We note that the disputed\nprohibition on lien foreclosure is introduced by the phrase \"[a] lien under this chapter [Chapter\n14 of Article 26].\" Id. We understand this to appropriately identify the prohibition as applying\nonly to the foreclosure of liens by regional sewer districts and not to restrict municipal sewer lien\n\n                                                  4\n\fforeclosures. In discussing the liens \"under this chapter [Chapter 14 of Article 26],\" Section 4\ndirects that such liens \"shall be collected and enforced . . . in substantially the same manner\" as\nprovided in Sections 31\u201334 of Title 36, Article 9, Chapter 23, which applies to municipal sewer\nfee collection. These four sections establish three methods of collection of delinquent sewer fees\nand penalties and expressly distinguish liens created by assessed sewer fees from tax liens. Sec-\ntion 31 generally authorizes the municipality to bring a civil action to collect delinquent sewer\nfees. Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-23-31 (2012). Section 32 provides that sewer fees assessed against real\nproperty under Chapter 23 \"constitute a lien against the property assessed,\" which lien is superior\nto \"all other liens except tax liens.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-23-32(a) (2012). Section 33 provides that\ndelinquent fees, penalties, and charges shall be collected by the county treasurer \"in the same\nway that delinquent property taxes are collected.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-23-33(i) (2012). Finally,\nSection 34 authorizes municipal sewer works to \"foreclose a lien established by this chapter in\norder to collect fees and penalties.\" Ind. Code \u00a7 36-9-23-34(a) (2012). In summary, these four\nsections of Chapter 23 explain how a municipality\u2014and by reference under Indiana Code sec-\ntion 13-26-14-4, a regional sewer district\u2014may collect unpaid and delinquent sewer bills. Sec-\ntion 31 authorizes the filing of a civil lawsuit, Section 32 declares that sewer fee assessments\nconstitute a lien on affected property and distinguishes such liens from \"tax liens,\" Section 33\nauthorizes collection through the delinquent property tax method, and Section 34 authorizes\nforeclosure of assessed sewer liens. And while Sections 31 through 34 expressly authorize the\ncounty treasurer to collect assessed sewer fees in the manner of collecting delinquent property\ntaxes, which includes resort to a tax sale, these sections do not define sewer fee collection liens\nas \"tax liens\" or refer to a \"tax sale\" as a \"lien foreclosure,\" nor does Chapter 23 elsewhere \"es-\ntablish\" a \"tax lien\" subject to \"foreclosure.\" We conclude that a tax sale does not fall within the\nregional sewer district lien foreclosure prohibition.\n\n\n       We are not persuaded by landowners' arguments to the contrary. While Black's Law Dic-\ntionary may be useful in some circumstances, its legal definitions do not supersede the general\nEnglish language chosen by the Indiana General Assembly in crafting our statutes. In addition,\nwe do not find relevant precedential value in this Court's 1891 decision in McCollum. At issue\nthere was whether notice had been satisfied in accordance with a statutory requirement and\nwhether a lien owed to the State for delinquent taxes was superior to a lien for a ditch assess-\n\n                                                  5\n\fment. 27 N.E. at 153\u2013154, 128 Ind. at 307\u201308. The passing mention of a \"tax foreclosure sale\"\nin McCollum was obiter dicta, not a holding requiring application to the present facts and statu-\ntory language. See 27 N.E. at 154, 128 Ind. at 308.\n\n\n       We recognize the landowners' earnest opposition to their property being subject to re-\ngional sewer district fees and their belief that the legislature's enactment of the lien foreclosure\nprohibition clause provided them with immunity in the absence of other liens. We must be guid-\ned, however, by the language enacted and thus find that, while it precludes the foreclosure of as-\nsessed regional sewer district fee liens when such liens are the only liens on a property, this pre-\nclusion does not extend to collection of such fees and charges by tax sale.\n\n\n                                             Conclusion\n\n\n       The lien foreclosure prohibition of Indiana Code section 13-26-14-4, governing the col-\nlection of regional sewer district sewer liens, does not apply to collection by tax sale. Here, be-\ncause the District employed the tax sale method and did not seek collection of the Appellees' un-\npaid sewer bills and penalties through the lien foreclosure method, the lien foreclosure prohibi-\ntion clause does not apply. The judgment of the trial court removing the Ray and Alford proper-\nties from the tax sale list is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings con-\nsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\nRush, C.J., Rucker, David, and Massa, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
