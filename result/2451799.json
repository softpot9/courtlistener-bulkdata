Gaines, Las Vegas, NV, Pro se.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER</i></h2>\n<p>HUVELLE, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs Joseph and Elizabeth Gaines filed a <i>pro se</i> complaint on December 5, 2005, alleging errors by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") \"in connection with the collection of [a] federal tax\" (Compl.\u015b 1), and seeking damages under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433. An amended complaint was filed on January 30, 2006 (\"Am. Compl.\"). For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' complaint and dismisses the case without prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*221</span> BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs' amended complaint alleges that \"[Weginning with `tax year' 1998 . . . officers, agents, and/or employees of the Internal Revenue Service, in connection with the collection of federal tax[,] recklessly, intentionally or by reason of negligence\" violated myriad provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and its accompanying regulations. (Am.Compl.\u015b7.) Plaintiffs sought damages for the alleged violations under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433. (Am.Compl.\u015b32.) Plaintiffs' case is one of dozens of virtually identical <i>pro se</i> complaints recently filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. At least two of these cases have previously been dismissed by this Court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction owing to plaintiffs' failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Henry v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477692\"><a href=\"/opinion/2477692/henry-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span> (D.D.C.2006); <i>Scott v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477500\"><a href=\"/opinion/2477500/scott-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">116</span></a></span> (D.D.C.2006). Therefore, on February 27, 2006, the Court ordered plaintiffs to show cause why jurisdiction over their claim was proper. <i>Gaines v. United States,</i> Order, 05-2326 (D.D.C. Feb. 27, 2006) (\"Show Cause Order\" or \"Order\"). As required for <i>pro se</i> litigants under <i>Fox v. Strickland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500341\"><a href=\"/opinion/500341/thomas-c-fox-v-marion-d-strickland/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1988), the Court informed plaintiffs that failure to respond could result in the Court dismissing the case. (Order at 2.) The Order instructed plaintiffs to explain how they had \"`exhausted all administrative remedies\" (Plaintiffs' Affidavit \u015b 16), as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(d)(1) and 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7433-1(a), (d), (e), and attach all documentation reflecting the filing of a claim as described in 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7433-1(e)(2). Plaintiffs filed a response to the Show Cause Order on March 14, 2006 (Response to Order to Show Cause (\"Pls.' Resp.\")), to which the IRS filed an opposition on March 29, 2006. (United States' Opposition to Plaintiffs' Response to the Court's Show-Cause Order (\"Def.'s Opp.\").) After reviewing the filings of both parties, the Court finds that it lacks jurisdiction because plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate compliance with the exhaustion requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that jurisdiction properly lies in this Court under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote>If, in connection with any collection of Federal tax with respect to a taxpayer, any officer or employee of the Internal Revenue Service recklessly or intentionally, or by reason of negligence disregards any provision of this title, or any regulation promulgated under this title, such taxpayer may bring a civil action for damages against the United States in a district court of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(a). With respect to exhaustion, the statute states that a \"judgment for damages shall not be awarded under [\u00a7 7433] unless the court determines that the plaintiff has exhausted the administrative remedies available to such plaintiff within the Internal Revenue Service.\" <i>Id.</i> \u00a7 7433(d)(1).</p>\n<p>The IRS has established by regulation the procedure by which a taxpayer may pursue a claim under section 7433. <i>See</i> 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7433-1. These regulations make clear that an \"action for damages filed in federal district court may not be maintained unless the taxpayer has filed an administrative claim pursuant to . . . this section.\" <i>Id.</i> \u00a7 301.7433-1(a). In order to properly file an administrative claim, a taxpayer must write to the \"Area Director, Attn: Compliance Technical Support Manager of the area in which the taxpayer currently resides.\" <i>Id.</i> \u00a7 301.7433-1(e)(1). The regulations spell <span class=\"star-pagination\">*222</span> out with specificity the information that must be provided to the Area Director, including, <i>inter alia,</i> the \"grounds, in reasonable detail, for the claim;\" a \"description of the injuries incurred;\" and the \"dollar amount of the claim, including any damages that have not yet been incurred but which are reasonably foreseeable.\" <i>Id.</i> \u00a7 301.7433-1(e)(2)(ii)\u00e2  (iv). The taxpayer is further required to provide any \"substantiating documentation\" supporting his claim. <i>Id.</i> A civil action in federal district court cannot be maintained until either the IRS rules on the claim, or six months pass without a decision by the IRS on a properly filed claim. <i>Id.</i> \u00a7 301.7433-1(d)(i)-(ii). Failure to comply with the regulation deprives the federal district court of jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Venen v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680714\"><a href=\"/opinion/680714/david-p-venen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 103 (3d Cir.1994); <i>McGuirl v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 128 (D.D.C.2004).</p>\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs do no more than assert that they \"may forego exhausting administrative remedies that are either futile or inadequate . . . or when agency action exceeds statutory authorization.\" (Compl.\u015b6.) Plaintiffs fail, however, to allege any facts that demonstrate futility or that the agency has exceeded its statutory authorization. <i>Cf. </i><i>Cooper v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3707403</span></span>, at *1 n. 2 (D.D.C.2005) (recognizing, in a virtually identical case ultimately dismissed for lack of venue, that plaintiffs failure to allege sufficient facts in support or to establish exhaustion doomed his \u00a7 7433 claim). Plaintiffs allege that they have \" exhausted administrative remedies in that [they have] written numerous requests for documents and authorities which require responses from the IRS,\" and that the \"IRS has failed and/or refused to respond or has responded with frivolous responses.\" (Compl.\u015b9.) As the IRS notes in its opposition, however, plaintiffs \"have not shown any attempt to comply with 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433's [exhaustion] requirement.\" (Def.'s Opp. at 4 n. 1.)</p>\n<p>Despite the Court's explicit directive to plaintiffs to explain how they have exhausted their administrative remedies and to provide \"all documentation reflecting the filing of a claim as described\" by the regulations (Show Cause Order at 2), plaintiffs' response to defendant's motion provides no additional detail beyond that which had already been included in their complaint. Rather, plaintiffs argue that the Court should exercise \"equity\" jurisdiction over their claim because \"the administrative `remedies' purportedly provided for\u00e2  as implemented by regulation\u00e2   are at best unavailable, and at worst, wholly inadequate.\" (Pls' Resp. at 6.) Plaintiffs' argument is without merit. Plaintiffs are not seeking an equitable remedy; they are seeking damages, which \"remain today a remedy at law.\" <i>Sparrow v. Comm'r,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572401\"><a href=\"/opinion/572401/cleveland-buchanan-sparrow-sr-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 437 (D.C.Cir.1991) (citing <i>Curtis v.

As such, an exercise of discretionary equity jurisdiction would be inappropriate.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Nor would it be appropriate for the court to waive the exhaustion requirement.

The first, known as \"nonjurisdictional exhaustion,\" is a \"judicially created doctrine\" that the court may, under certain circumstances and \"in its discretion, excuse.\" <i>Id.</i> The second, called <span class=\"star-pagination\">*223</span> \"jurisdictional exhaustion,\" is a statutory \"predicate to judicial review . . . rooted, not in prudential principles, but in Congress' power to control the jurisdiction of the federal courts.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>E.E.O.C. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (2000)). Because courts \"presume exhaustion is non-jurisdictional,\" <i>id.</i> at 1248, there must be \"[s]weeping and direct statutory language indicating that there is no federal jurisdiction prior to exhaustion, or the exhaustion requirement is treated as an element of the underlying claim.\" <i>Weinberger v. Salfi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109308\"><a href=\"/opinion/109308/weinberger-v-salfi/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span>, 757, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109308\"><a href=\"/opinion/109308/weinberger-v-salfi/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The relevant statute is unequivocal: a \"judgment for damages shall not be awarded under [section 7433] unless the court determines that the plaintiff has exhausted the administrative remedies available to such plaintiff within the Internal Revenue Service.\" 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433(d)(1). Several courts have \"interpreted the exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional\" in nature. <i>Bennett v.

Therefore, plaintiffs' failure to introduce any evidence that they attempted to or did comply with the procedures for bringing an administrative claim, as provided for in 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.7433-1, deprives the Court of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Even if the exhaustion requirement in this case were \"non-jurisdictional\" in nature, plaintiffs would fare no better. A non jurisdictional exhaustion requirement serves a variety of purposes.

The mere \"probability of administrative denial\" is insufficient to waive exhaustion. <i>Id.</i> at 106. Plaintiffs have introduced no evidence that the agency has a \"preconceived position on, or lacks jurisdiction over,\" their claim. <i>Id.</i> at 107.</p>\n<p>Nor have plaintiffs provided any evidence to support their claim that the administrative remedy is \"inadequate.\" (Pls.'
