Both\nsuspensions remain in effect.\n         {\u00b6 2} On April 11, 2011, relator, Columbus Bar Association, filed an\namended complaint2 alleging that while Squeo\u2019s license was under suspension, he\nengaged in the unauthorized practice of law by holding himself out as an\n\n\n1. The complaint erroneously identifies respondent as \u201cMarco Joseph Squeo,\u201d but accurately states\nthe attorney-registration number assigned to Mark Joseph Squeo.\n\n2. The original complaint is not in the record, but according to testimony by bar counsel, the first\namended complaint was identical to the original complaint, except that it corrected or clarified two\ndates in the original complaint.\n\f                                SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nattorney.3    Relator further alleged that Squeo had failed to cooperate in the\nresulting disciplinary investigation.\n        {\u00b6 3} Although Squeo filed a belated answer to relator\u2019s initial complaint\non October 27, 2011, he did not answer relator\u2019s January 9, 2012 second amended\ncomplaint, which broke Squeo\u2019s alleged misconduct down into two separate\ncounts and identified additional examples of his alleged failure to cooperate in\nrelator\u2019s investigation. He also failed to appear at the March 5, 2012 panel\nhearing.\n        {\u00b6 4} The panel issued a report making findings of fact and concluding\nthat Squeo had committed the charged misconduct.                     Citing the numerous\naggravating factors present in this case and the sanctions we have imposed for\ncomparable conduct, the panel recommended that Squeo be indefinitely\nsuspended from the practice of law. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of\nfact, conclusions of law, and recommended sanction.\n        {\u00b6 5} Like the board, we find that Squeo engaged in dishonesty, fraud,\ndeceit, or misrepresentation and in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration\nof justice by holding himself out as an attorney while his license was under\nsuspension and by failing to cooperate in the ensuing disciplinary investigation.\nWe also agree that an indefinite suspension is the proper sanction for his\nmisconduct.\n                                        Misconduct\n                 Count One: Squeo Held Himself Out as an Attorney\n                      While His License Was Under Suspension\n        {\u00b6 6} At the panel hearing, Kimberly Patrick testified that in early 2009,\nshe and her husband were driving in their vehicle when it was struck by another\n\n3. Relator charged Squeo with misconduct pursuant to applicable rules for acts occurring before\nand after February 1, 2007, the effective date of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which\nsuperseded the Code of Professional Responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nvehicle. At the scene of the accident, the passenger of the other vehicle identified\nhimself as Marco Squeo and stated that the minor who was driving was his son.\nSqueo advised the Patricks that he was insured, but asked them not to call the\npolice, stating that he preferred to pay for their damages himself. To bolster his\ncredibility, he advised them that he was a lawyer and handed them a business card\nfor Squeo Companies, L.L.C., with a Galloway, Ohio address, bearing the name\nMarco J. Squeo, Esq., and identifying him as an attorney at law. On the back of\nthe card, he wrote the make and model of his car, the license-plate number, and\n\u201cState Farm,\u201d followed by a policy number.\n       {\u00b6 7} Squeo did not respond to the Patricks\u2019 numerous attempts to reach\nhim following the accident. The Patricks discovered, however, that Squeo did not\nhave insurance through State Farm and that the insurance information that Squeo\nhad given them at the scene of the accident was not his but instead was his ex-\nwife\u2019s. Kimberly Patrick testified that State Farm told her that the minor who had\nbeen driving Squeo\u2019s vehicle was not his son, as he had claimed, but was actually\nhis nephew. The Patricks eventually reported the accident to the local police\ndepartment and their own insurance company, and their insurer paid their claim\nand sought restitution from Squeo.\n       {\u00b6 8} Based upon Squeo\u2019s conduct in the Patrick matter, the board\ndetermined that he had violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.5 (prohibiting a lawyer who is not\nadmitted to practice in this jurisdiction from representing that he is admitted to\npractice in this jurisdiction), 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in\nconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(h)\n(prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the\nlawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).\n       {\u00b6 9} In addition, based upon three documents executed and filed with\nthe Franklin County recorder in January and February 2004, all of which bear the\nnotation \u201cThis instrument was prepared by MARK J. SQUEO, ATTORNEY AT\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nLAW\u201d (capitalization sic), the panel and board determined that Squeo had\nengaged in the practice of law while his license was under suspension. The first\nof those documents is a special power of attorney appointing Squeo as attorney-\nin-fact to purchase certain real property on behalf of Kim W. Jackson and Janette\nP. Jackson, who executed the document on January 21, 2004. That document was\nfiled with the Franklin County recorder on February 5, 2004.                       The second\ndocument is a special power of attorney appointing Squeo to convey certain real\nproperty on behalf of Collis H. Davis and Violeta P. Hughes. Davis and Hughes\nexecuted the document on January 7, 2004, and the document was filed with the\nFranklin County recorder on January 22, 2004.                    The third document is a\nsurvivorship deed executed by Mark J. Squeo for Collis H. Davis and Violeta P.\nHughes on January 15, 2004, to transfer certain real property on their behalf.\nThat document was filed with the Franklin County recorder on January 22, 2004.4\n        {\u00b6 10} Based upon these documents, the board found that Squeo had\nviolated DR 3-101(B) (prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction\nin violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction), 1-\n102(A)(4) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,\nfraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from\nengaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice\nlaw).\n        {\u00b6 11} We adopt these findings of fact and misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n4. The board also found that the webpage of HER Real Living realtors Jim and Tara Thomas\nidentified Squeo as the closing attorney for their real estate firm and that in a letter to an\ninsurance-claims representative dated July 13, 2009, Squeo purported to represent clients\nregarding an insurance claim. The documents that they cite to support these findings, however,\nare not in evidence, because relator withdrew them at the panel hearing. We therefore reject these\nfindings of fact.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                                     January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n                     Count Two: Squeo Failed to Cooperate in the\n                           Resulting Disciplinary Investigation\n        {\u00b6 12} Bar counsel, Bruce Campbell, testified that relator sent numerous\nletters to Squeo at the addresses that he had registered with the Office of Attorney\nServices and to the Galloway address on the business card that Squeo had given to\nthe Patricks on the day of the accident, but that a number of them were returned\nmarked unclaimed. In January 2010, relator sent a notice of deposition to Squeo\nby certified and regular mail. Although someone at the Galloway address signed\nfor the certified letter, Squeo failed to appear for his deposition.\n        {\u00b6 13} When attempts to serve relator\u2019s complaint on Squeo by certified\nmail failed, the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline served the\ncomplaint on the clerk of the Supreme Court pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(11)(B).\n        {\u00b6 14} Because Squeo failed to timely file an answer, relator prepared a\ndefault motion, but Campbell wanted to talk to Squeo before filing it. He went to\nSqueo\u2019s registered address, where he spoke with some neighbors and discovered\nthat Squeo had not lived at that address in several years. He then went to the\nGalloway address and found Squeo in the yard. Squeo acknowledged that he had\nreceived some mailings from relator, but stated that he had not bothered to open\nthem, because he was not practicing law and thus did not feel that he had any\nresponsibility to the bar association. Following that meeting, Squeo filed an\nanswer to the original complaint.              But he did not appear for a scheduled\ndeposition, despite the fact that a subpoena was served on someone at the\nGalloway address.\n        {\u00b6 15} Squeo was served with relator\u2019s second amended complaint by\nregular mail,5 but he did not answer it. Squeo did not participate in a telephone\n\n\n5. The board found that Squeo was served with the second amended complaint by certified mail,\nbut the record demonstrates that the certified-mail service attempted by both relator and the board\nfailed. The certificate of service attached to the second amended complaint, however, states that\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nprehearing conference on February 3, 2012, even though the panel chair had\ncontinued the conference for Squeo\u2019s convenience. And although Squeo received\nnotice of the time and place of the evidentiary hearing, he did not appear.\n        {\u00b6 16} The board found, and we agree, that this conduct violated\nProf.Cond.R. 8.1(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly failing to respond to a\ndemand for information by a disciplinary authority during an investigation),\n8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice), and 8.4(h).\n                                           Sanction\n        {\u00b6 17} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider\nrelevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the\nsanctions imposed in similar cases.

In making a final\ndetermination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors\nlisted in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, 115 Ohio\nSt.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 21.\n        {\u00b6 18} The board found that seven of the nine aggravating factors set forth\nin BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1) are present: (1) a prior disciplinary record, (2) a\nselfish or dishonest motive, (3) a pattern of misconduct, (4) multiple offenses, (5)\nfailure to cooperate in the disciplinary process, (6) vulnerability of and resulting\nharm to victims of the misconduct, and (7) failure to make restitution. BCGD\nProc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (i).               The board found no\nmitigating factors. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2). We agree with these findings.\n\nrelator mailed the document to Squeo by certified and regular mail on January 9, 2012. Gov.Bar\nR. V(11)(D) requires only that the party affected by an amendment to a complaint be given a\nreasonable opportunity to meet any new matter presented. And Civ.R. 5(B) provides that service\nof pleadings and other papers subsequent to the original complaint may be accomplished by mail\nto the last known address of the person to be served and provides that service by mail is complete\nupon mailing. Therefore, we find that Squeo was served with the second amended complaint, but\nnot by certified mail.\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Relator requests and the board recommends that Squeo be\nindefinitely suspended from the practice of law. In support of this sanction, they\nnote our holding that neglect of legal matters coupled with a failure to cooperate\nin the ensuing disciplinary investigation generally warrants an indefinite\nsuspension. See, e.g., Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. Kaplan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n2010-Ohio-167, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \u00b6 15.\n       {\u00b6 20} Although Squeo has not been found to have neglected client\nmatters, he held himself out as an attorney while his license to practice law was\nsuspended, gave the Patricks false insurance information, and falsely stated his\nintention to personally pay for the damage to their vehicle, all to convince them\nthat they should not report the auto accident to the police. Moreover, he failed to\ncooperate in the resulting disciplinary investigation. His actions were prejudicial\nto the administration of justice and adversely reflect on his fitness to practice law.\nAs the panel and board found, on the evidence before us, \u201cwe can only conclude\nthat his conduct demonstrates dishonesty, perversity, and recalcitrance.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 21} We have imposed an indefinite suspension for comparable\nmisconduct in the past. See, e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Mitchell, 124 Ohio\nSt.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-135, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (imposing an indefinite suspension on\nan attorney who attempted to deceive a juvenile court magistrate as to his identity\nand the status of his license to practice law while under an attorney-registration\nsuspension), and Disciplinary Counsel v.

Therefore, we hold\nthat an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction for Squeo\u2019s misconduct.\n       {\u00b6 22} Accordingly, Mark Joseph Squeo is indefinitely suspended from\nthe practice of law in Ohio.

Relator charged Squeo with misconduct pursuant to applicable rules for acts occurring before\nand after February 1, 2007, the effective date of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which\nsuperseded the Code of Professional Responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\nvehicle. At the scene of the accident, the passenger of the other vehicle identified\nhimself as Marco Squeo and stated that the minor who was driving was his son.\nSqueo advised the Patricks that he was insured, but asked them not to call the\npolice, stating that he preferred to pay for their damages himself. To bolster his\ncredibility, he advised them that he was a lawyer and handed them a business card\nfor Squeo Companies, L.L.C., with a Galloway, Ohio address, bearing the name\nMarco J. Squeo, Esq., and identifying him as an attorney at law. On the back of\nthe card, he wrote the make and model of his car, the license-plate number, and\n\u201cState Farm,\u201d followed by a policy number.\n       {\u00b6 7} Squeo did not respond to the Patricks\u2019 numerous attempts to reach\nhim following the accident. The Patricks discovered, however, that Squeo did not\nhave insurance through State Farm and that the insurance information that Squeo\nhad given them at the scene of the accident was not his but instead was his ex-\nwife\u2019s. Kimberly Patrick testified that State Farm told her that the minor who had\nbeen driving Squeo\u2019s vehicle was not his son, as he had claimed, but was actually\nhis nephew. The Patricks eventually reported the accident to the local police\ndepartment and their own insurance company, and their insurer paid their claim\nand sought restitution from Squeo.\n       {\u00b6 8} Based upon Squeo\u2019s conduct in the Patrick matter, the board\ndetermined that he had violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.5 (prohibiting a lawyer who is not\nadmitted to practice in this jurisdiction from representing that he is admitted to\npractice in this jurisdiction), 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in\nconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(h)\n(prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the\nlawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).\n       {\u00b6 9} In addition, based upon three documents executed and filed with\nthe Franklin County recorder in January and February 2004, all of which bear the\nnotation \u201cThis instrument was prepared by MARK J. SQUEO, ATTORNEY AT\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nLAW\u201d (capitalization sic), the panel and board determined that Squeo had\nengaged in the practice of law while his license was under suspension. The first\nof those documents is a special power of attorney appointing Squeo as attorney-\nin-fact to purchase certain real property on behalf of Kim W. Jackson and Janette\nP. Jackson, who executed the document on January 21, 2004. That document was\nfiled with the Franklin County recorder on February 5, 2004.                       The second\ndocument is a special power of attorney appointing Squeo to convey certain real\nproperty on behalf of Collis H. Davis and Violeta P. Hughes. Davis and Hughes\nexecuted the document on January 7, 2004, and the document was filed with the\nFranklin County recorder on January 22, 2004.                    The third document is a\nsurvivorship deed executed by Mark J. Squeo for Collis H. Davis and Violeta P.\nHughes on January 15, 2004, to transfer certain real property on their behalf.\nThat document was filed with the Franklin County recorder on January 22, 2004.4\n        {\u00b6 10} Based upon these documents, the board found that Squeo had\nviolated DR 3-101(B) (prohibiting a lawyer from practicing law in a jurisdiction\nin violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction), 1-\n102(A)(4) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,\nfraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from\nengaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice\nlaw).\n        {\u00b6 11} We adopt these findings of fact and misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n4. The board also found that the webpage of HER Real Living realtors Jim and Tara Thomas\nidentified Squeo as the closing attorney for their real estate firm and that in a letter to an\ninsurance-claims representative dated July 13, 2009, Squeo purported to represent clients\nregarding an insurance claim. The documents that they cite to support these findings, however,\nare not in evidence, because relator withdrew them at the panel hearing. We therefore reject these\nfindings of fact.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                                     January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n                     Count Two: Squeo Failed to Cooperate in the\n                           Resulting Disciplinary Investigation\n        {\u00b6 12} Bar counsel, Bruce Campbell, testified that relator sent numerous\nletters to Squeo at the addresses that he had registered with the Office of Attorney\nServices and to the Galloway address on the business card that Squeo had given to\nthe Patricks on the day of the accident, but that a number of them were returned\nmarked unclaimed. In January 2010, relator sent a notice of deposition to Squeo\nby certified and regular mail. Although someone at the Galloway address signed\nfor the certified letter, Squeo failed to appear for his deposition.\n        {\u00b6 13} When attempts to serve relator\u2019s complaint on Squeo by certified\nmail failed, the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline served the\ncomplaint on the clerk of the Supreme Court pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(11)(B).\n        {\u00b6 14} Because Squeo failed to timely file an answer, relator prepared a\ndefault motion, but Campbell wanted to talk to Squeo before filing it. He went to\nSqueo\u2019s registered address, where he spoke with some neighbors and discovered\nthat Squeo had not lived at that address in several years. He then went to the\nGalloway address and found Squeo in the yard. Squeo acknowledged that he had\nreceived some mailings from relator, but stated that he had not bothered to open\nthem, because he was not practicing law and thus did not feel that he had any\nresponsibility to the bar association. Following that meeting, Squeo filed an\nanswer to the original complaint.              But he did not appear for a scheduled\ndeposition, despite the fact that a subpoena was served on someone at the\nGalloway address.\n        {\u00b6 15} Squeo was served with relator\u2019s second amended complaint by\nregular mail,5 but he did not answer it. Squeo did not participate in a telephone\n\n\n5. The board found that Squeo was served with the second amended complaint by certified mail,\nbut the record demonstrates that the certified-mail service attempted by both relator and the board\nfailed. The certificate of service attached to the second amended complaint, however, states that\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f                                 SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nprehearing conference on February 3, 2012, even though the panel chair had\ncontinued the conference for Squeo\u2019s convenience. And although Squeo received\nnotice of the time and place of the evidentiary hearing, he did not appear.\n        {\u00b6 16} The board found, and we agree, that this conduct violated\nProf.Cond.R. 8.1(b) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly failing to respond to a\ndemand for information by a disciplinary authority during an investigation),\n8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the\nadministration of justice), and 8.4(h).\n                                           Sanction\n        {\u00b6 17} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider\nrelevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the\nsanctions imposed in similar cases. Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, 96 Ohio\nSt.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16.                         In making a final\ndetermination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors\nlisted in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B). Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, 115 Ohio\nSt.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.\n        {\u00b6 18} The board found that seven of the nine aggravating factors set forth\nin BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1) are present: (1) a prior disciplinary record, (2) a\nselfish or dishonest motive, (3) a pattern of misconduct, (4) multiple offenses, (5)\nfailure to cooperate in the disciplinary process, (6) vulnerability of and resulting\nharm to victims of the misconduct, and (7) failure to make restitution. BCGD\nProc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (i).               The board found no\nmitigating factors. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2). We agree with these findings.\n\nrelator mailed the document to Squeo by certified and regular mail on January 9, 2012. Gov.Bar\nR. V(11)(D) requires only that the party affected by an amendment to a complaint be given a\nreasonable opportunity to meet any new matter presented. And Civ.R. 5(B) provides that service\nof pleadings and other papers subsequent to the original complaint may be accomplished by mail\nto the last known address of the person to be served and provides that service by mail is complete\nupon mailing. Therefore, we find that Squeo was served with the second amended complaint, but\nnot by certified mail.\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f                                January Term, 2012\n\n\n\n\n       {\u00b6 19} Relator requests and the board recommends that Squeo be\nindefinitely suspended from the practice of law. In support of this sanction, they\nnote our holding that neglect of legal matters coupled with a failure to cooperate\nin the ensuing disciplinary investigation generally warrants an indefinite\nsuspension. See, e.g., Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. Kaplan, 124 Ohio St.3d 278,\n2010-Ohio-167, 921 N.E.2d 645, \u00b6 15.\n       {\u00b6 20} Although Squeo has not been found to have neglected client\nmatters, he held himself out as an attorney while his license to practice law was\nsuspended, gave the Patricks false insurance information, and falsely stated his\nintention to personally pay for the damage to their vehicle, all to convince them\nthat they should not report the auto accident to the police. Moreover, he failed to\ncooperate in the resulting disciplinary investigation. His actions were prejudicial\nto the administration of justice and adversely reflect on his fitness to practice law.\nAs the panel and board found, on the evidence before us, \u201cwe can only conclude\nthat his conduct demonstrates dishonesty, perversity, and recalcitrance.\u201d\n       {\u00b6 21} We have imposed an indefinite suspension for comparable\nmisconduct in the past. See, e.g., Disciplinary Counsel v. Mitchell, 124 Ohio\nSt.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-135, 921 N.E.2d 634 (imposing an indefinite suspension on\nan attorney who attempted to deceive a juvenile court magistrate as to his identity\nand the status of his license to practice law while under an attorney-registration\nsuspension), and Disciplinary Counsel v. Freeman, 126 Ohio St.3d 389, 2010-\nOhio-3824, 934 N.E.2d 328, \u00b6 14 (recognizing that we have routinely imposed\nindefinite suspensions on attorneys who continued to practice law after we have\nsuspended their licenses for CLE and registration violations). Therefore, we hold\nthat an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction for Squeo\u2019s misconduct.\n       {\u00b6 22} Accordingly, Mark Joseph Squeo is indefinitely suspended from\nthe practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to Squeo.\n                                                              Judgment accordingly.\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                          SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       O\u2019CONNOR, C.J., and PFEIFER, LUNDBERG STRATTON, O\u2019DONNELL,\nLANZINGER, CUPP, and MCGEE BROWN, JJ., concur.\n                            __________________\n       Yvonne L.
