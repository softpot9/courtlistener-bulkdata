After\ncontinuances in the juvenile court to permit further filings concerning appropriate\nmodifications of the dispositional order, on May 4, 2012, the juvenile court entered an\namended dispositional order committing minor \u201cto Juvenile Hall of Stanislaus County\nuntil he reaches the age of 21 with housing at the Division of Juvenile Facilities\u201d\npursuant to section 1752.16. The juvenile court also stated: \u201c[Minor] is to complete sex\noffender counseling at the Division of Juvenile Facilities in which he was previously\nenrolled and participating.

A commitment to DJF and a commitment to juvenile hall with\nhousing at DJF are distinctly different orders with different results. First, a ward\ncommitted to DJF who has committed any of the wide variety of sex crimes listed in\nPenal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), is required to register as a sex offender\npursuant to Penal Code section 290, subdivision (b). (See id., \u00a7 290.008, subd. (a).)\nThere is no similar requirement for wards committed to juvenile hall for the same sexual\noffenses.

Second, after a ward is\ncommitted to DJF, the decision to release the ward from custody resides with the Juvenile\nParole Board, not with the juvenile court that made the commitment.

By contrast\u2014and as shown in the\njuvenile court\u201fs order from which this appeal is taken\u2014the decision concerning release of\nthe ward from custody remains with the juvenile court judge. These two factors\ndemonstrate that such a housing order is not merely a semantically different authorization\nof the same punishment declared impermissible in In re C.H.4\n       Minor also contends a housing order pursuant to section 1752.16 violates the stare\ndecisis concepts articulated in Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v.

(\u201cThe decisions of this court are binding upon and must be followed by all the state\ncourts of California.\u201d (Id. at p. 455.))

That case did not hold that wards who committed Penal Code\nsection 290.008, subdivision (c), crimes could not constitutionally be committed to DJF.\nIn re C.H. simply held that the Legislature had not authorized such commitments under\nthe statutes then existing. The Supreme Court expressly stated: \u201c[T]he Legislature is\nfree to reconsider the policy set out in the current statutes if it wishes to do so.\u201d (53\nCal.4th at p. 108.) It is clear that the Legislature has done so. For new offenses, Statutes\n2012, chapter 7, section 1, amends section 731, subdivision (a) to expand the list of\noffenses for which a ward can be committed to DJF to include the offenses listed in Penal\nCode section 290.008, subdivision (c). For persons such as minor, section 3 of chapter 7\ncreates section 1752.16, specifically permitting the type of housing order employed in the\npresent case. (See Stats. 2012, ch. 7, \u00a7 3.) In both instances there is now statutory\n\n4      In this case, the juvenile court expressed its concern that a housing order under\nsection 1752.16 might be used to justify incarceration of minor at DJF without providing\nthe services of the sexual offender program.

The new statute fully satisfies the\nrequirements of In re C.H., and actions taken under it do not violate the doctrine of Auto\nEquity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       Minor next contends the juvenile court lacks statutory authority to authorize\nhousing at DJF because no such dispositional alternative is available under sections 202\nand 727. Section 202, subdivision (e)(4), authorizes the court to commit a ward to\njuvenile hall. As with all dispositional orders on section 602 petitions, wards \u201cshall, in\nconformity with the interests of public safety and protection, receive care, treatment, and\nguidance that is consistent with their best interest, that holds them accountable for their\nbehavior, and that is appropriate for their circumstances.\u201d (\u00a7 202, subd. (b).) \u201cIf a minor\nis adjudged a ward of the court on the ground that he or she is a person described by\nSection 601 or 602 the court may make any reasonable orders for the care, supervision,\ncustody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the minor, including medical treatment\n\u2026.\u201d (\u00a7 727, subd. (a).) Section 731, subdivision (a)(3), permits the court to order a ward\nto \u201cparticipate in a program of professional counseling as arranged and directed by the\nprobation officer as a condition of continued custody of the ward.\u201d The sexual offender\nprogram offered by DJF pursuant to section 1752.16 is merely another treatment\nalternative available to counties, and an order that a ward receive treatment through such\na program is fully authorized by sections 202, 727, and 731. The juvenile court had\nauthority to direct that the probation officer seek placement of minor in the DJF sexual\noffender program.5\n\n5      The written order in this case might be construed as ordering DJF to house minor\nduring his commitment to juvenile hall. However, the juvenile court did not order joinder\nof DJF as a party pursuant to section 727, former subdivision (a) (the statute was\namended effective Jan. 1, 2013), and, as a result, had \u201cno authority to order services\u201d\nfrom the agency. (Ibid.; see Stats. 2012, ch. 130, \u00a7 2.) It is clear from the transcript of\noral proceedings that the court, in essence, merely authorized the probation officer to\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f       Minor contends that, to the extent the statutory scheme permits the juvenile court\nto order his participation in the DJF sexual offender program, it violates the equal\nprotection guarantees of the federal and state Constitutions. (See U.S. Const., 14th\namend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7.) He says section 1752.16, because it permits, but does not\nrequire, individual counties to contract with DJF for housing of participants in the sexual\noffender program, \u201cviolates equal protection because similarly situated wards could be\ntreated differently based simply on their county of commitment, i.e., as to whether or not\nthe county had entered into a contract with the D.J.F.\u201d Minor cites no legal authority in\nsupport of this argument, and we are aware of no authority requiring uniformity of county\nrehabilitation resources. The juvenile court in each county considers all available\nresources in making the dispositional order in any particular case. (See, e.g., \u00a7 730,\nsubd. (a).) A county with a local sexual offender program at its juvenile facility might be\nless likely to enter into a section 1752.16 contract with DJF, just as a juvenile court in\nsuch a county might exercise its discretion differently than would a juvenile court with no\nsuch local resources. Individual exercises of discretion by prosecutors and judges do not\nprovide a basis for an equal protection challenge unless the discretion involves \u201cinvidious\ndiscrimination\u201d or \u201cvindictive or retaliatory\u201d reasoning. (Manduley v. Superior Court\n(2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600810\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600810/manduley-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 569-571 [prosecutor\u201fs charging discretion under \u00a7 707,\nsubd. (d)].) The Legislature\u201fs decision to provide an additional rehabilitation alternative\nto those counties in need of such a program does not violate the equal protection rights of\npersons in such counties that accept such an offer.\n       Minor contends the dispositional order in this case impermissibly intermingles the\nresponsibilities of the probation department and the responsibilities of DJF. He contends\n\n\nseek housing at DJF for the purpose of minor\u201fs participation in the sexual offender\nprogram during the time minor was otherwise in juvenile hall; the court did not purport to\norder DJF to accept minor into the program.\n\n\n\n                                              7.\n\fthe joint responsibility that results is unprecedented, unauthorized by the Welfare and\nInstitutions Code, and unconstitutionally vague. It is clear from the statutory scheme,\nhowever, that the juvenile court retains supervision and control over a minor. That\nsupervision and control is not altered by the minor\u201fs participation in the DJF sexual\noffender program. Unquestionably, a ward placed in a foster home, a residential\ntreatment program, or juvenile hall (or an older ward housed in the county jail under\n\u00a7 208.5) is answerable on a daily basis to those who operate the program, but that does\nnot change the ultimate responsibility of the juvenile court for the ward\u201fs supervision and\ncontrol. (See \u00a7 727, subd. (a).) Similarly, when a ward is committed to juvenile hall\npursuant to section 202, subdivision (e)(4), and housed at DJF pursuant to\nsection 1752.16, the juvenile court retains ultimate responsibility for supervision and\ncontrol. The responsibility of a service provider, in this case DJF, for the day-to-day\noperation of the program for wards, with ultimate supervision and control in the juvenile\ncourt, is not unprecedented; it is, as stated, the same as a myriad of placements of wards\nunder the Welfare and Institutions Code. The supervisory relationship is authorized by\nsections 727, subdivision (a) and 1752.16, and that relationship does not result in an\nunconstitutionally vague order: The juvenile court clearly ordered that minor\n\u201csuccessful[ly] complet[e]\u201d DJF\u201fs sexual offender program. The court clearly has the\nretained jurisdiction to determine whether minor has done so.\n       Minor next contends section 1752.16 is an unconstitutional ex post facto law.\n(See U.S. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 10; Cal. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 9.) The state and federal ex post facto\nlaws have the same meaning. (John L. v. Superior Court (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2509094\"><a href=\"/opinion/2509094/john-l-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171-\n172.) \u201c[N]o statute falls within the ex post facto prohibition unless \u201etwo critical\nelements\u201f exist.\u201d (Id. at p. 172.) \u201cFirst, the law must be retroactive.\u201d (Ibid.)\nSection 1752.16 is applicable to minor solely because he was, prior to the effective date\nof that section, the subject of a section 602 petition charging a crime listed in Penal Code\nsection 290.008, subdivision (c), and was serving a commitment to DJF on the date In re\n\n                                              8.\n\fC.H., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844236\"><a href=\"/opinion/844236/in-re-ch/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> was decided. Accordingly, the first requirement for a\nprohibited ex post facto law is met.\n       The second requirement for a prohibited ex post facto law is that the law must\nhave one or more of the following four effects: it makes criminal acts that were innocent\nwhen done; it makes the crime greater or more aggravated than it was when committed; it\ninflicts a greater punishment for the crime than was available when the crime was\ncommitted; or it alters the rules of evidence or the required proof for conviction. (John\nL., supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 172 & fn. 3.)\n       Minor contends section 1752.16 violates the third of these prohibitions; that is, he\ncontends section 1752.16 increases the punishment that could have been imposed upon\nhim at the time he committed his section 602 offense. This contention is without merit.\nBoth before and after the enactment of section 1752.16, a ward could be confined in a\nvariety of juvenile institutions run by the county (\u00a7 730, subd. (a)) and could be ordered\nto \u201cparticipate in a program of professional counseling as arranged and directed by the\nprobation officer as a condition of continued custody of the ward.\u201d (\u00a7 731, subd. (a)(3).)\nThe mere fact that the state created an additional resource to provide sexual offender\ntreatment, and that this resource was in a different location than the existing local\nprograms, does not constitute an increase in the punishment authorized for purposes of\nthe ex post facto clauses. (See People v. Cruz (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672, fn. 8\n[serving sentence locally is not lesser punishment than serving same length sentence in\nstate prison for ex post facto purposes].)\n       In addition, for wards of minor\u201fs age, section 208.5, both before and after the\nenactment of section 1752.16, permitted a ward who is committed to juvenile hall to be\nhoused in the county jail. (See In re Ramon M. (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260124\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260124/in-re-ramon-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Second, minor contends the juvenile\ncourt erred by continuing minor \u201con probation\u201d and erred in attempting to \u201cretain[]\njurisdiction\u201d to impose conditions of probation at a later date. In fact, however, minor\nwas continued as a ward of the juvenile court and was committed to juvenile hall until his\n21st birthday. He was conditionally authorized to be housed at DJF until he completed\nthe sexual offender program.

(2011) 53 Cal.4th 94, and is\nan abuse of the juvenile court\u201fs discretion. We disagree and affirm.\n                                        HISTORY\n       On January 25, 2010, approximately one month after his 17th birthday, minor\ndisrobed his three-year-old sister and placed his finger in her vagina. Minor entered a no-\ncontest admission to a section 602 petition that alleged one count of violation of Penal\nCode section 288, subdivision (a) (lewd or lascivious act on a child under 14), and one\ncount of violation of Penal Code section 289, subdivision (j) (sexual penetration of a\nchild under 14 and more than 10 years younger than the perpetrator). At the dispositional\nhearing on April 13, 2010, the juvenile court declared minor a ward of the court and\ncommitted him to DJF, with a maximum commitment of 96 months. This court affirmed\nthe commitment order on appeal. (In re Robert M. (Jan. 28, 2011, F060094).) The\nSupreme Court granted review.\n       In December 2011, the Supreme Court held, in In re C.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th 94,\nthat a juvenile court may only commit a ward to DJF \u201cif the ward \u2026 committed an\noffense listed in section 707[, subdivision] (b) and then only if the ward\u201fs most recent\noffense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the juvenile court is\neither an offense enumerated under section 707[, subdivision] (b) or a sex offense\n\n\n\n\n1     All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless\notherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n                                             2.\n\fdescribed in Penal Code section 290.008[, subdivision] (c).\u201d (Id. at p. 108.)2\n       In February 2012, the Supreme Court transferred minor\u201fs case to this court with\ndirections to reconsider the cause in light of the decision in In re C.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th\n94. On remand, this court reversed the juvenile court\u201fs order committing minor to DJF\nand remanded the matter to the juvenile court for further proceedings. (In re Robert M.\n(Mar. 23, 2012, F060094).)3\n       In June 2012, section 1752.16 was enacted as urgency legislation \u201cto address the\nCalifornia Supreme Court\u201fs ruling in In re C.H. (2011) 53 Cal.4th 94.\u201d (Id., subd. (b).)\nSection 1752.16, subdivision (a), provides that DJF \u201cmay enter into contracts with any\ncounty of this state for [DJF] to furnish housing to a ward who was in the custody\u201d of\nDJF on the date In re C.H. was decided (Dec. 12, 2011) and who was committed to DJF\nfor the commission of an offense listed in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c),\n\n\n2      Section 707, subdivision (b), lists 30 serious and violent crimes which, when\ncommitted by a minor 14 years of age or older, permit proceedings to determine whether\nthe minor should be tried as an adult for the offense. (Other related provisions require\nprosecution as an adult in some circumstances not relevant to the present case. (See In re\nEddie M. (2003) 31 Cal.4th 480, 487, fn. 3.)) Section 707, subdivision (b), serves an\nadditional purpose, however: section 731, subdivision (a)(4), at the time of minor\u201fs\noffense, provided that a minor adjudged a ward pursuant to section 602 could be\ncommitted to DJF only if the minor had committed an offense described in section 707,\nsubdivision (b). While forcible lewd or lascivious conduct, described in Penal Code\nsection 288, subdivision (b), is listed in section 707, subdivision (b), nonforcible lewd or\nlascivious conduct, proscribed by Penal Code section 288, subdivision (a), is not. (See In\nre C.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th at p. 99, fn. 3.) Nor are nonforcible Penal Code section 289\noffenses listed in section 707, subdivision (b).\n        Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), contains a different listing of crimes.\nSubdivision (a) of that statute requires that any person who is discharged after he or she\nhas been committed to DJF based on a section 602 petition alleging any of the offenses\nlisted in Penal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), shall register as a sex offender. All\nviolations of Penal Code section 288 are included in the Penal Code section 290.008,\nsubdivision (c) list, as are all violations of Penal Code section 289.\n3      We grant minor\u201fs request that we take judicial notice of the record in F060094.\n\n\n\n                                             3.\n\fbut who had not committed an offense listed in section 707, subdivision (b). After\ncontinuances in the juvenile court to permit further filings concerning appropriate\nmodifications of the dispositional order, on May 4, 2012, the juvenile court entered an\namended dispositional order committing minor \u201cto Juvenile Hall of Stanislaus County\nuntil he reaches the age of 21 with housing at the Division of Juvenile Facilities\u201d\npursuant to section 1752.16. The juvenile court also stated: \u201c[Minor] is to complete sex\noffender counseling at the Division of Juvenile Facilities in which he was previously\nenrolled and participating. And upon completion of that sex offender counseling, he is to\nbe returned to the Stanislaus County Juvenile Court for possible modification of his\nsentence.\u201d\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       Minor agrees he is a person described in section 1752.16, but contends, first, that\nsection 1752.16 and the order for housing entered in this case are merely \u201ca transparent\nprocedural subterfuge\u201d to avoid the holding of In re C.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th 94, and, as\nsuch, the statute and the order \u201cthreaten[] to demean the integrity of the entire judicial\nprocess.\u201d We disagree. A commitment to DJF and a commitment to juvenile hall with\nhousing at DJF are distinctly different orders with different results. First, a ward\ncommitted to DJF who has committed any of the wide variety of sex crimes listed in\nPenal Code section 290.008, subdivision (c), is required to register as a sex offender\npursuant to Penal Code section 290, subdivision (b). (See id., \u00a7 290.008, subd. (a).)\nThere is no similar requirement for wards committed to juvenile hall for the same sexual\noffenses. (See In re Crockett (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 751, 760 [Court accepted\nrespondent\u201fs concession that \u201c\u201e[j]uveniles adjudicated in California must register for a\nlist of more serious sex offenses, and petitioner\u201fs offenses are among those requiring\nregistration in California\u2026. However, registration for one of the listed offenses is\nrequired only if the juvenile was also incarcerated at the California Youth Authority, now\nthe Division of Juvenile Justice \u2026 (DJJ).\u201f\u201d]; see also In re Bernardino S. (1992) 4\n\n                                              4.\n\fCal.App.4th 613, 619-620 [former Pen. Code, \u00a7 290, subd. (d)].) Second, after a ward is\ncommitted to DJF, the decision to release the ward from custody resides with the Juvenile\nParole Board, not with the juvenile court that made the commitment. (\u00a7\u00a7 1766, 1769; see\nIn re Allen N. (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 513, 515-516.) By contrast\u2014and as shown in the\njuvenile court\u201fs order from which this appeal is taken\u2014the decision concerning release of\nthe ward from custody remains with the juvenile court judge. These two factors\ndemonstrate that such a housing order is not merely a semantically different authorization\nof the same punishment declared impermissible in In re C.H.4\n       Minor also contends a housing order pursuant to section 1752.16 violates the stare\ndecisis concepts articulated in Auto Equity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court (1962) 57 Cal.2d\n450. (\u201cThe decisions of this court are binding upon and must be followed by all the state\ncourts of California.\u201d (Id. at p. 455.)) This argument misconstrues the holding of In re\nC.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th 94. That case did not hold that wards who committed Penal Code\nsection 290.008, subdivision (c), crimes could not constitutionally be committed to DJF.\nIn re C.H. simply held that the Legislature had not authorized such commitments under\nthe statutes then existing. The Supreme Court expressly stated: \u201c[T]he Legislature is\nfree to reconsider the policy set out in the current statutes if it wishes to do so.\u201d (53\nCal.4th at p. 108.) It is clear that the Legislature has done so. For new offenses, Statutes\n2012, chapter 7, section 1, amends section 731, subdivision (a) to expand the list of\noffenses for which a ward can be committed to DJF to include the offenses listed in Penal\nCode section 290.008, subdivision (c). For persons such as minor, section 3 of chapter 7\ncreates section 1752.16, specifically permitting the type of housing order employed in the\npresent case. (See Stats. 2012, ch. 7, \u00a7 3.) In both instances there is now statutory\n\n4      In this case, the juvenile court expressed its concern that a housing order under\nsection 1752.16 might be used to justify incarceration of minor at DJF without providing\nthe services of the sexual offender program. Accordingly, the order specifies that minor\nwill be returned to county custody once he completes the sexual offender program.\n\n\n\n                                              5.\n\fauthority for a DJF order. It was placement at DJF without statutory authority that was\nprohibited in In re C.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th 94. The new statute fully satisfies the\nrequirements of In re C.H., and actions taken under it do not violate the doctrine of Auto\nEquity Sales, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 57 Cal.2d 450.\n       Minor next contends the juvenile court lacks statutory authority to authorize\nhousing at DJF because no such dispositional alternative is available under sections 202\nand 727. Section 202, subdivision (e)(4), authorizes the court to commit a ward to\njuvenile hall. As with all dispositional orders on section 602 petitions, wards \u201cshall, in\nconformity with the interests of public safety and protection, receive care, treatment, and\nguidance that is consistent with their best interest, that holds them accountable for their\nbehavior, and that is appropriate for their circumstances.\u201d (\u00a7 202, subd. (b).) \u201cIf a minor\nis adjudged a ward of the court on the ground that he or she is a person described by\nSection 601 or 602 the court may make any reasonable orders for the care, supervision,\ncustody, conduct, maintenance, and support of the minor, including medical treatment\n\u2026.\u201d (\u00a7 727, subd. (a).) Section 731, subdivision (a)(3), permits the court to order a ward\nto \u201cparticipate in a program of professional counseling as arranged and directed by the\nprobation officer as a condition of continued custody of the ward.\u201d The sexual offender\nprogram offered by DJF pursuant to section 1752.16 is merely another treatment\nalternative available to counties, and an order that a ward receive treatment through such\na program is fully authorized by sections 202, 727, and 731. The juvenile court had\nauthority to direct that the probation officer seek placement of minor in the DJF sexual\noffender program.5\n\n5      The written order in this case might be construed as ordering DJF to house minor\nduring his commitment to juvenile hall. However, the juvenile court did not order joinder\nof DJF as a party pursuant to section 727, former subdivision (a) (the statute was\namended effective Jan. 1, 2013), and, as a result, had \u201cno authority to order services\u201d\nfrom the agency. (Ibid.; see Stats. 2012, ch. 130, \u00a7 2.) It is clear from the transcript of\noral proceedings that the court, in essence, merely authorized the probation officer to\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f       Minor contends that, to the extent the statutory scheme permits the juvenile court\nto order his participation in the DJF sexual offender program, it violates the equal\nprotection guarantees of the federal and state Constitutions. (See U.S. Const., 14th\namend.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7.) He says section 1752.16, because it permits, but does not\nrequire, individual counties to contract with DJF for housing of participants in the sexual\noffender program, \u201cviolates equal protection because similarly situated wards could be\ntreated differently based simply on their county of commitment, i.e., as to whether or not\nthe county had entered into a contract with the D.J.F.\u201d Minor cites no legal authority in\nsupport of this argument, and we are aware of no authority requiring uniformity of county\nrehabilitation resources. The juvenile court in each county considers all available\nresources in making the dispositional order in any particular case. (See, e.g., \u00a7 730,\nsubd. (a).) A county with a local sexual offender program at its juvenile facility might be\nless likely to enter into a section 1752.16 contract with DJF, just as a juvenile court in\nsuch a county might exercise its discretion differently than would a juvenile court with no\nsuch local resources. Individual exercises of discretion by prosecutors and judges do not\nprovide a basis for an equal protection challenge unless the discretion involves \u201cinvidious\ndiscrimination\u201d or \u201cvindictive or retaliatory\u201d reasoning. (Manduley v. Superior Court\n(2002) 27 Cal.4th 537, 569-571 [prosecutor\u201fs charging discretion under \u00a7 707,\nsubd. (d)].) The Legislature\u201fs decision to provide an additional rehabilitation alternative\nto those counties in need of such a program does not violate the equal protection rights of\npersons in such counties that accept such an offer.\n       Minor contends the dispositional order in this case impermissibly intermingles the\nresponsibilities of the probation department and the responsibilities of DJF. He contends\n\n\nseek housing at DJF for the purpose of minor\u201fs participation in the sexual offender\nprogram during the time minor was otherwise in juvenile hall; the court did not purport to\norder DJF to accept minor into the program.\n\n\n\n                                              7.\n\fthe joint responsibility that results is unprecedented, unauthorized by the Welfare and\nInstitutions Code, and unconstitutionally vague. It is clear from the statutory scheme,\nhowever, that the juvenile court retains supervision and control over a minor. That\nsupervision and control is not altered by the minor\u201fs participation in the DJF sexual\noffender program. Unquestionably, a ward placed in a foster home, a residential\ntreatment program, or juvenile hall (or an older ward housed in the county jail under\n\u00a7 208.5) is answerable on a daily basis to those who operate the program, but that does\nnot change the ultimate responsibility of the juvenile court for the ward\u201fs supervision and\ncontrol. (See \u00a7 727, subd. (a).) Similarly, when a ward is committed to juvenile hall\npursuant to section 202, subdivision (e)(4), and housed at DJF pursuant to\nsection 1752.16, the juvenile court retains ultimate responsibility for supervision and\ncontrol. The responsibility of a service provider, in this case DJF, for the day-to-day\noperation of the program for wards, with ultimate supervision and control in the juvenile\ncourt, is not unprecedented; it is, as stated, the same as a myriad of placements of wards\nunder the Welfare and Institutions Code. The supervisory relationship is authorized by\nsections 727, subdivision (a) and 1752.16, and that relationship does not result in an\nunconstitutionally vague order: The juvenile court clearly ordered that minor\n\u201csuccessful[ly] complet[e]\u201d DJF\u201fs sexual offender program. The court clearly has the\nretained jurisdiction to determine whether minor has done so.\n       Minor next contends section 1752.16 is an unconstitutional ex post facto law.\n(See U.S. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 10; Cal. Const., art. 1, \u00a7 9.) The state and federal ex post facto\nlaws have the same meaning. (John L. v. Superior Court (2004) 33 Cal.4th 158, 171-\n172.) \u201c[N]o statute falls within the ex post facto prohibition unless \u201etwo critical\nelements\u201f exist.\u201d (Id. at p. 172.) \u201cFirst, the law must be retroactive.\u201d (Ibid.)\nSection 1752.16 is applicable to minor solely because he was, prior to the effective date\nof that section, the subject of a section 602 petition charging a crime listed in Penal Code\nsection 290.008, subdivision (c), and was serving a commitment to DJF on the date In re\n\n                                              8.\n\fC.H., supra, 53 Cal.4th 94 was decided. Accordingly, the first requirement for a\nprohibited ex post facto law is met.\n       The second requirement for a prohibited ex post facto law is that the law must\nhave one or more of the following four effects: it makes criminal acts that were innocent\nwhen done; it makes the crime greater or more aggravated than it was when committed; it\ninflicts a greater punishment for the crime than was available when the crime was\ncommitted; or it alters the rules of evidence or the required proof for conviction. (John\nL., supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 172 & fn. 3.)\n       Minor contends section 1752.16 violates the third of these prohibitions; that is, he\ncontends section 1752.16 increases the punishment that could have been imposed upon\nhim at the time he committed his section 602 offense. This contention is without merit.\nBoth before and after the enactment of section 1752.16, a ward could be confined in a\nvariety of juvenile institutions run by the county (\u00a7 730, subd. (a)) and could be ordered\nto \u201cparticipate in a program of professional counseling as arranged and directed by the\nprobation officer as a condition of continued custody of the ward.\u201d (\u00a7 731, subd. (a)(3).)\nThe mere fact that the state created an additional resource to provide sexual offender\ntreatment, and that this resource was in a different location than the existing local\nprograms, does not constitute an increase in the punishment authorized for purposes of\nthe ex post facto clauses. (See People v. Cruz (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 664, 672, fn. 8\n[serving sentence locally is not lesser punishment than serving same length sentence in\nstate prison for ex post facto purposes].)\n       In addition, for wards of minor\u201fs age, section 208.5, both before and after the\nenactment of section 1752.16, permitted a ward who is committed to juvenile hall to be\nhoused in the county jail. (See In re Ramon M. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 665, 673.) It\ncannot realistically be argued that housing at DJF for the limited purpose of successful\ncompletion of the sexual offender program is a greater punishment than a fixed term of\ncommitment to juvenile hall, with housing at the county jail, where the ward has no\n\n                                              9.\n\fability to effectuate his release through completion of a counseling program. Because it\ndoes not authorize punishment of a type or duration greater than permitted before its\nenactment, section 1752.16 is not a prohibited ex post facto law.\n       Minor\u201fs remaining contentions are not supported by the record. First, he contends\nthe juvenile court abused its discretion by failing to consider local alternatives to the DJF\nsexual offender program. However, the probation officer contacted a local residential\nprogram which informed the officer it would not accept minor because he was ineligible\nfor foster-care placement (due to his age), and the probation officer stated reasons why no\nother residential facilities were available. The juvenile court fully considered these\nalternatives. Minor has not demonstrated the court abused its discretion. (See In re\nRobert H. (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1317, 1329-1330.) Second, minor contends the juvenile\ncourt erred by continuing minor \u201con probation\u201d and erred in attempting to \u201cretain[]\njurisdiction\u201d to impose conditions of probation at a later date.
