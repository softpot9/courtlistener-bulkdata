We reject\n\nSmith\u2019s argument and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.\n\n               We review Smith\u2019s sentence under a deferential abuse-\n\nof-discretion standard.

This      review      requires\n\nconsideration             of         both        the        procedural          and       substantive\n\nreasonableness of the sentence.

After\n\ndetermining whether the district court correctly calculated the\n\nadvisory       Guidelines            range,      we     must      decide     whether       the      court\n\nconsidered       the       \u00a7     3553(a)          factors,           analyzed       the     arguments\n\npresented       by     the       parties,             and     sufficiently          explained        the\n\nselected sentence.

United States v.\n\nMendoza\u2013Mendoza, 597 F.3d 212, 216-17 (4th Cir. 2010).                             Where\n\nthe district court imposes a departure or variant sentence, we\n\nconsider    \u201cwhether     the    sentencing         court   acted    reasonably     both\n\nwith respect to its decision to impose such a sentence and with\n\nrespect    to   the   extent     of   the    divergence      from    the   sentencing\n\nrange.\u201d     United States v. Hernandez-Villanueva, 473 F.3d 118,\n\n123 (4th Cir. 2007).             The district court \u201chas flexibility in\n\nfashioning a sentence outside of the Guidelines range,\u201d and need\n\nonly \u201c\u2018set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that it\n\nhas considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis\u2019\u201d\n\nfor its decision.        United States v. Diosdado-Star, 630 F.3d 359,\n\n364 (4th Cir. 2011) (quoting Rita v. United States, 551 U.S.\n\n338, 356 (2007)) (brackets omitted).\n\n            Smith asks us to vacate his sentence and remand to the\n\ndistrict court for resentencing.                  According to Smith, sentencing\n\nhim   as    a    career        offender          was   \u201cunnecessary\u201d       given    the\n\ncircumstances of his case.             We have reviewed the record and have\n\nconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and conclude that the district\n\n                                             3\n\fcourt    properly     exercised        its       discretion     to     reject     Smith\u2019s\n\narguments in mitigation.

Jeffery, 631 F.3d\n\n669, 679-80 (4th Cir. 2011) (recognizing that appellate courts\n\nmust give due deference to district court\u2019s broad discretion in\n\ndetermining     weight    to    be      given       to   \u00a7 3553(a)       factors     when\n\nchoosing an appropriate sentence); United States v.
