We conclude that the United States may garnish DeCay\u2019s\nand Barre\u2019s retirement benefits to satisfy a criminal restitution order, but that\nthe United States is limited to garnishing twenty-five percent of Barre\u2019s monthly\npension benefit. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s entry of the final\n\f   Case: 09-30218    Document: 00511238933     Page: 2   Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                  No. 09-30218\n\ngarnishment orders as to Barre, AFFIRM as to DeCay, and REMAND for\nproceedings consistent with our holding.\n                     I. Factual & Procedural Background\n      Kerry DeCay and Stanford Barre pleaded guilty to one count each of mail\nfraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and obstruction of justice for their roles\nin a scheme to defraud the City of New Orleans (\u201cthe City\u201d). At sentencing, the\ndistrict court determined that the City had suffered an injury compensable\nunder the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), and ordered DeCay and\nBarre to pay $1,064,362.15, jointly and severally, in restitution. After judgment\nwas entered, the United States moved for writs of garnishment under the\nFederal Debt Collection Procedures Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d) seeking seizure of the\ndefendants\u2019 interests in their pension funds to satisfy the restitution order. The\ndistrict court found that the statutory prerequisites to garnishment were\nsatisfied, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3205(b), and issued the writs of garnishment to the\nLSPRF.\n      The LSPRF answered the garnishment orders by stating that DeCay\ncurrently was eligible only for an immediate lump-sum withdrawal of the\n$77,898 he had contributed toward his retirement and that Barre was currently\nreceiving a monthly pension benefit of $2,464.72. The LSPRF asserted that the\npension benefits were exempt from seizure under federal and Louisiana law and\nthat enforcement of the writs against it as garnishee would violate the Tenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. The LSPRF also argued that, to\nthe extent that garnishment is proper, the United States failed to follow the\nappropriate formal procedures to withdraw DeCay\u2019s employee contributions.\nRegarding Barre, the LSPRF argued that even if garnishment were proper, the\nConsumer Credit Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) limits the United States\u2019 right to\ngarnish Barre\u2019s pension to twenty-five percent of his monthly benefit.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f   Case: 09-30218      Document: 00511238933        Page: 3     Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                     No. 09-30218\n\n       DeCay, proceeding pro se, adopted the LSPRF\u2019s brief. Barre also objected\nto the writ of garnishment against him, asserting that the Tenth Amendment\nprecludes the United States from garnishing his pension benefits and, in the\nalternative, that the CCPA prohibits the United States from garnishing more\nthan twenty-five percent of his pension benefits.\n       The district court overruled the appellants\u2019 objections to the garnishment\nwrits and held that the United States could garnish the entire amount of\nDeCay\u2019s contributions to the LSPRF ($77,898), as well as the full amount of the\nmonthly benefits paid by the LSPRF to Barre ($2,464.72). Accordingly, the\ndistrict court entered final orders of garnishment compelling the LSPRF to\nimmediately pay the United States $77,898, representing the present cash-out\nvalue of DeCay\u2019s employee contributions to the LSPRF, as well as 100% of any\nfuture distributions of pension funds due to Barre. The LSPRF and Barre filed\nmotions for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment. DeCay adopted the\nLSPRF\u2019s motion. The district court denied the motions.\n       The LSPRF, DeCay, and Barre filed the instant appeal.1 They assert that\nthe garnishment orders violate federal and Louisiana law, including the Tenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. The appellants argue in the\nalternative that, if garnishment is proper, the district court erred by not\nrequiring the United States to complete certain formalities before withdrawing\nDeCay\u2019s employee contributions and by allowing the United States to garnish\nthe full amount of Barre\u2019s monthly pension benefit.\n                                II. Standard of Review\n       We review a district court\u2019s construction and application of a statute de\nnovo. United States v. Williams, 602 F.3d 313, 315 (5th Cir. 2010); see also\n\n      1\n          The LSPRF timely filed an appeal from the final orders of garnishment entered\nagainst DeCay and Barre. Barre timely appealed the final order of garnishment entered\nagainst him. DeCay filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his adopted motion for a new\ntrial or to alter or amend the judgment.\n\n                                            3\n\f   Case: 09-30218    Document: 00511238933      Page: 4   Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                  No. 09-30218\n\nUnited States v. Anderson, 559 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir. 2009) (stating that this\ncourt reviews the constitutionality of a federal statute de novo). Similarly, the\n\u201cpreemptive effect of a federal statute is a question of law that we review de\nnovo.\u201d Franks Inv. Co. LLC v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 593 F.3d 404, 407 (5th Cir.\n2010).\n                                  III. Standing\n      Before we address the merits of the appellants\u2019 arguments, we must\ndetermine whether the LSPRF has standing to assert arguments on appeal.\nUnited States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief & Dev., 445 F.3d 771, 779 (5th Cir.\n2006) (\u201cWhen standing is placed in issue in a case, the question is whether the\nperson whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication\nof a particular issue and not whether the issue itself is justiciable.\u201d) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). The United States asserts that the\nLSPRF lacks standing to object to the writs of garnishment because the LSPRF\ndoes not have a personal interest in the retirement benefits and thus has not\nsuffered an injury-in-fact.\n      In addressing a plaintiff\u2019s standing, the Supreme Court has required:\n      (1) \u2018injury in fact,\u2019 by which we mean an invasion of a legally\n      protected interest that is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b)\n      actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) a causal\n      relationship between the injury and the challenged conduct, by\n      which we mean that the injury fairly can be traced to the\n      challenged action of the defendant, and has not resulted from the\n      independent action of some third party not before the court; and\n      (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable\n      decision, by which we mean that the prospect of obtaining relief\n      from the injury as a result of the favorable ruling is not too\n      speculative.\n\nNe. Fla. Chapter of the Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508\nU.S. 656, 663-64 (1993) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The\nSupreme Court further has observed that the nature and extent of the facts that\n\n\n                                        4\n\f   Case: 09-30218      Document: 00511238933        Page: 5    Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                     No. 09-30218\n\nmust be alleged to establish standing \u201cdepends considerably upon whether the\nplaintiff is himself an object of the action . . . at issue. If he is, there is ordinarily\nlittle question that the action or inaction has caused him injury, and that a\njudgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.\u201d Lujan v. Defenders\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561-62 (1992). But when \u201ca plaintiff\u2019s asserted injury\narises from the government\u2019s allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of\nregulation) of someone else, much more is needed.\u201d Id. at 562.\n      Of course, the LSPRF did not come to court seeking relief.            The United\nStates obtained an order compelling the LSPRF to turn over funds in its\npossession representing any interest DeCay and Barre may have in any property\nsubject to the LSPRF\u2019s control, thus drawing the LSPRF into the instant\nlitigation. The writs of garnishment compel the LSPRF to take particular action,\nand the LSPRF asserts that the ordered action is unconstitutional under the\nTenth Amendment and, as to DeCay, subjects it to potential double exposure in\nthe future. In essence, the LSPRF is saying to the court \u201cyou can\u2019t make me do\nthis.\u201d Having been brought before the court involuntarily by another party, we\nconclude that the LSPRF has the ability to say it cannot be the object of such\ncourt actions. 2 Accordingly, the LSPRF, as the object of the writ of garnishment\nand as a sovereign entity, has standing to assert that the United States lacks the\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         Of course whether LSPRF has standing to make the argument is distinct from\nwhether the argument has merit, a matter we address later.\n\n                                            5\n\f   Case: 09-30218       Document: 00511238933          Page: 6     Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                       No. 09-30218\n\nconstitutional authority to compel it to release the funds.3 See Lujan, 504 U.S.\nat 561; Holy Land Found., 445 F.3d at 780.4\n       We need not decide whether the LSPRF has standing to raise the\nremaining objections to garnishment because DeCay and Barre plainly have\nstanding to assert exemptions to the garnishment of their property. Because\nDeCay and Barre raise the same objections to garnishment that the LSPRF\nmakes, this court has jurisdiction to decide the case. See Arlington Heights v.\nMetro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 263-64 (1977) (\u201cIn the ordinary case, a\nparty is denied standing to assert the rights of third persons. But we need not\ndecide whether the circumstances of this case would justify departure from that\nprudential limitation . . . [f]or we have at least one individual plaintiff who has\ndemonstrated standing to assert these rights as his own.\u201d); see also Horne v.\nFlores, 129 S. Ct. 2579, 2592 (2009) (\u201cBecause the superintendent clearly has\nstanding to challenge the lower courts\u2019 decisions, we need not consider whether\nthe Legislators also have standing to do so.\u201d).              Having concluded that the\nappellants possess standing to challenge the final orders of garnishment, we now\nturn to the merits of this dispute.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The LSPRF\u2019s position in this case is similar to that of a garnishee asserting that the\ndistrict court lacks personal jurisdiction over it or a foreign garnishee asserting immunity as\na defense to the garnishment order. We have never held that a garnishee in either of those\nsituations lacks standing to object to the garnishment proceeding. See, e.g., FG Hemisphere\nAssocs., LLC v. Republique du Congo, 455 F.3d 575, 584 (5th Cir. 2006) (\u201cThe sovereign\nimmunity claim may be raised by a garnishee as well as a foreign sovereign.\u201d); Stena Rederi\nAB v. Comision de Contratos del Comite Ejecutivo Gen., 923 F.2d 380, 391-92 (5th Cir. 1991)\n(holding that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the garnishee and that the\ngarnishee, as an agency of a foreign state, was \u201centitled to invoke the shield of sovereign\nimmunity, whether against direct claims or an indirect writ of garnishment\u201d).\n       4\n         Because of our conclusion that the double exposure question is not ripe, see infra at\nSection IV.C., we do not decide whether LSPRF has standing to urge its argument that the\ncourt\u2019s order subjects it to double exposure.\n\n                                               6\n\f   Case: 09-30218      Document: 00511238933         Page: 7     Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                      No. 09-30218\n\n                                        IV. Merits\n       The MVRA makes restitution mandatory for certain crimes, \u201cincluding any\noffense committed by fraud or deceit,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1), (c)(1)(A)(ii), and\nauthorizes the United States to enforce a restitution order in accordance with its\ncivil enforcement powers.5        The MVRA broadly permits the United States,\nnotwithstanding any other federal law, to enforce a restitution order \u201cagainst all\nproperty or rights to property of the person fined.\u201d \u00a7 3613(a). Section 3613 of\nthe MVRA sets forth several enumerated exceptions to the United States\u2019\nauthority to garnish any and all of the debtor\u2019s property to satisfy a restitution\norder; however, the statute does not exempt state-run pension plans.6 Further,\n\u00a7 3613(a)(2) explicitly states that the exemptions contained in the FDCPA, 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 3014, do not apply to the enforcement of a federal criminal judgment.\n       The appellants collectively make three arguments why the district court\nerred in issuing the final garnishment orders against Barre and Decay. First,\nthe appellants assert that the defendants\u2019 pension benefits are exempt from\ngarnishment under federal and state law. Second, Barre argues that, if the\nUnited States may garnish his retirement benefits, the CCPA limits the United\nStates to garnishment of twenty-five percent of his monthly pension benefits.\nThird, the LSPRF, joined by DeCay, asserts that, if the United States is allowed\nto garnish Decay\u2019s contributions into his retirement, the United States is\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        The FDCPA sets forth the civil enforcement procedures used by the United States to\nrecover monies owed under a restitution order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001(a)(1).\n       6\n         The MVRA incorporates most of the exemptions contained in \u00a7 6334(a)of the Internal\nRevenue Code, which exempts particular property from levy for payment of federal taxes. The\nonly \u00a7 6334 exemption relevant to pension plans applies to four types of federally authorized\npension plans, including Railroad Retirement Act pensions, Railroad Unemployment\nInsurance Act pensions, and pensions received by certain military-service persons. I.R.C.\n\u00a7 6334(a)(6). None of these exemptions are applicable to the pension benefit plan at issue in\nthe instant case.\n\n                                             7\n\f   Case: 09-30218     Document: 00511238933     Page: 8   Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                  No. 09-30218\n\nrequired to apply for a withdrawal of DeCay\u2019s employee contributions. We\naddress each of these arguments in turn.\nA. Garnishment of Pension Benefits Under the MVRA\n      The appellants assert that the United States may not garnish pension\nbenefits under the MVRA because (1) \u00a7 401(a)(13) of the Internal Revenue Code\n(\u201cIRC\u201d) makes pension benefits inalienable; (2) the Tenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution precludes the United States from garnishing pension\nfunds controlled by the LSPRF; and (3) Louisiana constitutional and statutory\nlaw exempt pension benefits from garnishment.\n1. IRC \u00a7 401(a)(13)\n      The LSPRF argues that the defendants\u2019 pension benefits are exempt from\ngarnishment because the IRC prohibits the assignment or alienation of\nretirement benefits. I.R.C. \u00a7 401(a)(13)(A). Section 401(a)(13)(A) states that \u201c[a]\ntrust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of\nwhich such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may\nnot be assigned or alienated.\u201d     This circuit has never addressed whether\n\u00a7 3613(a) of the MVRA overrides \u00a7 401(a)(13) of the IRC.\n      Section 3613(a) of the MVRA states that \u201cNotwithstanding any other\nFederal law . . . a judgment imposing a fine may be enforced against all property\nor rights to property of the person fined.\u201d (emphasis added). This language is\nqualified only by the enumerated exceptions contained in \u00a7 3613(a)(1)\u2013(3). We\nconclude that the language in \u00a7 3613(a) authorizing the United States to enforce\na garnishment order against \u201call property or rights to property\u201d of the debtor,\n\u201c[n]otwithstanding any other Federal law,\u201d is sufficient to override the anti-\nalienation provision of the IRC. Several factors compel us to conclude that the\nMVRA allows garnishment of a defendant\u2019s retirement benefits to satisfy a\ncriminal restitution order.\n\n\n\n                                        8\n\f   Case: 09-30218    Document: 00511238933      Page: 9   Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                  No. 09-30218\n\n      First, the Supreme Court has recognized that the use of a\n\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause signals Congressional intent to supersede conflicting\nprovisions of any other statute. Caseros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 508 U.S. 10, 18\n(1993) (\u201c[T]he use of such a \u2018notwithstanding\u2019 clause clearly signals the drafter\u2019s\nintention that the provisions of the \u2018notwithstanding\u2019 section override conflicting\nprovisions of any other section. Likewise, the Courts of Appeals generally have\ninterpreted similar \u2018notwithstanding\u2019 language . . . to supersede all other laws,\nstating that a clearer statement is difficult to imagine.\u201d) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\n      The appellants argue that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause is insufficient to\noverride the anti-alienation language in \u00a7 401(a)(13) of the IRC under the\nSupreme Court\u2019s decision in Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension\nFund, 493 U.S. 365 (1990). In Guidry, the Supreme Court was faced with the\nquestion of whether \u00a7 501(b) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure\nAct of 1959 (\u201cLMRDA\u201d)\u2014which provided pension funds with a private right of\naction to \u201crecover damages or secure an accounting or other appropriate relief\nfor the benefit of the labor organizations\u201d\u2014allowed the government to create a\nconstructive trust on a defendant\u2019s pension benefits. The Court held that the\n\u201cother appropriate relief\u201d language in the LMRDA was insufficient to override\nthe anti-alienation provision in \u00a7 206(d) of the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (\u201cERISA\u201d). Id. at 375-76 (\u201cWe do not believe that congressional\nintent would be effectuated by reading the LMRDA\u2019s general reference to \u2018other\nappropriate relief\u2019 as overriding an express, specific congressional directive that\npension benefits not be subject to assignment or alienation.\u201d).\n      Unlike the general \u201cother appropriate relief\u201d language contained in the\nLMRDA, the \u201cnotwithstanding any other Federal law\u201d clause signals a clear\nCongressional intent to override conflicting federal law. Indeed, we agree with\nour sister circuit that \u201cit appears that Congress accepted the Supreme Court\u2019s\n\n\n                                        9\n\f  Case: 09-30218      Document: 00511238933     Page: 10   Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                  No. 09-30218\n\ninvitation in Guidry by enacting the [MVRA].\u201d United States v. Irving, 452 F.3d\n110, 126 (2d Cir. 2003); see also United States v. Novak, 476 F.3d 1041, 1053 (9th\nCir. 2007) (en banc) (\u201cIn sum, all standard principles of statutory construction\nsupport the conclusion that MVRA authorizes the enforcement of restitution\norders against retirement plan benefits, the anti-alienation provision of ERISA\nnotwithstanding.\u201d).    Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that Congress\nexempted certain retirement plans from garnishment under the MVRA, see\n\u00a7 3613(a)(1) (incorporating the exemptions in IRC \u00a7 6334(a)(6) for certain federal\nannuity and pension payments), but did not include state-run pension plans in\nthe list. Cf. Waggoner v. Gonzales, 488 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir. 2007) (\u201cThe canon\nof statutory construction \u2018expressio unius est exclusio alterius (the expression of\none thing is the exclusion of another)\u2019 indicates that [the listed ground] is the\nonly requirement.\u201d) (citation omitted).\n      Second, reading \u00a7 3613(a) to allow garnishment of the defendants\u2019\nretirement benefits is consistent with the MVRA\u2019s statutory scheme and\npurpose.   The only property exempt from garnishment under \u00a7 3613(a) is\nproperty that the government cannot seize to satisfy the payment of federal\nincome taxes.      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a).       Section 3613(c) underscores the\nCongressional directive that restitution orders should be satisfied in the same\nmanner as tax liabilities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(c) (stating that an order of restitution\nimposed under this chapter \u201cis a lien in favor of the United States on all property\nand rights to property of the person fined as if the liability of the person fined\nwere a liability for a tax assessed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\")\n(emphasis added). As we have already recognized, pension plan benefits are\nsubject to levy under the IRC to collect unpaid taxes. See Shanbaum v. United\nStates, 32 F.3d 180, 183 (5th Cir. 1994); see also Irving, 452 F.3d at 126 (\u201cERISA\npension plans are not exempted from payment of taxes under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6334\n[of the IRC], and thus they should not be exempted from payment of criminal\n\n                                        10\n\f  Case: 09-30218    Document: 00511238933      Page: 11    Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                  No. 09-30218\n\nfines. . . . Moreover, \u00a7 3613(c) [of the MVRA] demands that criminal fines in\nfavor of the United States should be enforced in the same manner as a tax\nliability would be enforced.\u201d).\n      Third, other circuit and district courts have concluded that the United\nStates may garnish a defendant\u2019s pension benefits to satisfy a restitution order,\ndespite similar anti-alienation language contained in \u00a7 206(d) of ERISA. See\nIrving, 452 F.3d at 126; Novak, 476 F.3d at 1053; United States v. Lazorwitz, 411\nF. Supp. 2d 634, 637 (E.D.N.C. 2005) (holding that \u201cneither ERISA\u2019s anti-\nalienation provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1), nor the anti-alienation provision in\nthe Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(a)(13), provide a bar to the\ngarnishment of a qualified pension plan\u201d). Section 206(d) of ERISA states: \u201cEach\npension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be\nassigned or alienated.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1). We find these cases persuasive,\nsee Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S. 753, 759 (1992) (referring to IRC \u00a7 401(a)(13)\nand ERISA \u00a7 206(d) as \u201ccoordinate section[s]\u201d containing \u201csimilar restrictions\u201d),\nand conclude that \u00a7 3613(a) of the MVRA authorizes the United States to\ngarnish retirement benefits, notwithstanding the anti-alienation provision in\n\u00a7 401(a)(13) of the IRC.\n2. The Tenth Amendment\n      The appellants also argue that the garnishment writs violate the Tenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.          This claim hinges on the\nappellants\u2019 contention that federal law does not govern state-run benefit plans\nand the MVRA does not supersede Louisiana\u2019s broad police powers. We reject\nthe appellants\u2019 Tenth Amendment argument.\n      The Tenth Amendment declares that \u201cpowers not delegated to the United\nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the\nStates respectively, or to the people.\u201d U.S. C ONST. amend. X. When Congress\nproperly exercises its authority under an enumerated constitutional power, the\n\n\n                                        11\n\f  Case: 09-30218       Document: 00511238933          Page: 12     Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                       No. 09-30218\n\nTenth Amendment is not implicated. See New York v. United States, 505 U.S.\n144, 156 (1992); Deer Park Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Harris County Appraisal Dist.,\n132 F.3d 1095, 1099 (5th Cir. 1998). The appellants do not contest that Congress\npassed the MVRA and FDCPA pursuant to an enumerated constitutional power.7\n       Nor do the appellants contest that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants\nCongress the authority to craft appropriate penalties to enforce its criminal laws.\nUnited States v. Comstock, 130 S. Ct. 1949, 1958 (2010) (\u201cNeither Congress\u2019\npower to criminalize conduct, nor its power to imprison individuals who engage\nin that conduct, nor its power to enact laws governing prisons and prisoners, is\nexplicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But Congress nonetheless possesses\nbroad authority to do each of those things in the course of \u2018carrying into\nExecution\u2019 the enumerated powers \u2018vested by\u2019 the \u2018Constitution in the\nGovernment of the United States,\u2019 Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 18 - - authority granted by the\nNecessary and Proper Clause.\u201d).8\n       The appellants assert that allowing the United States to garnish pension\nbenefits administered by the LSPRF violates the Tenth Amendment because the\nfederal government is interfering with state administration of pension benefits.\nThe appellants argument here is misdirected. Garnishing DeCay\u2019s and Barre\u2019s\npension benefits has no effect on Louisiana state law; rather it penalizes DeCay\nand Barre for violating federal law.            While the LSPRF is implicated as a\ngarnishee, its pension system is not altered by requiring the LSRPF to pay the\n\n\n       7\n        It is also undisputed that Congress had the authority to convict Barre and DeCay of\nthe predicate crimes underlying the restitution order. See, e.g., United States v. Brumley, 116\nF.3d 728, 730 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding that the Commerce Clause supports the mail fraud\ncriminal statute).\n       8\n        The parties submitted letters briefing the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in\nComstock on the instant case. See FED . R. APP . P. 28(j). We agree with the Government that\nComstock supports a conclusion that Congress properly exercised its authority to enact the\nMVRA making restitution mandatory for particular crimes and that, pursuant to this\nauthority, the United States may garnish a defendant\u2019s state pension benefits.\n\n                                              12\n\f  Case: 09-30218    Document: 00511238933       Page: 13   Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                   No. 09-30218\n\nUnited States, rather than the judgment-debtors. Further, to the extent that a\nstate desires to participate in the management of pension benefits, it must\nsubmit to federal criminal and civil laws allowing for debt-collection measures.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3003(d) (stating that the FDCPA \u201cshall preempt State law to the\nextent such law is inconsistent with a provision of this chapter\u201d). The federal\ngovernment\u2019s inability to garnish state-run pension benefits would substantially\nimpair the effectiveness of the FDCPA and MVRA. See United States v. Phillips,\n303 F.3d 548, 551 (5th Cir. 2002) (\u201cThe FDCPA . . . provides a uniform system\nfor prosecutors to follow rather than resorting to the non-uniform procedures\nprovided by the states.\u201d). Because the United States has the constitutional\nauthority to impose mandatory restitution for particular federal crimes and seek\ngarnishment of any available resources to satisfy that restitution order, we reject\nthe appellants\u2019 Tenth Amendment challenge.\n3. Louisiana Law\n      The appellants assert that the United States lacks the authority to garnish\nDeCay\u2019s and Barre\u2019s pension benefits because Louisiana law precludes\nenforcement of a restitution order against pension benefits. See L A. C ONST. art.\nX, \u00a7 29(E)(5)(a) (1974); L A. R EV. S TAT. \u00a7 11:2182 (1991). To the extent Louisiana\nlaw is inconsistent with the FDCPA and MVRA, Louisiana law is preempted.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3003(d); see also United States v. Wilson, No. CR-305-008, 2007 WL\n4557774, at *1 n.2 (S.D. Ga. Dec. 20, 2007) (\u201cTo the extent that state law . . .\nconflicts with federal law authorizing the garnishment of Defendant\u2019s pension\nbenefits, it is preempted.\u201d); United States v. McClanahan, No.3:03-00053, 2006\nWL 1455698, at *4 (S.D. W. Va. May 24, 2006) (\u201cAlthough West Virginia\nprohibits the garnishment of state pensions, federal law expressly preempts\nstate exemptions when the federal government is attempting to collect a fine or\nrestitution.\u201d).\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f  Case: 09-30218   Document: 00511238933    Page: 14   Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                No. 09-30218\n\n      In sum, the MVRA authorizes the United States to use its civil\nenforcement powers to garnish a defendant\u2019s retirement plan benefits,\nnotwithstanding the fact that pension benefits are generally inalienable under\nfederal and state law.\nB. The CCPA\u2019s Limitation on Garnishment of Disposable Earnings\n      The LSPRF and Barre assert that, even if Barre\u2019s retirement benefits are\nsubject to garnishment, the United States cannot garnish more than twenty-five\npercent of Barre\u2019s monthly pension benefits under \u00a7 303 of the CCPA. Section\n3613(a)(3) of the MVRA states that the protections of the CCPA shall apply to\nenforcement of the judgment under either federal or state law. The CCPA\nprovides that\n      the maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an\n      individual for any workweek which is subjected to garnishment may\n      not exceed\n            (1) 25 per centum of his disposable earnings for that\n            week, or\n            (2) the amount by which his disposable earnings for\n            that week exceed thirty times the Federal minimum\n            hourly wage prescribed by section 206(a)(1) of Title 29\n            in effect at the time the earnings are payable,\n            whichever is less. In the case of earnings for any pay\n            period other than a week, the Secretary of Labor shall\n            by regulation prescribe a multiple of the Federal\n            minimum hourly wage equivalent in effect to that set\n            forth in paragraph (2).\n\n\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673(a).\n      The parties dispute whether Barre\u2019s monthly benefit payments constitute\n\u201cearnings\u201d under the CCPA. The CCPA defines \u201cearnings\u201d as \u201ccompensation\npaid or payable for personal services, whether denominated as wages, salary,\ncommission, bonus, or otherwise, and includes periodic payments pursuant to a\npension or retirement program.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1672(a) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\f  Case: 09-30218    Document: 00511238933     Page: 15   Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                 No. 09-30218\n\n      The Supreme Court has cautioned that the terms \u201cearnings\u201d and\n\u201cdisposable earnings\u201d under the CCPA are \u201climited to \u2018periodic payments of\ncompensation and (do) not pertain to every asset that is traceable in some way\nto such compensation.\u2019\u201d Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U.S. 642, 651 (1974) (citation\nomitted). Here, the question is whether payments made from an employer\u2019s\nretirement program to an employee are too attenuated to be considered\n\u201cearnings\u201d under the CCPA.\n      The district courts around the country have divided over whether monthly\npension-benefit payments constitute \u201cearnings\u201d under the CCPA.           Several\ndistrict courts have concluded that \u201conce passed to a retirement account or\nannuity in the hands of the employee, the funds in the account or annuity are\nnot \u2018earnings\u2019 under the CCPA, and thus not subject to the 25% cap, even if they\nare distributed in periodic payments\u2014in other words, the distributions from the\nfund to the defendant are not \u2018disposable earnings\u2019 under \u00a7 303.\u201d United States\nv. Belan, No. 2:07-x-50979, 2008 WL 2444496, at *3 (E.D. Mich. June 13, 2008);\nsee also United States v. Crawford, F-04-0200, 2006 WL 2458710, at *2-3 (E.D.\nCal. Aug. 22, 2006); United States v. Laws, 352 F. Supp. 2d 707, 713-14 (E.D. Va.\n2004). However, at least one district court has reached the opposite conclusion\nand held that periodic payments of retirement benefits are \u201cearnings\u201d under the\nCCPA.    McLanahan, 2006 WL 1455698, at *3 (holding that \u201cunder clear\nstatutory language, it appears that the Government may garnish only 25% of the\nDefendant\u2019s pension\u201d).\n      We find the statutory language unambiguous and hold that the United\nStates may garnish only twenty-five percent of Barre\u2019s monthly pension benefits.\nThe statute explicitly defines \u201cearnings\u201d to include \u201cperiodic payments made\npursuant to a pension or retirement program.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1672(a)(emphasis\nadded). The term \u201cpursuant to\u201d is generally defined as \u201cin compliance with; in\naccordance with; under [or] . . . as authorized by . . . [or] in carrying out.\u201d\n\n                                       15\n\f  Case: 09-30218       Document: 00511238933          Page: 16      Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                       No. 09-30218\n\nB LACK\u2019S L AW D ICTIONARY (8th ed. 2004).9 The parties do not dispute the terms\nof the pension plan or that the plan entitles Barre to monthly pension-benefit\npayments. Because the United States does not dispute that the terms of the\npension plan authorize Barre to receive monthly pension benefits, we conclude\nthat the payments are being made \u201cpursuant to\u201d the pension fund and therefore\nconstitute \u201cearnings\u201d under the CCPA.10 Accordingly, we conclude that the\nUnited States may not garnish more than twenty-five percent of Barre\u2019s monthly\npension benefits under the CCPA.\nC. Formalities of DeCay\u2019s Cash-Out\n       Finally, the LSPRF asserts that the district court erred by allowing the\nUnited States to cash-out DeCay\u2019s contributions to his retirement account\nwithout applying for a refund. The LSPRF asserts that the garnishment order\nas to DeCay is either improper or incomplete because the United States did not\napply for a withdrawal of DeCay\u2019s benefits. The final garnishment order issued\nby the district court compels the LSPRF to \u201cimmediately pay to the United\n\n\n       9\n         We observe that the cases cited by the United States misquote the statutory language\ndefining \u201cearnings\u201d in concluding that payments to a pension fund are earnings, whereas\npayments from a pension fund are not. Those cases mistakenly quote the statutory definition\nof earnings as limited to \u201cperiodic payments to a pension or retirement program.\u201d See Belan,\n2006 WL 2444496, at *3, Laws, 352 F. Supp. 2d at 713; Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 965 F. Supp.\n104, 109 (D. Mass. 1996). We conclude that the \u201cpursuant to\u201d phrase includes periodic\npayments from the pension fund to the employee if the payments are being made in\naccordance with the terms of the plan.\n       10\n         Our conclusion is also consistent with the legislative history and Congressional intent\nbehind the passage of \u00a7 303 of the CCPA. In passing the CCPA, Congress was attempting to\ncombat the problems of unemployment and bankruptcy that frequently resulted from the\nunrestricted garnishment of a debtor\u2019s wages. H.R. REP . NO . 1040, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968),\nreprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1962, 1979. The Committee explicitly recognized that\nunrestricted garnishment of a debtor\u2019s wages frequently resulted in \u201ca disruption of\nemployment, production, and consumption,\u201d harming the debtor and interstate commerce. Id.\nat 1063. Retirement benefits, like wages, are intended to provide a \u201ccontinued means of\nsupport\u201d and subsistence for a judgment-debtor and his family. Congress incorporated \u00a7 303\nof the CCPA into the MVRA, recognizing that the purpose of a restitution order would be\nthwarted if it simultaneously turned the judgment-debtor into a ward of the state and denied\nthe debtor the ability to \u201cinsure a continued means of support\u201d for him and his family.\n\n                                              16\n\f  Case: 09-30218     Document: 00511238933     Page: 17    Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                  No. 09-30218\n\nStates of America the amount of $77,898.00, which represents the present cash-\nout value of DeCay\u2019s pension account with the LSPRF.\u201d\n      The parties do not dispute that DeCay is currently entitled to cash-out his\nemployee contributions, and the LSPRF does not suggest that DeCay\u2019s right to\ncash-out his contributions is in any way conditional.        Instead, the LSPRF\nasserts that the United States must apply for a refund of DeCay\u2019s contributions\nbecause the LSPRF may be subject to future liability if the United States is not\nforced to execute paperwork waiving DeCay\u2019s future pension benefits. Louisiana\nlaw requires a pension beneficiary to apply for a reimbursement of his employee\ncontributions, thereby extinguishing the employee\u2019s rights in the pension fund.\nSee L A. R EV. S TAT. A NN. \u00a7 11:2175(C)(1) (1995) (stating that an eligible member\n\u201cmay apply for and obtain a refund of the amount of his contributions by making\napplication on the form furnished by the fund . . . A refund automatically cancels\nall rights in the fund\u201d).\n       The United States argues that DeCay is adequately protected from future\nlitigation by the FDCPA, and thus its failure to abide by Louisiana law is\ninconsequential. Section 3206 of the FDCPA states:\n             A person who pursuant to an execution or order issued\n             under this chapter by a court pays or delivers to the\n             United States . . . money or other personal property in\n             which a judgment debtor has or will have an interest,\n             or so pays a debt such person owes the judgment\n             debtor, is discharged from such debt to the judgment\n             debtor to the extent of the payment or delivery.\n\nThe United States thus asserts that it was not required to apply formally for a\nwithdrawal of DeCay\u2019s employee contributions because \u00a7 3206 insulates the\nLSPRF from litigation and waives DeCay\u2019s rights to any future pension benefits.\n\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\f  Case: 09-30218       Document: 00511238933          Page: 18      Date Filed: 09/20/2010\n\n                                       No. 09-30218\n\n       We conclude that LSPRF has not sufficiently established that it is\ncurrently subject to a risk of double exposure upon payment of the $77,898;11\naccordingly, the matter is not ripe for our resolution at this point.\n                                       V. Conclusion\n       We conclude that the United States may garnish the defendants\u2019\nretirement benefits to satisfy a criminal restitution order, but the CCPA limits\nthe United States\u2019 authority to garnish Barre\u2019s pension benefits to twenty-five\npercent of his monthly payment. Accordingly, we REVERSE the final orders of\ngarnishment entered against Barre, AFFIRM as to DeCay, and REMAND the\ncase to the district court for entry of final garnishment orders consistent with\nour holding in this case.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n           The United States clearly has the right to obtain the cash-out in question. The fact\nthat DeCay possessed the option to either cash-out his retirement account or wait and receive\nfuture monthly benefits allows the United States to seek an order compelling the LSPRF to\ncash-out DeCay\u2019s benefits. Cf. United States v. Nat\u2019l Bank of Commerce, 472 U.S. 713, 724-26\n(1985) (holding that the right to withdraw funds under state law is a right to property and the\nIRS may secure\u2014and thus withdraw the funds\u2014by executing a levy); Kane v. Capital\nGuardian Trust Co., 145 F.3d 1218, 1223 (10th Cir. 1998) (\u201cIn the notice of levy, the IRS\nexercised Kane\u2019s right to receive the cash value of his mutual fund shares when it directed [the\ngarnishee] to liquidate the IRA and send it the cash proceeds.\u201d); United States v.

We conclude that the United States may garnish DeCay's and Barre's retirement benefits to satisfy a criminal restitution order, but that the United States is limited to garnishing twenty-five percent of Barre's monthly pension benefit. Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court's entry of the final garnishment orders as to Barre, AFFIRM as to DeCay, and REMAND for proceedings consistent with our holding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Factual &amp; Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>Kerry DeCay and Stanford Barre pleaded guilty to one count each of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and obstruction of justice for their roles in a scheme to defraud the City of New Orleans (\"the City\"). At sentencing, the district court determined that the City had suffered an injury compensable under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\"MVRA\"), and ordered DeCay and Barre to pay $1,064,362.15, jointly and severally, in restitution. After judgment was entered, the United States moved for writs of garnishment under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act (\"FDCPA\") seeking seizure of the defendants' interests in their pension funds to satisfy the restitution order. The district court found that the statutory prerequisites to garnishment were satisfied, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3205(b), and issued the writs of garnishment to the LSPRF.</p>\n<p>The LSPRF answered the garnishment orders by stating that DeCay currently was eligible only for an immediate lump-sum withdrawal of the $77,898 he had contributed toward his retirement and that Barre was currently receiving a monthly pension benefit of $2,464.72. The LSPRF asserted that the pension benefits were exempt from seizure under federal and Louisiana law and that enforcement of the writs against it as garnishee would violate the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The LSPRF also argued that, to the extent that garnishment is proper, the United States failed to follow the appropriate formal procedures to withdraw DeCay's employee contributions. Regarding Barre, the LSPRF argued that even if garnishment were proper, the Consumer Credit Protection Act (\"CCPA\") limits the United States' right to garnish Barre's pension to twenty-five percent of his monthly benefit.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*537</span> DeCay, proceeding pro se, adopted the LSPRF's brief. Barre also objected to the writ of garnishment against him, asserting that the Tenth Amendment precludes the United States from garnishing his pension benefits and, in the alternative, that the CCPA prohibits the United States from garnishing more than twenty-five percent of his pension benefits.</p>\n<p>The district court overruled the appellants' objections to the garnishment writs and held that the United States could garnish the entire amount of DeCay's contributions to the LSPRF ($77,898), as well as the full amount of the monthly benefits paid by the LSPRF to Barre ($2,464.72). Accordingly, the district court entered final orders of garnishment compelling the LSPRF to immediately pay the United States $77,898, representing the present cash-out value of DeCay's employee contributions to the LSPRF, as well as 100% of any future distributions of pension funds due to Barre. The LSPRF and Barre filed motions for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment. DeCay adopted the LSPRF's motion. The district court denied the motions.</p>\n<p>The LSPRF, DeCay, and Barre filed the instant appeal.<sup>[1]</sup> They assert that the garnishment orders violate federal and Louisiana law, including the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The appellants argue in the alternative that, if garnishment is proper, the district court erred by not requiring the United States to complete certain formalities before withdrawing DeCay's employee contributions and by allowing the United States to garnish the full amount of Barre's monthly pension benefit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.

The United States obtained an order compelling the LSPRF to turn over funds in its possession representing any interest DeCay and Barre may have in any property subject to the LSPRF's control, thus drawing the LSPRF into the instant litigation. The writs of garnishment compel the LSPRF to take particular action, and the LSPRF asserts that the ordered action is unconstitutional under the Tenth Amendment and, as to DeCay, subjects it to potential double exposure in the future. In essence, the LSPRF is saying to the court \"you can't make me do this.\" Having been brought before the court involuntarily by another party, we conclude that the LSPRF has the ability to say it cannot be the object of such court actions.<sup>[2]</sup> Accordingly, the LSPRF, as the object of the writ of garnishment and as a sovereign entity, has standing to assert that the United States lacks the constitutional authority to compel it to release the funds.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Having concluded that the appellants possess standing to challenge the final orders of garnishment, we now turn to the merits of this dispute.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. Merits</h2>\n<p>The MVRA makes restitution mandatory for certain crimes, \"including any offense committed by fraud or deceit,\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1), (c)(1)(A)(ii), and authorizes the United States to enforce a restitution order in accordance with its civil enforcement powers.<sup>[5]</sup> The MVRA broadly permits the United States, notwithstanding any other federal law, to enforce a restitution order \"against all property or rights to property of the person fined.\" \u00a7 3613(a). Section 3613 of the MVRA sets forth several enumerated exceptions to the United States' authority to garnish any and all of the debtor's property to satisfy a restitution order; however, the statute does not exempt state-run pension plans.<sup>[6]</sup> Further, \u00a7 3613(a)(2) explicitly states that the exemptions contained in the FDCPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3014, do not apply to the enforcement of a federal criminal judgment.</p>\n<p>The appellants collectively make three arguments why the district court erred in issuing the final garnishment orders against Barre and Decay. First, the appellants assert that the defendants' pension benefits are exempt from garnishment under federal and state law. Second, Barre argues that, if the United States may garnish his retirement benefits, the CCPA limits the United States to garnishment of twenty-five percent of his monthly pension benefits. Third, the LSPRF, joined by DeCay, asserts that, if the United States is allowed to garnish Decay's contributions into his retirement, the United States is required to apply for a withdrawal of DeCay's employee contributions. We address each of these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Garnishment of Pension Benefits Under the MVRA</h2>\n<p>The appellants assert that the United States may not garnish pension benefits under the MVRA because (1) \u00a7 401(a)(13) of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") makes pension benefits inalienable; (2) the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution precludes the United States <span class=\"star-pagination\">*540</span> from garnishing pension funds controlled by the LSPRF; and (3) Louisiana constitutional and statutory law exempt pension benefits from garnishment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. IRC \u00a7 401(a)(13)</h2>\n<p>The LSPRF argues that the defendants' pension benefits are exempt from garnishment because the IRC prohibits the assignment or alienation of retirement benefits. I.R.C. \u00a7 401(a)(13)(A). Section 401(a)(13)(A) states that \"[a] trust shall not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which such trust is a part provides that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\" This circuit has never addressed whether \u00a7 3613(a) of the MVRA overrides \u00a7 401(a)(13) of the IRC.</p>\n<p>Section 3613(a) of the MVRA states that \"<i>Notwithstanding any other Federal law</i>... a judgment imposing a fine may be enforced against all property or rights to property of the person fined.\" (emphasis added). This language is qualified only by the enumerated exceptions contained in \u00a7 3613(a)(1)-(3). We conclude that the language in \u00a7 3613(a) authorizing the United States to enforce a garnishment order against \"all property or rights to property\" of the debtor, \"[n]otwithstanding any other Federal law,\" is sufficient to override the anti-alienation provision of the IRC. Several factors compel us to conclude that the MVRA allows garnishment of a defendant's retirement benefits to satisfy a criminal restitution order.</p>\n<p>First, the Supreme Court has recognized that the use of a \"notwithstanding\" clause signals Congressional intent to supersede conflicting provisions of any other statute. <i>Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112852\"><a href=\"/opinion/112852/cisneros-v-alpine-ridge-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112852\"><a href=\"/opinion/112852/cisneros-v-alpine-ridge-group/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span> (1993) (\"[T]he use of such a `notwithstanding' clause clearly signals the drafter's intention that the provisions of the `notwithstanding' section override conflicting provisions of any other section. Likewise, the Courts of Appeals generally have interpreted similar `notwithstanding' language ... to supersede all other laws, stating that a clearer statement is difficult to imagine.\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The appellants argue that the \"notwithstanding\" clause is insufficient to override the anti-alienation language in \u00a7 401(a)(13) of the IRC under the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112353\"><a href=\"/opinion/112353/guidry-v-sheet-metal-workers-nat-pension-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112353\"><a href=\"/opinion/112353/guidry-v-sheet-metal-workers-nat-pension-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span> (1990). In <i>Guidry,</i> the Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether \u00a7 501(b) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (\"LMRDA\")\u0097which provided pension funds with a private right of action to \"recover damages or secure an accounting or other appropriate relief for the benefit of the labor organizations\"\u0097 allowed the government to create a constructive trust on a defendant's pension benefits. The Court held that the \"other appropriate relief\" language in the LMRDA was insufficient to override the anti-alienation provision in \u00a7 206(d) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"). <i>Id.</i> at 375-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112353\"><a href=\"/opinion/112353/guidry-v-sheet-metal-workers-nat-pension-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, we agree with our sister circuit that \"it appears that Congress accepted the Supreme Court's invitation in <i>Guidry</i> by enacting the [MVRA].\" <i>United States</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*541</span> <i>v.

Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that Congress exempted certain retirement plans from garnishment under the MVRA, <i>see</i> \u00a7 3613(a)(1) (incorporating the exemptions in IRC \u00a7 6334(a)(6) for certain federal annuity and pension payments), but did not include state-run pension plans in the list. <i>Cf. </i><i>Waggoner v.

The only property exempt from garnishment under \u00a7 3613(a) is property that the government cannot seize to satisfy the payment of federal income taxes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a). Section 3613(c) underscores the Congressional directive that restitution orders should be satisfied in the same manner as tax liabilities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(c) (stating that an order of restitution imposed under this chapter \"is a lien in favor of the United States on all property and rights to property of the person fined <i>as if the liability of the person fined were a liability for a tax assessed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986</i>\") (emphasis added). As we have already recognized, pension plan benefits are subject to levy under the IRC to collect unpaid taxes. <i>See </i><i>Shanbaum v.

Moreover, \u00a7 3613(c) [of the MVRA] demands that criminal fines in favor of the United States should be enforced in the same manner as a tax liability would be enforced.\").</p>\n<p>Third, other circuit and district courts have concluded that the United States may garnish a defendant's pension benefits to satisfy a restitution order, despite similar anti-alienation language contained in \u00a7 206(d) of ERISA. <i>See </i><i>Irving,</i> 452 F.3d at 126; <i>Novak,</i> 476 F.3d at 1053; <i>United States v.

Section 206(d) of ERISA states: \"Each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1).

The Tenth Amendment</h2>\n<p>The appellants also argue that the garnishment writs violate the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

We reject the appellants' Tenth Amendment argument.</p>\n<p>The Tenth Amendment declares that \"powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" U.S. CONST. amend.

The appellants argument here is misdirected. Garnishing DeCay's and Barre's pension benefits has no effect on Louisiana state law; rather it penalizes DeCay and Barre for violating federal law. While the LSPRF is implicated as a garnishee, its pension system is not altered by requiring the LSRPF to pay the United States, rather than the judgment-debtors. Further, to the extent that a state desires to participate in the management of pension benefits, it must submit to federal criminal and civil laws allowing for debt-collection measures. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3003(d) (stating that the FDCPA \"shall preempt State law to the extent such law is inconsistent with a provision of this chapter\"). The federal government's inability to garnish state-run pension benefits would substantially impair the effectiveness of the FDCPA and MVRA. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

The CCPA's Limitation on Garnishment of Disposable Earnings</h2>\n<p>The LSPRF and Barre assert that, even if Barre's retirement benefits are subject to garnishment, the United States cannot garnish more than twenty-five percent of Barre's monthly pension benefits under \u00a7 303 of the CCPA. Section 3613(a)(3) of the MVRA states that the protections of the CCPA shall apply to enforcement of the judgment under either federal or state law. The CCPA provides that</p>\n<blockquote>the maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual for any workweek which is subjected to garnishment may not exceed</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) 25 per centum of his disposable earnings for that week, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) the amount by which his disposable earnings for that week exceed thirty times the Federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by section 206(a)(1) of Title 29 in effect at the time the earnings are payable,</blockquote>\n<blockquote>whichever is less. In the case of earnings for any pay period other than a week, the Secretary of Labor shall by regulation prescribe a multiple of the Federal minimum hourly wage equivalent in effect to that set forth in paragraph (2).</blockquote>\n<p>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673(a).</p>\n<p>The parties dispute whether Barre's monthly benefit payments constitute \"earnings\" under the CCPA. The CCPA defines \"earnings\" as \"compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus, or otherwise, and <i>includes periodic payments pursuant to a pension or retirement program.\"</i> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1672(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has cautioned that the terms \"earnings\" and \"disposable earnings\" under the CCPA are \"limited to `periodic payments of compensation and (do) not pertain to every asset that is traceable in some way to such compensation.'\" <i>Kokoszka v. Belford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109073\"><a href=\"/opinion/109073/kokoszka-v-belford/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 651, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109073\"><a href=\"/opinion/109073/kokoszka-v-belford/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Here, the question is whether payments made from an employer's retirement program to an employee are too attenuated to be considered \"earnings\" under the CCPA.</p>\n<p>The district courts around the country have divided over whether monthly pension-benefit payments constitute \"earnings\" under the CCPA. Several district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*544</span> courts have concluded that \"once passed to a retirement account or annuity in the hands of the employee, the funds in the account or annuity are not `earnings' under the CCPA, and thus not subject to the 25% cap, even if they are distributed in periodic payments\u0097in other words, the distributions from the fund to the defendant are not `disposable earnings' under \u00a7 303.\" <i>United States v. Belan,</i> No. 2:07-x-50979, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2444496</span></span>, at *3 (E.D.Mich.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">707</span></a></span>, 713-14 (E.D.Va. 2004). However, at least one district court has reached the opposite conclusion and held that periodic payments of retirement benefits are \"earnings\" under the CCPA. <i>McClanahan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1455698</span></span>, at *3 (holding that \"under clear statutory language, it appears that the Government may garnish only 25% of the Defendant's pension\").</p>\n<p>We find the statutory language unambiguous and hold that the United States may garnish only twenty-five percent of Barre's monthly pension benefits. The statute explicitly defines \"earnings\" to include \"periodic payments made <i>pursuant to</i> a pension or retirement program.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1672(a) (emphasis added). The term \"pursuant to\" is generally defined as \"in compliance with; in accordance with; under [or] ... as authorized by ... [or] in carrying out.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (8th ed.2004).<sup>[9]</sup> The parties do not dispute the terms of the pension plan or that the plan entitles Barre to monthly pension-benefit payments. Because the United States does not dispute that the terms of the pension plan authorize Barre to receive monthly pension benefits, we conclude that the payments are being made \"pursuant to\" the pension fund and therefore constitute \"earnings\" under the CCPA.<sup>[10]</sup> Accordingly, we conclude that the United States may not garnish more than twenty-five percent of Barre's monthly pension benefits under the CCPA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Formalities of DeCay's Cash-Out</h2>\n<p>Finally, the LSPRF asserts that the district court erred by allowing the United States to cash-out DeCay's contributions to his retirement account without applying for a refund. The LSPRF asserts that the garnishment order as to DeCay is either <span class=\"star-pagination\">*545</span> improper or incomplete because the United States did not apply for a withdrawal of DeCay's benefits. The final garnishment order issued by the district court compels the LSPRF to \"immediately pay to the United States of America the amount of $77,898.00, which represents the present cash-out value of DeCay's pension account with the LSPRF.\"</p>\n<p>The parties do not dispute that DeCay is currently entitled to cash-out his employee contributions, and the LSPRF does not suggest that DeCay's right to cash-out his contributions is in any way conditional. Instead, the LSPRF asserts that the United States must apply for a refund of DeCay's contributions because the LSPRF may be subject to future liability if the United States is not forced to execute paperwork waiving DeCay's future pension benefits. Louisiana law requires a pension beneficiary to apply for a reimbursement of his employee contributions, thereby extinguishing the employee's rights in the pension fund. <i>See</i> LA.REV.STAT. ANN. \u00a7 11:2175(C)(1) (1995) (stating that an eligible member \"may apply for and obtain a refund of the amount of his contributions by making application on the form furnished by the fund ... A refund automatically cancels all rights in the fund\").</p>\n<p>The United States argues that DeCay is adequately protected from future litigation by the FDCPA, and thus its failure to abide by Louisiana law is inconsequential. Section 3206 of the FDCPA states:</p>\n<blockquote>A person who pursuant to an execution or order issued under this chapter by a court pays or delivers to the United States ... money or other personal property in which a judgment debtor has or will have an interest, or so pays a debt such person owes the judgment debtor, is discharged from such debt to the judgment debtor to the extent of the payment or delivery.</blockquote>\n<p>The United States thus asserts that it was not required to apply formally for a withdrawal of DeCay's employee contributions because \u00a7 3206 insulates the LSPRF from litigation and waives DeCay's rights to any future pension benefits.</p>\n<p>We conclude that LSPRF has not sufficiently established that it is currently subject to a risk of double exposure upon payment of the $77,898;<sup>[11]</sup> accordingly, the matter is not ripe for our resolution at this point.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We conclude that the United States may garnish the defendants' retirement benefits to satisfy a criminal restitution order, but the CCPA limits the United States' authority to garnish Barre's pension benefits to twenty-five percent of his monthly payment. Accordingly, we REVERSE the final orders of garnishment entered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*546</span> against Barre, AFFIRM as to DeCay, and REMAND the case to the district court for entry of final garnishment orders consistent with our holding in this case.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The LSPRF timely filed an appeal from the final orders of garnishment entered against DeCay and Barre. Barre timely appealed the final order of garnishment entered against him. DeCay filed a notice of appeal from the denial of his adopted motion for a new trial or to alter or amend the judgment.</p>\n<p>[2]  Of course whether LSPRF has standing to make the argument is distinct from whether the argument has merit, a matter we address later.</p>\n<p>[3]  The LSPRF's position in this case is similar to that of a garnishee asserting that the district court lacks personal jurisdiction over it or a foreign garnishee asserting immunity as a defense to the garnishment order. We have never held that a garnishee in either of those situations lacks standing to object to the garnishment proceeding. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>FG Hemisphere Assocs., LLC v. Republique du Congo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795095\"><a href=\"/opinion/795095/fg-hemisphere-associates-llc-v-the-republique-du-congo-cms-nomeco-congo/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 584 (5th Cir.2006) (\"The sovereign immunity claim may be raised by a garnishee as well as a foreign sovereign.\"); <i>Stena Rederi AB v. Comision de Contratos del Comite Ejecutivo Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554046\"><a href=\"/opinion/554046/stena-rederi-ab-a-swedish-corporation-v-comision-de-contratos-del-comite/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">380</span></a></span>, 391-92 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over the garnishee and that the garnishee, as an agency of a foreign state, was \"entitled to invoke the shield of sovereign immunity, whether against direct claims or an indirect writ of garnishment\").</p>\n<p>[4]  Because of our conclusion that the double exposure question is not ripe, <i>see infra</i> at Section IV.C., we do not decide whether LSPRF has standing to urge its argument that the court's order subjects it to double exposure.</p>\n<p>[5]  The FDCPA sets forth the civil enforcement procedures used by the United States to recover monies owed under a restitution order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001(a)(1).</p>\n<p>[6]  The MVRA incorporates most of the exemptions contained in \u00a7 6334(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, which exempts particular property from levy for payment of federal taxes. The only \u00a7 6334 exemption relevant to pension plans applies to four types of federally authorized pension plans, including Railroad Retirement Act pensions, Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act pensions, and pensions received by certain military-service persons. I.R.C. \u00a7 6334(a)(6). None of these exemptions are applicable to the pension benefit plan at issue in the instant case.</p>\n<p>[7]  It is also undisputed that Congress had the authority to convict Barre and DeCay of the predicate crimes underlying the restitution order. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Brumley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"742602\"><a href=\"/opinion/742602/united-states-v-michael-bryant-brumley/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span>, 730 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding that the Commerce Clause supports the mail fraud criminal statute).</p>\n<p>[8]  The parties submitted letters briefing the impact of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Comstock</i> on the instant case. <i>See</i> FED. R.APP. P. 28(j). We agree with the Government that <i>Comstock</i> supports a conclusion that Congress properly exercised its authority to enact the MVRA making restitution mandatory for particular crimes and that, pursuant to this authority, the United States may garnish a defendant's state pension benefits.</p>\n<p>[9]  We observe that the cases cited by the United States misquote the statutory language defining \"earnings\" in concluding that payments <i>to</i> a pension fund are earnings, whereas payments <i>from</i> a pension fund are not. Those cases mistakenly quote the statutory definition of earnings as limited to \"periodic payments <i>to</i> a pension or retirement program.\" <i>See </i><i>Belan,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2444496</span></span>, at *3, <i>Laws,</i> 352 F.Supp.2d at 713; <i>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2138915\"><a href=\"/opinion/2138915/aetna-cas-and-sur-co-v-rodco-autobody/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 109 (D.Mass. 1996). We conclude that the \"pursuant to\" phrase includes periodic payments <i>from</i> the pension fund to the employee if the payments are being made in accordance with the terms of the plan.</p>\n<p>[10]  Our conclusion is also consistent with the legislative history and Congressional intent behind the passage of \u00a7 303 of the CCPA. In passing the CCPA, Congress was attempting to combat the problems of unemployment and bankruptcy that frequently resulted from the unrestricted garnishment of a debtor's wages. H.R.REP. NO. 1040, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968), <i>reprinted in</i> 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1962, 1979. The Committee explicitly recognized that unrestricted garnishment of a debtor's wages frequently resulted in \"a disruption of employment, production, and consumption,\" harming the debtor and interstate commerce. <i>Id.</i> at 1063. Retirement benefits, like wages, are intended to provide a \"continued means of support\" and subsistence for a judgment-debtor and his family. Congress incorporated \u00a7 303 of the CCPA into the MVRA, recognizing that the purpose of a restitution order would be thwarted if it simultaneously turned the judgment-debtor into a ward of the state and denied the debtor the ability to \"insure a continued means of support\" for him and his family.</p>\n<p>[11]  The United States clearly has the right to obtain the cash-out in question. The fact that DeCay possessed the option to either cash-out his retirement account or wait and receive future monthly benefits allows the United States to seek an order compelling the LSPRF to cash-out DeCay's benefits. <i>Cf. </i><i>United States v.
