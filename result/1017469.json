Shabazz seeks to appeal from the district\n\ncourt\u2019s order denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2254 (2000).     The order is not appealable unless a circuit\n\njustice or judge issues a certificate of appealability.    28 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue\n\nabsent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\n\nright.\u201d   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000).   A prisoner satisfies this\n\nstandard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that\n\nthe district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims is\n\ndebatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the\n\ndistrict court are also debatable or wrong.
