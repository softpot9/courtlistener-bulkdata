After his conviction was affirmed on appeal, he filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. Pagan then filed several additional motions, including a motion to be released on bond until the district court resolved the section 2255 motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court denied these motions and ordered the government to respond to the section 2255 motion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Pagan appealed and the district court denied a COA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court questioned its jurisdiction because the appealed orders were entered before a final order on the merits of the section 2255 motion. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291; <i>Pitney Bowes, Inc. v.

After the parties responded to the question, the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction with respect to all of the district court's rulings except the one denying bond. The jurisdictional question on that issue was carried with the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A COA is usually a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal in a post-conviction relief proceeding following a state or federal court conviction. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1); <i>Edwards v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741177\"><a href=\"/opinion/741177/anthony-edwards-v-united-states-of-america-eduardo-ferrufino-v-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span>, 1084-85 (11th Cir.1997). Section 2253, in relevant part, provides that \"an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from ... the final order in a proceeding under section 2255\" unless a COA has been issued. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1)(B). A COA is thus required when an order is \"the final order\" in a section 2255 proceeding. In most cases, the district court's order granting or denying post-conviction relief will be the final order. A defendant obviously must have a COA to appeal that order. The question in this case, however, is whether an order denying bond, which the district court entered before resolving the section 2255 motion, should be deemed to be \"the final order\" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(1)(B). The answer turns on the application of the collateral order doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Midland Asphalt Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></a></span> (1989), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the collateral order doctrine established in <i>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> is a \"narrow exception\" to the normal application of the final judgment rule. To fall within the limited class of collateral orders that are deemed final, the order must (1) conclusively determine the disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment. <i>Id.</i> at 799, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112226\"><a href=\"/opinion/112226/midland-asphalt-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1494</span></a></span>. Although this Court has not directly addressed whether an order denying or granting bond in a post-conviction relief proceeding is immediately appealable, it has reviewed an order granting bail to a federal prisoner whose post-conviction relief proceeding was unresolved, without commenting on the collateral order doctrine issue. <i>See Gomez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538931\"><a href=\"/opinion/538931/leonardo-botero-gomez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1990). The circuits that have addressed the precise question are split on the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We join the majority of circuits, and agree with the well reasoned analysis in <i>Dotson v. Clark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539236\"><a href=\"/opinion/539236/frederick-leon-dotson-v-jj-clark-warden-memphis-federal-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 78-9 (6th Cir.1990). A decision on whether to grant bond to a prisoner while the merits of his claim are being considered in a post-conviction relief proceeding meets all three elements for a final collateral order. First, the bond order conclusively resolves the disputed question because no further action on the bond issue can be taken in district court. <i>Id.</i> at 78. Second, it can be severed from the merits of the post-conviction relief proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Third, \"[i]f there is no interlocutory review ... the order denying bail is forever unreviewable.\" <i>Grune v. Coughlin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547471\"><a href=\"/opinion/547471/jeffrey-grune-v-thomas-a-coughlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 44 (2nd Cir.1990) (citing <i>Dotson</i>). Waiting for a final order on the merits would prevent appellate review of the bond decision because any decision on the merits renders moot the issue of whether a prisoner is entitled to be released pending resolution of the post-conviction relief proceeding. <i>See Dotson,</i> 900 F.2d at 78. We thus hold that a bond order is a collateral and final determination of a prisoner's right to be released during the pendency of a post-conviction relief proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding that the district court's order denying bond is a final appealable order under the collateral order doctrine necessarily leads us to conclude that Pagan must have a COA to proceed on appeal. The collateral order doctrine is not an exception to the requirement of finality. <i>See Cohen,</i> 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1226 (\"We hold this order appealable because it is a final disposition of a claim right....\"). The order at issue here is the final order in a proceeding under section 2255 as to bond. A COA is therefore a jurisdictional prerequisite for review of the district court's bond order. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Pagan a COA. We may construe the notice of appeal as containing a request for one. Fed. R.App.P. 22(b); <i>Edwards,</i> 114 F.3d at 1084. A COA may issue only if the applicant has made a \"substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253(c)(2). After reviewing the briefs and the record, we conclude that Pagan has failed to make this requisite showing. We therefore deny a COA and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DISMISSED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Honorable Paul C.

We\n\nhold the collateral order doctrine permits interlocutory review of a bond order in a\n\npending post-conviction relief proceeding, but dismiss the appeal for lack of\n\njurisdiction because Appellant Robert Pagan has failed to obtain a certificate of\n\nappealability (\u201cCOA\u201d).\n\n       Pagan is presently incarcerated in federal prison for armed bank robbery and\n\nuse of a firearm during a crime of violence. After his conviction was affirmed on\n\nappeal, he filed a motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255,\n\nalleging ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal.

The\n\njurisdictional question on that issue was carried with the case.\n\n      A COA is usually a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal in a post-\n\nconviction relief proceeding following a state or federal court conviction. See 28\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2253 (c)(1); Edwards v. United States, 114 F.3d 1083, 1084-85 (11th Cir.\n\n1997). Section 2253, in relevant part, provides that \u201can appeal may not be taken to\n\nthe court of appeals from . . . the final order in a proceeding under section 2255\u201d\n\nunless a COA has been issued. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72253 (c)(1)(B). A COA is thus\n\nrequired when an order is \u201cthe final order\u201d in a section 2255 proceeding. In most\n\ncases, the district court\u2019s order granting or denying post-conviction relief will be\n\nthe final order. A defendant obviously must have a COA to appeal that order. The\n\nquestion in this case, however, is whether an order denying bond, which the\n\ndistrict court entered before resolving the section 2255 motion, should be deemed\n\n                                          3\n\fto be \u201cthe final order\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 (c)(1)(B). The\n\nanswer turns on the application of the collateral order doctrine.\n\n       In Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 798, 109 S. Ct.\n\n1494, 1498 (1989), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the collateral order doctrine\n\nestablished in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corporation3 is a \u201cnarrow\n\nexception\u201d to the normal application of the final judgment rule. To fall within the\n\nlimited class of collateral orders that are deemed final, the order must (1)\n\nconclusively determine the disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue\n\ncompletely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) be effectively\n\nunreviewable on appeal from the final judgment. Id. at 799. Although this Court\n\nhas not directly addressed whether an order denying or granting bond in a post-\n\nconviction relief proceeding is immediately appealable, it has reviewed an order\n\ngranting bail to a federal prisoner whose post-conviction relief proceeding was\n\nunresolved, without commenting on the collateral order doctrine issue. See Gomez\n\nv. United States, 899 F.2d 1124 (11th Cir. 1990). The circuits that have addressed\n\nthe precise question are split on the issue.4\n\n       3\n           337 U.S. 541, 69 S. Ct. 1221 (1949).\n       4\n        Several circuits have ruled that these bond orders are immediately appealable. See\nMartin v. Solem, 801 F.2d 324 (8th Cir. 1986); Cherek v. United States, 767 F.2d 335 (7th Cir.\n1985); Dotson v. Clark, 900 F.2d 77 (6th Cir. 1990); United States v. Smith, 835 F.2d 1048 (3rd\nCir. 1987); Grune v. Coughlin, 913 F. 2d 41 (2nd Cir. 1990); Guerra v. Meese, 786 F.2d 414\n\n                                                  4\n\f       We join the majority of circuits, and agree with the well reasoned analysis in\n\nDotson v. Clark, 900 F.2d 77, 78-9 (6th Cir. 1990). A decision on whether to grant\n\nbond to a prisoner while the merits of his claim are being considered in a post-\n\nconviction relief proceeding meets all three elements for a final collateral order.\n\nFirst, the bond order conclusively resolves the disputed question because no\n\nfurther action on the bond issue can be taken in district court. Id. at 78. Second, it\n\ncan be severed from the merits of the post-conviction relief proceeding.5 Third,\n\n\u201c[i]f there is no interlocutory review . . . the order denying bail is forever\n\nunreviewable.\u201d Grune v. Coughlin, 913 F.2d 41, 44 (2nd Cir. 1990) (citing\n\nDotson). Waiting for a final order on the merits would prevent appellate review of\n\nthe bond decision because any decision on the merits renders moot the issue of\n\nwhether a prisoner is entitled to be released pending resolution of the post-\n\nconviction relief proceeding. See Dotson, 900 F.2d at 78. We thus hold that a\n\nbond order is a collateral and final determination of a prisoner\u2019s right to be\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1986). The First and Ninth Circuits have declined to hold the denial of a bond\nimmediately appealable, but have construed such an appeal as a petition for writ of mandamus.\nLand v. Deeds, 878 F.2d 318 (9th Cir. 1989); United States v. DiRusso, 548 F.2d 372 (1st Cir.\n1976). We note that Grune, Dotson and Land are section 2254 cases. For purposes of this issue,\nhowever, the analysis is the same in the section 2254 context as it is in the section 2255 context.\n       5\n         The Sixth Circuit acknowledged that \u201cthere is some merit to the argument that these bail\ndecisions are often inextricably entwined with the merits,\u201d but concluded that \u201c[a] person\u2019s right\nto liberty pending disposition of his case on the merits is (somewhat) distinct from the merits.\u201d\nDotson, 900 F.2d at 78. We agree that the issues are sufficiently distinct to satisfy the second\nelement of the collateral order doctrine analysis.\n\n                                                 5\n\freleased during the pendency of a post-conviction relief proceeding.\n\n       Our holding that the district court\u2019s order denying bond is a final appealable\n\norder under the collateral order doctrine necessarily leads us to conclude that\n\nPagan must have a COA to proceed on appeal. The collateral order doctrine is not\n\nan exception to the requirement of finality. See Cohen, 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S. Ct.\n\nat 1226 (\u201cWe hold this order appealable because it is a final disposition of a claim\n\nright . . . .\u201d). The order at issue here is the final order in a proceeding under\n\nsection 2255 as to bond. A COA is therefore a jurisdictional prerequisite for\n\nreview of the district court\u2019s bond order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.6\n\n       The district court denied Pagan a COA. We may construe the notice of\n\nappeal as containing a request for one. Fed. R. App. P. 22(b); Edwards, 114 F.3d\n\nat 1084. A COA may issue only if the applicant has made a \u201csubstantial showing\n\nof the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 (c)(2). After reviewing\n\nthe briefs and the record, we conclude that Pagan has failed to make this requisite\n\nshowing. We therefore deny a COA and dismiss the appeal for lack of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n       DISMISSED.\n\n\n       6\n        We note that to hold otherwise would frustrate the principle function of the COA\nrequirement, which is to serve as a threshold test to screen out frivolous appeals in post-\nconviction relief proceedings. See Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 337, 123 S. Ct. 1029,\n1040 (2003).\n\n                                                6\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "353 F.3d 1343", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 13, "CL_opinion_sha1": "fc155d32897406130bf644066d215c6fd17b3b8b", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/104695/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112226/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/122258/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/342413/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/415406/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/454851/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/466411/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/476369/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/499065/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/525359/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/538931/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/539236/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/547471/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/741177/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2010-04-26T23:58:35Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 6, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/76399/pagan-v-united-states/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "76399", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "353 F.3d 1343 (December 23,2003)", "CL_opinion_local_path": "pdf/2003/12/23/Pagan_v._USA.pdf", "LDA_Model_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_cluster": {"state_cite_two": "", "date_blocked": null, "syllabus": "", "posture": "", "federal_cite_one": "353 F.3d 1343", "case_name_short": "Pagan", "date_filed": "2003-12-23", "federal_cite_two": "", "docket": {"court": {"has_opinion_scraper": true, "in_use": true, "url": "http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/", "start_date": "1980-10-14", "full_name": "Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit", "date_modified": "2013-08-14T16:46:30Z", "position": 111.0, "jurisdiction": "F", "has_oral_argument_scraper": false, "resource_uri": "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/courts/ca11/", "citation_string": "11th Cir.", "short_name": "Eleventh Circuit", "end_date": null}, "date_blocked": null, "filepath_ia": null, "docket_number": "02-12397", "date_argued": null, "date_reargued": null, "cause": null, "case_name_short": "Pagan", "date_filed": null, "filepath_local": null, "date_cert_denied": null, "source": 0, "assigned_to": null, "clusters": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/76399/"], "jurisdiction_type": null, "audio_files": [], "date_reargument_denied": null, "date_terminated": null, "case_name_full": "", "date_created": "2014-10-30T06:24:38.279002Z", "slug": "pagan-v-united-states", "nature_of_suit": null, "date_modified": "2014-10-30T06:24:38.279002Z", "date_cert_granted": null, "jury_demand": null, "blocked": false, "case_name": "Pagan v.
