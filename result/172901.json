Respondent-appellee the United States (\u201crespondent\u201d) contends that under\n\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), we lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019\n\nmotion to reopen. We agree with respondent and therefore DISMISS the petitions for\n\nwant of jurisdiction.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Petitioners are citizens of Mexico and have two children, aged sixteen and thirteen,\n\nwho are both citizens of the United States. Mr. Nunez-Rodarte has lived in the United\n\nStates unlawfully since 1986; his wife began living here sometime after July 1991. On\n\nJuly 2, 2001, the United States placed petitioners in removal proceedings. Thereafter,\n\npetitioners applied for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b, which provides for\n\ndiscretionary cancellation of removal when an alien demonstrates that: (1) he has been\n\nphysically and continuously present in the United States in the ten years preceding their\n\napplication; (2) he has been a person of good moral character during such period; (3) he\n\nhas not been convicted of certain criminal offenses; and (4) \u201cremoval would result in\n\nexceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is\n\na citizen of the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 240A(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1).\n\n       On October 15, 2007, the Immigration Law Judge (\u201cILJ\u201d) found that petitioners\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fhad failed to establish the fourth requirement under the statute.1 Specifically, the ILJ\n\nfound that the children would suffer by returning with petitioners to an unfamiliar culture\n\nin Mexico, but that this hardship would not be exceptional or extremely unusual. The ILJ\n\nnoted that the children did not have any other family or support system in the United\n\nStates and that the only hardship they would experience is a lack of educational and\n\neconomic opportunities.\n\n       Petitioners appealed to the BIA. On July 25, 2008, the BIA dismissed the appeal,\n\nagreeing with the ILJ that petitioners had failed to meet their burden of proof to establish\n\nextreme and unusual hardship to their United States citizen children. On October 15,\n\n2008, petitioners filed a motion to reopen the BIA\u2019s July 25 decision in order to present\n\nnew evidence supporting their claim of hardship. On January 5, 2009, the BIA denied the\n\nmotion to reopen, stating that \u201c[t]he new facts alleged regarding the . . . children\u2019s\n\neducational difficulties, together with the facts already of record, do not indicate a\n\nreasonable likelihood of success on the merits regarding the issue of exceptional and\n\nextremely unusual hardship so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues at a\n\nhearing.\u201d\n\n       Petitioners now seek judicial review to contest the BIA\u2019s January 5 denial of their\n\nmotion to reopen. They argue that the BIA: (1) ignored relevant precedent in determining\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The ILJ also found that Mr. Nunez-Rodarte\u2019s wife had failed to demonstrate the\nfirst requirement, but this issue is not relevant to these appeals.\n\n                                             -3-\n\fwhether they had satisfied the hardship requirement; and (2) failed to articulate the basis\n\nfor its decision in anything other than \u201cconclusory statements.\u201d\n\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\n       As respondent makes clear, the threshold issue is whether we have jurisdiction to\n\nconsider the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)\n\nprovides that \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, . . . no court shall have\n\njurisdiction to review . . . any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section . . .\n\n1229b . . . of this title.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). This provision precludes jurisdiction\n\nto review the BIA\u2019s denial of an application for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 240A of\n\nthe INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. See Alvarez-Delmuro v.

This\n\nprovision also applies to a denial of a motion to reopen that is based on a finding that\n\npetitioners\u2019 new evidence did not support a finding of exceptional and extremely unusual\n\nhardship. See Alzainati v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172284\"><a href=\"/opinion/172284/alzainati-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201cBecause\n\n\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I) precludes our review of an \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual\n\nhardship\u2019 determination under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D), it also precludes our jurisdiction to\n\nreview the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen because the alien still has failed to show\n\nthe requisite hardship.\u201d). Thus, to the extent petitioners challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of\n\ntheir motion to reopen based on its determination that they had not shown that their\n\nremoval would cause their United States children to suffer exceptional and extremely\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\funusual hardship, we must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       We do, however, have jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims or questions of\n\nlaw, INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), but only insofar as such issues are\n\n\u201ccolorable.\u201d Alvarez-Delmuro, 360 F.3d at 1256\u201357; Morales Ventura, 348 F.3d at 1262.\n\nPetitioners suggest that the BIA ignored applicable case law and failed to consider\n\nrelevant facts, but we conclude these issues are not subject to review. To the extent these\n\nissues are couched in terms of due process, we have recognized the rule that \u201c\u2018an alien\n\nhas no constitutionally-protected right to discretionary relief or to be eligible for\n\ndiscretionary relief.\u2019\u201d United States v. Aguirre-Tello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784626\"><a href=\"/opinion/784626/united-states-v-ricardo-aguirre-tello/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1205 (10th Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting Oguejiofor v.

We thus\n\nconclude petitioners have not raised colorable constitutional or legal questions and must\n\ndismiss the petitions for lack of jurisdiction on those grounds as well.\n\n                                    III.

We agree with respondent and therefore DISMISS the petitions for\n\nwant of jurisdiction.\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n       Petitioners are citizens of Mexico and have two children, aged sixteen and thirteen,\n\nwho are both citizens of the United States. Mr. Nunez-Rodarte has lived in the United\n\nStates unlawfully since 1986; his wife began living here sometime after July 1991. On\n\nJuly 2, 2001, the United States placed petitioners in removal proceedings. Thereafter,\n\npetitioners applied for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b, which provides for\n\ndiscretionary cancellation of removal when an alien demonstrates that: (1) he has been\n\nphysically and continuously present in the United States in the ten years preceding their\n\napplication; (2) he has been a person of good moral character during such period; (3) he\n\nhas not been convicted of certain criminal offenses; and (4) \u201cremoval would result in\n\nexceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is\n\na citizen of the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 240A(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1).\n\n       On October 15, 2007, the Immigration Law Judge (\u201cILJ\u201d) found that petitioners\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fhad failed to establish the fourth requirement under the statute.1 Specifically, the ILJ\n\nfound that the children would suffer by returning with petitioners to an unfamiliar culture\n\nin Mexico, but that this hardship would not be exceptional or extremely unusual. The ILJ\n\nnoted that the children did not have any other family or support system in the United\n\nStates and that the only hardship they would experience is a lack of educational and\n\neconomic opportunities.\n\n       Petitioners appealed to the BIA. On July 25, 2008, the BIA dismissed the appeal,\n\nagreeing with the ILJ that petitioners had failed to meet their burden of proof to establish\n\nextreme and unusual hardship to their United States citizen children. On October 15,\n\n2008, petitioners filed a motion to reopen the BIA\u2019s July 25 decision in order to present\n\nnew evidence supporting their claim of hardship. On January 5, 2009, the BIA denied the\n\nmotion to reopen, stating that \u201c[t]he new facts alleged regarding the . . . children\u2019s\n\neducational difficulties, together with the facts already of record, do not indicate a\n\nreasonable likelihood of success on the merits regarding the issue of exceptional and\n\nextremely unusual hardship so as to make it worthwhile to develop the issues at a\n\nhearing.\u201d\n\n       Petitioners now seek judicial review to contest the BIA\u2019s January 5 denial of their\n\nmotion to reopen. They argue that the BIA: (1) ignored relevant precedent in determining\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The ILJ also found that Mr. Nunez-Rodarte\u2019s wife had failed to demonstrate the\nfirst requirement, but this issue is not relevant to these appeals.\n\n                                             -3-\n\fwhether they had satisfied the hardship requirement; and (2) failed to articulate the basis\n\nfor its decision in anything other than \u201cconclusory statements.\u201d\n\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\n       As respondent makes clear, the threshold issue is whether we have jurisdiction to\n\nconsider the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. Section 1252(a)(2)(B)\n\nprovides that \u201c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, . . . no court shall have\n\njurisdiction to review . . . any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section . . .\n\n1229b . . . of this title.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). This provision precludes jurisdiction\n\nto review the BIA\u2019s denial of an application for cancellation of removal under \u00a7 240A of\n\nthe INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. See Alvarez-Delmuro v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 1254, 1256 (10th\n\nCir. 2004); Morales Ventura v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1259, 1262 (10th Cir. 2003). This\n\nprovision also applies to a denial of a motion to reopen that is based on a finding that\n\npetitioners\u2019 new evidence did not support a finding of exceptional and extremely unusual\n\nhardship. See Alzainati v. Holder, 568 F.3d 844, 849 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201cBecause\n\n\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I) precludes our review of an \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual\n\nhardship\u2019 determination under \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D), it also precludes our jurisdiction to\n\nreview the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen because the alien still has failed to show\n\nthe requisite hardship.\u201d). Thus, to the extent petitioners challenge the BIA\u2019s denial of\n\ntheir motion to reopen based on its determination that they had not shown that their\n\nremoval would cause their United States children to suffer exceptional and extremely\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\funusual hardship, we must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       We do, however, have jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims or questions of\n\nlaw, INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), but only insofar as such issues are\n\n\u201ccolorable.\u201d Alvarez-Delmuro, 360 F.3d at 1256\u201357; Morales Ventura, 348 F.3d at 1262.\n\nPetitioners suggest that the BIA ignored applicable case law and failed to consider\n\nrelevant facts, but we conclude these issues are not subject to review. To the extent these\n\nissues are couched in terms of due process, we have recognized the rule that \u201c\u2018an alien\n\nhas no constitutionally-protected right to discretionary relief or to be eligible for\n\ndiscretionary relief.\u2019\u201d United States v. Aguirre-Tello, 353 F.3d 1199, 1205 (10th Cir.\n\n2004) (quoting Oguejiofor v. Attorney General, 277 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir. 2002)).\n\nTo the extent these issues are framed in terms of other legal questions, petitioners do not\n\nexplain how the BIA ignored relevant legal authority or what facts it ignored. We thus\n\nconclude petitioners have not raised colorable constitutional or legal questions and must\n\ndismiss the petitions for lack of jurisdiction on those grounds as well.\n\n                                    III. CONCLUSION\n\n       The petitions are DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                            ENTERED FOR THE COURT,\n\n\n\n\n                                            Deanell Reece Tacha\n                                            Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "994f35f7eb43940b694d31b577b10bff66d1e624", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/164055/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/164431/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/172284/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/776277/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/784626/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2010-08-14T18:59:32Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 7, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/172901/nunez-rodarte-v-holder-jr/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "172901", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Nunez Rodarte v.
