Introduction\n               Appellant Harold Johnson (Plaintiff) seeks review of an order of the\nCourt of Common Pleas of Delaware County (trial court)1 that granted a motion for\nsummary judgment on behalf of Appellees Ridley Park Borough (Borough) and\nBorough Police Officer Robert Quinlan (Borough Officer) (collectively, Borough\nDefendants),2 and dismissed, with prejudice, Plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint\nas to them. Plaintiff sustained injuries in March 2010, when struck by a fleeing\n\n      1\n          The Honorable Charles B. Burr, II, presided.\n\n      2\n          On appeal, Appellees Ridley Township and Donald A. Downes filed notices of non-\nparticipation. By order dated July 24, 2015, this Court precluded Appellee Rasheena Bradley\nfrom filing a brief or participating in oral argument.\n\fsuspect\u2019s vehicle in a police chase. In granting judgment for Borough Defendants,\nthe trial court determined the applicable statute of limitations barred Plaintiff\u2019s\nsecond amended complaint against them because Plaintiff filed it more than two\nyears after the date of his injuries. The trial court also determined the discovery\nrule did not apply to toll the statute of limitations because Plaintiff failed to\nexercise reasonable diligence in ascertaining the proper parties against whom to\nbring suit. The trial court further determined Plaintiff waived all issues on appeal\nby failing to serve the trial court with a copy of his Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 1925(b) Concise Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal as\nexplicitly required by the trial court\u2019s February 2, 2015 order.\n\n\n             On appeal, Plaintiff contends the trial court, in finding the discovery\nrule inapplicable in this case, usurped the jury\u2019s fact-finder role by making factual\nand credibility determinations. Further, Plaintiff asserts the trial court erred in\ndetermining he waived all issues on appeal for failure to timely serve the trial\njudge with a copy of his Rule 1925(b) Statement.\n\n\n                                  II. Background\n                           A. Vehicle Pursuit; Collision\n             On March 8, 2010, Plaintiff sustained severe injuries when Thomas\nRafferty (Suspect), a driver of a vehicle pursued by police, struck Plaintiff\u2019s\nvehicle at the intersection of Morton Avenue and Johnson Street in the City of\nChester, Delaware County. The chase began when Gerard Scanlan, a Ridley\nTownship police officer (Township Officer) observed a man and woman fighting\nin a car in a shopping center parking lot. Township Officer directed the female\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fpassenger, Kim Caruso (Suspect Passenger), to exit the vehicle. Suspect Passenger\nexited the vehicle.\n\n\n             Suspicious of drug activity, Township Officer requested that Suspect,\nthe driver, show his hands. However, Suspect refused and reached for an object\nunder the seat. Township Officer then drew his gun. Next, Suspect drove directly\nat Township Officer, striking the left side of his body. Suspect fled at a high rate\nof speed through the shopping center and eventually made a right turn onto Chester\nPike in the direction of the City of Chester. At that point, Township Officer\nradioed in the description of Suspect\u2019s vehicle.\n\n\n             Upon hearing the dispatch, Borough Officer assisted in the pursuit.\nBorough Officer passed Township Officer\u2019s SUV and proceeded behind Suspect\nfor a short-time before trying to pass and get in front of him. However, Suspect\nswerved toward Borough Officer, who backed off and slowed down.\n\n\n             As a result, Borough Officer fell back and did not see the accident\nhappen.     Nonetheless, Suspect continued down Chester Pike, which became\nMorton Avenue, at an extremely high rate of speed. Suspect entered oncoming\ntraffic on Morton Avenue and struck Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle head-on while he was\nstopped at the Johnson Street intersection. Suspect later died as a result of the\naccident.\n\n\n             Suspect\u2019s collision with Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle knocked it 67 feet\nbackward into Defendant Rasheena Bradley\u2019s parked vehicle. Plaintiff testified the\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fcrash knocked him unconscious. When he woke up, a police officer pulled him out\nof the passenger side window. See Dep. of Harold Johnson, 3/28/14 (Johnson\nDep.), at 24-25. Plaintiff could not recall the officer\u2019s municipality or uniform.\nJohnson Dep. at 25. Plaintiff sustained injuries in the crash including blunt trauma\nto the chest and abdomen. Plaintiff also sustained injuries to both feet. Thereafter,\nPlaintiff underwent several surgeries requiring the installation of plates in his right\nfoot. Johnson Dep. at 29.\n\n\n                          B. Plaintiff\u2019s Negligence Action\n             On March 6, 2012, several days prior to the expiration of the two-year\nlimitations period in 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a75524(2), Plaintiff initiated this case by writ of\nsummons.\n\n\n             Plaintiff filed a complaint in June 2012 and an amended complaint in\nJuly 2012. Plaintiff initially named Suspect, Donald Downes, owner of the car\ndriven by Suspect, Rasheena Bradley, whose vehicle Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle struck\nduring the collision, Ridley Township (Township), and two City of Chester police\nofficers. In October 2012, the trial court sustained preliminary objections filed by\nthe Chester police officers and removed their names from the caption.\n\n\n                         C. Second Amended Complaint\n             Thereafter, the trial court granted Plaintiff leave to file a second\namended complaint naming Borough Defendants. In July 2013, Plaintiff filed his\nsecond amended complaint. He served it on Borough Defendants in late August\n2013, more than three years and five months after the police pursuit and accident.\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f             In Count I, Plaintiff averred Defendants Ridley Township and Ridley\nPark Borough violated 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a76342 (written pursuit policies required) by\nfailing to create and implement a written training policy with respect to when a\npolice officer should initiate, continue, and terminate, a motor vehicle pursuit. As\na result, the Township and Borough created a danger that deprived Plaintiff of his\nsubstantive due process rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 and the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In Count II, Plaintiff averred Township and Borough Police Officers,\nunder color of state law, acted recklessly during the pursuit in violation of\nPlaintiff\u2019s substantive due process rights, 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 and the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In Count III, Plaintiff set forth a negligence claim against non-\ngovernmental Defendants Downes, Suspect and Bradley. In Count IV, Plaintiff\nagain averred Defendants Township and Borough failed to create and implement a\ntraining policy with respect to when a police officer should initiate, continue, and\nterminate, a motor vehicle pursuit. As a result, the Township and Borough created\na danger that deprived Plaintiff of his substantive due process rights in violation of\n42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n           D. Borough Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment\n                       1. Two-Year Statute of Limitations\n             In July 2014, following the close of the pleadings and discovery,\nBorough Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. Defendants asserted\nthe two-year statute of limitations for negligence actions in 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a75524(2)\nbarred Plaintiff\u2019s claims based on the March 2010 crash. To that end, Defendants\nmaintained, the statute of limitations for a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 is the\nforum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury. Sameric Corp. v. City of\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fPhila., 142 F.3d 582 (3d Cir. 1998). Thus, Borough Defendants argued Plaintiff\u2019s\nSection 1983 claims in Counts I, II and IV of Plaintiff\u2019s second amended\ncomplaint were time-barred.\n\n\n                                 2. Discovery Rule\n             Borough Defendants further averred the discovery rule, an exception\nto the traditional running of the statute of limitations, was inapplicable here. The\npurpose of the discovery rule is to exclude from the running of the statute of\nlimitations the period of time during which a plaintiff, who did not suffer an\nimmediately ascertainable injury, is reasonably unaware of his injury and what\ncaused it. Fine v. Checcio, 870 A.2d 850 (Pa. 2005).\n\n\n             When a court is presented with the assertion that the discovery rule\napplies, it must address the ability of the injured party, exercising reasonable\ndiligence, to ascertain that he was injured and by what cause. Id. Because this\nquestion involves a factual determination as to whether a party was able, in the\nexercise of reasonable diligence, to know of his injury and its cause, it is ordinarily\na matter for the jury to decide. Id. However, where reasonable minds would not\ndiffer in finding that a party knew or should have known of his injury and its cause,\nthe court may, on its own, determine the discovery rule did not apply as a matter of\nlaw. Id.\n\n\n                               3. Fraudulent Concealment\n             In addition to the discovery rule, the Supreme Court in Fine noted that\nthe doctrine of fraudulent concealment may toll the statute of limitations. This\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdoctrine is based on a theory of estoppel. It provides that a defendant may not\ninvoke the statute of limitations, if through fraud or concealment the defendant\ncauses the plaintiff to relax his vigilance or deviate from his right of inquiry into\nthe facts. Notably, however, Plaintiff never asserted the doctrine of fraudulent\nconcealment applied here.\n\n\n              4. Exceptions to Statute of Limitations Inapplicable\n             In their motion for summary judgment in the present case, Borough\nDefendants asserted the evidence produced during discovery indicated that\nPlaintiff became aware of his injuries on the day they occurred, and Plaintiff failed\nto use reasonable diligence in pursuing his claims and identifying the defendants.\nBorough Defendants also asserted they did not engage in any acts of concealment.\nConsequently, Borough Defendants argued that neither the discovery rule nor the\ndoctrine of fraudulent concealment applied in this case.\n\n                            5. Governmental Immunity\n             In addition, Borough Defendants asserted entitlement to immunity\nunder the statutory provisions commonly known as the Political Subdivision Tort\nClaims Act (Tort Claims Act). See 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a78541-42. They claimed Borough\nOfficer complied with Pennsylvania law and Borough police policy regarding\nvehicle pursuits by operating a mechanically sound vehicle with its lights and\nsirens activated.   Further, Borough Officer backed off pursuit of the fleeing\nvehicle, to the point it was no longer in sight, prior to the time of the accident.\nTherefore, Defendants argued they violated no duty to Plaintiff. See 75 Pa. C.S.\n\u00a73105 (drivers of emergency vehicles, including those in pursuit of suspected\nviolators of the law, may exercise special privileges including: proceeding through\n\n\n                                         7\n\fred traffic signals, after first slowing down as may be necessary; exceeding the\nmaximum speed limits so long as the driver does not endanger life or property;\nand, disregarding regulations governing direction or movement, overtaking\nvehicles or turning in specified directions).\n\n\n                          E. Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Motion\n               In opposition to Borough Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment,\nPlaintiff argued the discovery rule should apply. To that end, Plaintiff asserted, 10\ndays after the crash his former counsel hired a private investigator, Stephen J.\nKoerper (Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator). After visiting the accident scene, Investigator\nattempted to obtain information from the Ridley Township Police Department.\nHowever, the Township Police advised Investigator that the matter remained under\ncriminal investigation.     Thus, the Township Police only provided Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator with a report number. Further, Chester City Police Department\u2019s\ncrash report did not indicate Borough Defendants\u2019 involvement in the incident. In\nshort, nothing notified Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator of Borough Officer\u2019s involvement in\nthe pursuit.\n\n\n               After reviewing a newspaper article about the incident, Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator spoke with a witness, Louis Salerno (Witness Salerno), who recalled\nseeing a dark-colored car chased by a red Township police car (Dodge Charger).\nA Township K-9 unit (Ford Explorer) and an unmarked white car (Dodge Charger)\nfollowed behind.      Witness Salerno told Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator that all three\nvehicles were using emergency lights. Nevertheless, Salerno did not hear any\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fsirens. In addition, he did not recall seeing any Borough police vehicles (black and\nwhite patrol cars).\n\n\n              Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator also attempted to speak with Officer Harris of\nthe City of Chester City Police Department, who was unavailable and never\nresponded to Investigator\u2019s voice mail messages.                 Unable to obtain further\nresponses from the Township or City of Chester, Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator concluded\nhis investigation.\n\n\n              In July 2012, Plaintiff received an informal email from the Township\nindicating Borough Defendants\u2019 involvement in the incident. In April 2013, the\nparties held a status conference and discussed the parties\u2019 roles in the incident. In\nJuly 2013, Plaintiff received confirmation of Borough Defendants\u2019 involvement in\nthe pursuit. Plaintiff asserted the statute of limitations should run from this point.\nA week later, on July 18, 2013, Plaintiff filed his second amended complaint\nnaming the Borough and Borough Officer as defendants.\n\n\n                      F. Grant of Motion for Summary Judgment\n              In January 2015, the trial court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment and dismissed, with prejudice, Plaintiff\u2019s second amended\ncomplaint only as to Borough Defendants.3 In an opinion in support of its order,\n\n       3\n         The trial court, in its opinion in support of its order, noted that in November 2014, a\nprevious judge in the case, the Honorable G. Michael Green, granted motions for summary\njudgment on behalf of Defendant Donald Downes, the owner of the car driven by Suspect, and\nRidley Township, thereby dismissing Plaintiff\u2019s claims against them. See Tr. Ct., Slip. Op.,\n3/18/15, at 3; Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 120a.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fthe trial court determined Plaintiff\u2019s claims against Borough Defendants were\nbarred by the two-year statute of limitations.\n\n\n               In addition, the trial court determined the discovery rule is unavailing\nto Plaintiff in this case. The court noted Plaintiff merely contended that the lapse\nof time in identifying Borough Defendants resulted from an inability by Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator to obtain sufficient information during his brief one-month\ninvestigation. See Tr.

Therefore, the trial court determined Plaintiff waived all\nissues on appeal. See Tr. Ct., Slip Op., at 9-10, n.3.

Inapplicability of Discovery Rule\n               On appeal, Plaintiff contends the trial court, in finding the discovery\nrule inapplicable in this case, usurped the jury\u2019s role by making factual and\ncredibility determinations. See Fine (whether a party was able, in the exercise of\n\n\n       4\n         Our review of a trial court order granting summary judgment is limited to determining\nwhether the trial court erred as a matter of law or abused its discretion. Kuniskas v.\nCommonwealth, 977 A.2d 602 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2009). We must examine the record in a light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party, accepting as true all well-pled facts and reasonable inferences\nto be drawn from those facts.

The point at which a complaining party should reasonably\nbe aware that he suffered an injury is generally an issue for the jury. Id. Plaintiff\nasserts he first learned of Borough Defendants\u2019 involvement in the incident in a\nJuly 2012 email from Ridley Township. Therefore, Plaintiff argues, he had two\nyears from that date to name Borough Defendants.\n\n\n             Plaintiff first contends the trial court erred in concluding he should\nhave known Borough Officer attended to his injuries at the accident scene.\nContrary to the trial court\u2019s findings, Plaintiff asserts the collision rendered him\nunconscious and thus unable to identify the jurisdiction of the police officers that\nattended to him.\n\n\n             More importantly, Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in making\nthe factual determination that he unreasonably relied on the results of Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator\u2019s report, including the City of Chester crash report.            Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator obtained a crash report from the City of Chester indicating that only\nthe Chester and Township Police Departments were involved in the investigation\nof the incident.\n\n\n             In addition, Plaintiff advances a number of factual arguments in\nsupport of his assertion that the trial court erred in finding the timely availability of\na voluminous public record of information regarding the pursuit and accident.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f             In sum, although Borough Defendants\u2019 alleged various shortcomings\nin Plaintiff\u2019s and his Investigator\u2019s efforts, Plaintiff nevertheless argues a jury\nquestion exists as to whether his reliance on Investigator\u2019s efforts constituted\nreasonable diligence warranting application of the discovery rule. Fine.\n\n\n                            B. Rule 1925(b) Statement\n             Plaintiff also contends the trial court erred in finding he waived his\nappellate issues by failing to serve the court with his Rule 1925(b) Concise\nStatement of the Errors Complained of on Appeal. Plaintiff asserts the trial court\nstated it never received service and accused Plaintiff of failing to produce any\nevidence of an attempt to comply with the service requirement in Pa. R.A.P.\n1925(b)(3)(iii) despite quoting the language from Plaintiff\u2019s 1925(b) Statement.\nTherefore, Plaintiff argues: \u201cIt is unclear how the trial court could argue it never\nreceived Plaintiff\u2019s 1925(b) statement, when it quoted the exact language of the\nstatement, in its opinion.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 41.\n\n\n             Further, Plaintiff asserts, his counsel would not have included the trial\njudge in the certificate of service if he did not serve the trial judge with the\nstatement.

Introduction\n               Appellant Harold Johnson (Plaintiff) seeks review of an order of the\nCourt of Common Pleas of Delaware County (trial court)1 that granted a motion for\nsummary judgment on behalf of Appellees Ridley Park Borough (Borough) and\nBorough Police Officer Robert Quinlan (Borough Officer) (collectively, Borough\nDefendants),2 and dismissed, with prejudice, Plaintiff\u2019s second amended complaint\nas to them. Plaintiff sustained injuries in March 2010, when struck by a fleeing\n\n      1\n          The Honorable Charles B.

By order dated July 24, 2015, this Court precluded Appellee Rasheena Bradley\nfrom filing a brief or participating in oral argument.\n\fsuspect\u2019s vehicle in a police chase. In granting judgment for Borough Defendants,\nthe trial court determined the applicable statute of limitations barred Plaintiff\u2019s\nsecond amended complaint against them because Plaintiff filed it more than two\nyears after the date of his injuries. The trial court also determined the discovery\nrule did not apply to toll the statute of limitations because Plaintiff failed to\nexercise reasonable diligence in ascertaining the proper parties against whom to\nbring suit. The trial court further determined Plaintiff waived all issues on appeal\nby failing to serve the trial court with a copy of his Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 1925(b) Concise Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal as\nexplicitly required by the trial court\u2019s February 2, 2015 order.\n\n\n             On appeal, Plaintiff contends the trial court, in finding the discovery\nrule inapplicable in this case, usurped the jury\u2019s fact-finder role by making factual\nand credibility determinations. Further, Plaintiff asserts the trial court erred in\ndetermining he waived all issues on appeal for failure to timely serve the trial\njudge with a copy of his Rule 1925(b) Statement.\n\n\n                                  II. Background\n                           A. Vehicle Pursuit; Collision\n             On March 8, 2010, Plaintiff sustained severe injuries when Thomas\nRafferty (Suspect), a driver of a vehicle pursued by police, struck Plaintiff\u2019s\nvehicle at the intersection of Morton Avenue and Johnson Street in the City of\nChester, Delaware County. The chase began when Gerard Scanlan, a Ridley\nTownship police officer (Township Officer) observed a man and woman fighting\nin a car in a shopping center parking lot. Township Officer directed the female\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fpassenger, Kim Caruso (Suspect Passenger), to exit the vehicle. Suspect Passenger\nexited the vehicle.\n\n\n             Suspicious of drug activity, Township Officer requested that Suspect,\nthe driver, show his hands. However, Suspect refused and reached for an object\nunder the seat. Township Officer then drew his gun. Next, Suspect drove directly\nat Township Officer, striking the left side of his body. Suspect fled at a high rate\nof speed through the shopping center and eventually made a right turn onto Chester\nPike in the direction of the City of Chester. At that point, Township Officer\nradioed in the description of Suspect\u2019s vehicle.\n\n\n             Upon hearing the dispatch, Borough Officer assisted in the pursuit.\nBorough Officer passed Township Officer\u2019s SUV and proceeded behind Suspect\nfor a short-time before trying to pass and get in front of him. However, Suspect\nswerved toward Borough Officer, who backed off and slowed down.\n\n\n             As a result, Borough Officer fell back and did not see the accident\nhappen.     Nonetheless, Suspect continued down Chester Pike, which became\nMorton Avenue, at an extremely high rate of speed. Suspect entered oncoming\ntraffic on Morton Avenue and struck Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle head-on while he was\nstopped at the Johnson Street intersection. Suspect later died as a result of the\naccident.\n\n\n             Suspect\u2019s collision with Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle knocked it 67 feet\nbackward into Defendant Rasheena Bradley\u2019s parked vehicle. Plaintiff testified the\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fcrash knocked him unconscious. When he woke up, a police officer pulled him out\nof the passenger side window. See Dep. of Harold Johnson, 3/28/14 (Johnson\nDep.), at 24-25. Plaintiff could not recall the officer\u2019s municipality or uniform.\nJohnson Dep. at 25. Plaintiff sustained injuries in the crash including blunt trauma\nto the chest and abdomen. Plaintiff also sustained injuries to both feet. Thereafter,\nPlaintiff underwent several surgeries requiring the installation of plates in his right\nfoot. Johnson Dep. at 29.\n\n\n                          B. Plaintiff\u2019s Negligence Action\n             On March 6, 2012, several days prior to the expiration of the two-year\nlimitations period in 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a75524(2), Plaintiff initiated this case by writ of\nsummons.\n\n\n             Plaintiff filed a complaint in June 2012 and an amended complaint in\nJuly 2012. Plaintiff initially named Suspect, Donald Downes, owner of the car\ndriven by Suspect, Rasheena Bradley, whose vehicle Plaintiff\u2019s vehicle struck\nduring the collision, Ridley Township (Township), and two City of Chester police\nofficers. In October 2012, the trial court sustained preliminary objections filed by\nthe Chester police officers and removed their names from the caption.\n\n\n                         C. Second Amended Complaint\n             Thereafter, the trial court granted Plaintiff leave to file a second\namended complaint naming Borough Defendants. In July 2013, Plaintiff filed his\nsecond amended complaint. He served it on Borough Defendants in late August\n2013, more than three years and five months after the police pursuit and accident.\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f             In Count I, Plaintiff averred Defendants Ridley Township and Ridley\nPark Borough violated 75 Pa. C.S. \u00a76342 (written pursuit policies required) by\nfailing to create and implement a written training policy with respect to when a\npolice officer should initiate, continue, and terminate, a motor vehicle pursuit. As\na result, the Township and Borough created a danger that deprived Plaintiff of his\nsubstantive due process rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 and the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In Count II, Plaintiff averred Township and Borough Police Officers,\nunder color of state law, acted recklessly during the pursuit in violation of\nPlaintiff\u2019s substantive due process rights, 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 and the Fourteenth\nAmendment. In Count III, Plaintiff set forth a negligence claim against non-\ngovernmental Defendants Downes, Suspect and Bradley. In Count IV, Plaintiff\nagain averred Defendants Township and Borough failed to create and implement a\ntraining policy with respect to when a police officer should initiate, continue, and\nterminate, a motor vehicle pursuit. As a result, the Township and Borough created\na danger that deprived Plaintiff of his substantive due process rights in violation of\n42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 and the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n\n           D. Borough Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment\n                       1. Two-Year Statute of Limitations\n             In July 2014, following the close of the pleadings and discovery,\nBorough Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. Defendants asserted\nthe two-year statute of limitations for negligence actions in 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a75524(2)\nbarred Plaintiff\u2019s claims based on the March 2010 crash. To that end, Defendants\nmaintained, the statute of limitations for a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 is the\nforum state\u2019s statute of limitations for personal injury. Sameric Corp. v. City of\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fPhila., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754048\"><a href=\"/opinion/754048/sameric-corporation-of-delaware-inc-v-city-of-philadelphia-philadelphia/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">582</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1998). Thus, Borough Defendants argued Plaintiff\u2019s\nSection 1983 claims in Counts I, II and IV of Plaintiff\u2019s second amended\ncomplaint were time-barred.\n\n\n                                 2. Discovery Rule\n             Borough Defendants further averred the discovery rule, an exception\nto the traditional running of the statute of limitations, was inapplicable here. The\npurpose of the discovery rule is to exclude from the running of the statute of\nlimitations the period of time during which a plaintiff, who did not suffer an\nimmediately ascertainable injury, is reasonably unaware of his injury and what\ncaused it. Fine v. Checcio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2156626\"><a href=\"/opinion/2156626/fine-v-checcio/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 2005).\n\n\n             When a court is presented with the assertion that the discovery rule\napplies, it must address the ability of the injured party, exercising reasonable\ndiligence, to ascertain that he was injured and by what cause. Id. Because this\nquestion involves a factual determination as to whether a party was able, in the\nexercise of reasonable diligence, to know of his injury and its cause, it is ordinarily\na matter for the jury to decide. Id. However, where reasonable minds would not\ndiffer in finding that a party knew or should have known of his injury and its cause,\nthe court may, on its own, determine the discovery rule did not apply as a matter of\nlaw. Id.\n\n\n                               3. Fraudulent Concealment\n             In addition to the discovery rule, the Supreme Court in Fine noted that\nthe doctrine of fraudulent concealment may toll the statute of limitations. This\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fdoctrine is based on a theory of estoppel. It provides that a defendant may not\ninvoke the statute of limitations, if through fraud or concealment the defendant\ncauses the plaintiff to relax his vigilance or deviate from his right of inquiry into\nthe facts. Notably, however, Plaintiff never asserted the doctrine of fraudulent\nconcealment applied here.\n\n\n              4. Exceptions to Statute of Limitations Inapplicable\n             In their motion for summary judgment in the present case, Borough\nDefendants asserted the evidence produced during discovery indicated that\nPlaintiff became aware of his injuries on the day they occurred, and Plaintiff failed\nto use reasonable diligence in pursuing his claims and identifying the defendants.\nBorough Defendants also asserted they did not engage in any acts of concealment.\nConsequently, Borough Defendants argued that neither the discovery rule nor the\ndoctrine of fraudulent concealment applied in this case.\n\n                            5. Governmental Immunity\n             In addition, Borough Defendants asserted entitlement to immunity\nunder the statutory provisions commonly known as the Political Subdivision Tort\nClaims Act (Tort Claims Act). See 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a78541-42. They claimed Borough\nOfficer complied with Pennsylvania law and Borough police policy regarding\nvehicle pursuits by operating a mechanically sound vehicle with its lights and\nsirens activated.   Further, Borough Officer backed off pursuit of the fleeing\nvehicle, to the point it was no longer in sight, prior to the time of the accident.\nTherefore, Defendants argued they violated no duty to Plaintiff. See 75 Pa. C.S.\n\u00a73105 (drivers of emergency vehicles, including those in pursuit of suspected\nviolators of the law, may exercise special privileges including: proceeding through\n\n\n                                         7\n\fred traffic signals, after first slowing down as may be necessary; exceeding the\nmaximum speed limits so long as the driver does not endanger life or property;\nand, disregarding regulations governing direction or movement, overtaking\nvehicles or turning in specified directions).\n\n\n                          E. Plaintiff\u2019s Response to Motion\n               In opposition to Borough Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment,\nPlaintiff argued the discovery rule should apply. To that end, Plaintiff asserted, 10\ndays after the crash his former counsel hired a private investigator, Stephen J.\nKoerper (Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator). After visiting the accident scene, Investigator\nattempted to obtain information from the Ridley Township Police Department.\nHowever, the Township Police advised Investigator that the matter remained under\ncriminal investigation.     Thus, the Township Police only provided Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator with a report number. Further, Chester City Police Department\u2019s\ncrash report did not indicate Borough Defendants\u2019 involvement in the incident. In\nshort, nothing notified Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator of Borough Officer\u2019s involvement in\nthe pursuit.\n\n\n               After reviewing a newspaper article about the incident, Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator spoke with a witness, Louis Salerno (Witness Salerno), who recalled\nseeing a dark-colored car chased by a red Township police car (Dodge Charger).\nA Township K-9 unit (Ford Explorer) and an unmarked white car (Dodge Charger)\nfollowed behind.      Witness Salerno told Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator that all three\nvehicles were using emergency lights. Nevertheless, Salerno did not hear any\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fsirens. In addition, he did not recall seeing any Borough police vehicles (black and\nwhite patrol cars).\n\n\n              Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator also attempted to speak with Officer Harris of\nthe City of Chester City Police Department, who was unavailable and never\nresponded to Investigator\u2019s voice mail messages.                 Unable to obtain further\nresponses from the Township or City of Chester, Plaintiff\u2019s Investigator concluded\nhis investigation.\n\n\n              In July 2012, Plaintiff received an informal email from the Township\nindicating Borough Defendants\u2019 involvement in the incident. In April 2013, the\nparties held a status conference and discussed the parties\u2019 roles in the incident. In\nJuly 2013, Plaintiff received confirmation of Borough Defendants\u2019 involvement in\nthe pursuit. Plaintiff asserted the statute of limitations should run from this point.\nA week later, on July 18, 2013, Plaintiff filed his second amended complaint\nnaming the Borough and Borough Officer as defendants.\n\n\n                      F. Grant of Motion for Summary Judgment\n              In January 2015, the trial court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for\nsummary judgment and dismissed, with prejudice, Plaintiff\u2019s second amended\ncomplaint only as to Borough Defendants.3 In an opinion in support of its order,\n\n       3\n         The trial court, in its opinion in support of its order, noted that in November 2014, a\nprevious judge in the case, the Honorable G. Michael Green, granted motions for summary\njudgment on behalf of Defendant Donald Downes, the owner of the car driven by Suspect, and\nRidley Township, thereby dismissing Plaintiff\u2019s claims against them. See Tr. Ct., Slip. Op.,\n3/18/15, at 3; Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 120a.\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fthe trial court determined Plaintiff\u2019s claims against Borough Defendants were\nbarred by the two-year statute of limitations.\n\n\n               In addition, the trial court determined the discovery rule is unavailing\nto Plaintiff in this case. The court noted Plaintiff merely contended that the lapse\nof time in identifying Borough Defendants resulted from an inability by Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator to obtain sufficient information during his brief one-month\ninvestigation. See Tr.

Therefore, the trial court determined Plaintiff waived all\nissues on appeal. See Tr. Ct., Slip Op., at 9-10, n.3.

Inapplicability of Discovery Rule\n               On appeal, Plaintiff contends the trial court, in finding the discovery\nrule inapplicable in this case, usurped the jury\u2019s role by making factual and\ncredibility determinations. See Fine (whether a party was able, in the exercise of\n\n\n       4\n         Our review of a trial court order granting summary judgment is limited to determining\nwhether the trial court erred as a matter of law or abused its discretion. Kuniskas v.\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2010565\"><a href=\"/opinion/2010565/kuniskas-v-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. Cmwlth. 2009). We must examine the record in a light most\nfavorable to the non-moving party, accepting as true all well-pled facts and reasonable inferences\nto be drawn from those facts. Id.\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\freasonable diligence, to know of his injury and its cause are ordinarily factual\nquestions for the jury). The point at which a complaining party should reasonably\nbe aware that he suffered an injury is generally an issue for the jury. Id. Plaintiff\nasserts he first learned of Borough Defendants\u2019 involvement in the incident in a\nJuly 2012 email from Ridley Township. Therefore, Plaintiff argues, he had two\nyears from that date to name Borough Defendants.\n\n\n             Plaintiff first contends the trial court erred in concluding he should\nhave known Borough Officer attended to his injuries at the accident scene.\nContrary to the trial court\u2019s findings, Plaintiff asserts the collision rendered him\nunconscious and thus unable to identify the jurisdiction of the police officers that\nattended to him.\n\n\n             More importantly, Plaintiff contends the trial court erred in making\nthe factual determination that he unreasonably relied on the results of Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator\u2019s report, including the City of Chester crash report.            Plaintiff\u2019s\nInvestigator obtained a crash report from the City of Chester indicating that only\nthe Chester and Township Police Departments were involved in the investigation\nof the incident.\n\n\n             In addition, Plaintiff advances a number of factual arguments in\nsupport of his assertion that the trial court erred in finding the timely availability of\na voluminous public record of information regarding the pursuit and accident.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f             In sum, although Borough Defendants\u2019 alleged various shortcomings\nin Plaintiff\u2019s and his Investigator\u2019s efforts, Plaintiff nevertheless argues a jury\nquestion exists as to whether his reliance on Investigator\u2019s efforts constituted\nreasonable diligence warranting application of the discovery rule. Fine.\n\n\n                            B. Rule 1925(b) Statement\n             Plaintiff also contends the trial court erred in finding he waived his\nappellate issues by failing to serve the court with his Rule 1925(b) Concise\nStatement of the Errors Complained of on Appeal. Plaintiff asserts the trial court\nstated it never received service and accused Plaintiff of failing to produce any\nevidence of an attempt to comply with the service requirement in Pa. R.A.P.\n1925(b)(3)(iii) despite quoting the language from Plaintiff\u2019s 1925(b) Statement.\nTherefore, Plaintiff argues: \u201cIt is unclear how the trial court could argue it never\nreceived Plaintiff\u2019s 1925(b) statement, when it quoted the exact language of the\nstatement, in its opinion.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 41.\n\n\n             Further, Plaintiff asserts, his counsel would not have included the trial\njudge in the certificate of service if he did not serve the trial judge with the\nstatement. See Appellant\u2019s Br., Ex. N (Plaintiff\u2019s Concise Rule 1925(b) Statement\nof Errors Complained of on Appeal, with certificate of service).\n\n\n                                   IV.
