Joyce Murphy Brooks, Charlotte, North Carolina, for Appellees.\n\fOPINION\n\nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge:\n\nAs a result of a general reduction in force implemented by Cham-\npion International Corporation at its Canton Mill facility in Canton,\nNorth Carolina, 17 employees, whose \"general utility\" crew positions\nhad been eliminated, filed a grievance alleging the impairment or\nabrogation of job bidding rights given them under their collective bar-\ngaining agreement. The arbitrator misinterpreted the grievance and\nissued an award under a separate and special plant-modernization\nagreement negotiated by Champion and the Union to compensate\nonly those employees whose positions were eliminated by the earlier\nshutdown of a specific paper-making machine at the plant.\n\nOn appeal from the district court's affirmance of the award, we\nconclude that although the grievants' claim remains arbitrable, any\nremedy must derive from the collective bargaining agreement and not\nfrom the special plant-modernization agreement. Accordingly, we\nvacate the award and remand to enable the grievants to commence a\nnew arbitration of their grievance if they so choose.\n\nI\n\nIn 1991, Champion International Corporation, a paper manufac-\nturer, undertook to modernize its Canton Mill facility. The modern-\nization project involved permanently shutting down\"No. 14\nMachine\" and opening up a new, smaller pulp mill. At the time of its\ndecision, Champion was party to a collective bargaining agreement\nwith the United Paperworkers International Union, AFL-CIO, and its\naffiliated Local 507 (hereafter collectively, the\"Union\"). Accord-\ningly, Champion negotiated with the Union a specific agreement to\naddress the procedures for compensating those hourly employees at\nthe Canton Mill whose positions would be eliminated as a direct\nresult of the modernization project. This agreement, executed on Sep-\ntember 19, 1991, was known as \"Policy 683.\"\n\nPolicy 683, which was to be in effect only until December 31,\n1993, authorized either severance pay or stabilization bonuses to\n\n                    2\n\fworkers whose jobs were directly affected by the modernization proj-\nect. The severance pay provisions entitled employees to receive a\nlump sum severance payment equal to three weeks' pay plus one\nweek's pay for each year of service and one additional week's pay for\neach year of service over 15 years. By receiving a severance payment,\nthe employee agreed to waive all \"recall and/or bumping rights\" under\nthe collective bargaining agreement. Policy 683 also provided for sta-\nbilization bonuses as an \"incentive to keep people in the old manufac-\nturing facility\" -- a way to maintain the productivity of the soon-to-\nbe retired No. 14 Machine by retaining the employees who operated\nit until the new mill was ready. Without the monetary inducement of\nthe stabilization bonus, employees would likely bid out for other jobs\nwithin the mill. In effect, the bonus compensated employees for\ndelaying exercise of their job bidding rights under the collective bar-\ngaining agreement. The stabilization bonuses ranged from $1,000 to\n$10,000, depending on how long the employee remained at work on\nNo. 14 Machine.\n\nSpecific procedures for making claims for payment under Policy\n683 and for reviewing denials of claims were set out in the Policy.\nPolicy 683 provided that all claims were to be made to an administra-\ntor and that appeals from denials of claims could be taken internally.\nIt also provided that if an employee were denied a claim \"in whole\nor in part,\" the employee could \"seek assistance from the United\nStates Department of Labor, or such employee [could] file suit in state\nor federal court.\" Policy 683 did not mention arbitration.\n\nA year after Policy 683 was executed, Champion undertook an\nindependent, across-the-board reduction in workforce in response to\nthe deteriorating overall financial condition of the Canton Mill facil-\nity. Again, Champion negotiated an agreement with the Union to\nimplement the reduction in force. This agreement provided for sever-\nance payments to employees who elected to be severed and a proce-\ndure for filling the vacancies created by those elections through the\n\"normal posting and [job] bidding process.\" The agreement did not,\nhowever, provide for any kind of stabilization bonus comparable to\nthose provided for in Policy 683.\n\nAs a result of the general reduction in force, the entire \"general\nutility\" workgroup was notified in February 1994 that their positions\n\n                    3\n\fwere to be eliminated in June 1994. The 17 employees in that group\nthen filed a grievance against Champion under the collective bargain-\ning agreement, claiming that because they did not learn soon enough\nof the elimination of their workgroup, they lost job bidding rights. In\ntheir grievance, they stated:\n\n          Company representatives admittedly knew that the Gen.\n          Util. crew would be eliminated in June '94. By not sharing\n          this info., and deliberately covering up the matter, crew\n          employees were not given the right to explore alternative\n          avenues of employment within the mill. (Job bidding).\n          Request displacement compensation equal to #14 for each\n          crew member $7,000. We request total of $119,000.00.\n\nAlthough these 17 employees alluded in their grievance to compensa-\ntion \"equal to #14 for each crew member $7,000\" (emphasis added),\nit is undisputed that these 17 employees were not terminated by the\nshutdown of Machine No. 14 and therefore were not identified in Pol-\nicy 683 as those who were entitled to compensation as a direct result\nof modernization.\n\nThese employees' grievance was denied at each step of Champi-\non's internal grievance procedure provided by the collective bargain-\ning agreement and then was submitted to final, binding arbitration in\nMay 1996. The arbitrator to whom the matter was assigned undertook\nto decide the following two issues:\n\n          [Is] the Grievants' claim for Stabilization Bonus payments\n          under Severance Plan No. 683 substantively arbitrable?\n\n          Whether the Company violated the Collective Bargaining\n          Agreement by withholding the Stabilization Bonus pay-\n          ments provided in Severance Plan No. 683 to the utility\n          crew employees in the Paper and Board department?\n\nIn rendering an award for the 17 employees, the arbitrator concluded\nthat \"the Grievants' claim for stabilization bonus payment is arbitra-\nble\" and that Champion \"violated the Agreement by withholding the\nStabilization Bonus payments provided in Severance Plan No. 683 to\nthe utility crew employees in the Paper and Board department.\"\n\n                    4\n\fSeeking review of the award in the courts, Champion filed this\naction under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), to bar enforcement of the award, and the Union filed\na cross-claim for enforcement. On cross motions for summary judg-\nment, the district court entered judgment in favor of the Union,\nenforcing the award of stabilization bonuses to the 17 employees.\n\nOn this appeal, Champion contends (1) that because there was no\nevidence of economic loss by the grievants, the $119,000 award was\npunitive, and punitive damages were not authorized by either the col-\nlective bargaining agreement or Policy 683; (2) that the 17 grievants\nwere not covered by Policy 683 and therefore not entitled to the stabi-\nlization bonuses provided for in the Policy; and (3) that disputes aris-\ning under Policy 683 are not arbitrable.\n\nII\n\nThe logical order for review of the district court's judgment affirm-\ning the arbitration award in this case suggests that we determine first,\nwhether the grievance filed by the 17 employees is a matter for arbi-\ntration, and second, whether the arbitration award itself draws its\nessence from the agreement providing for the arbitration. The control-\nling principles for addressing these questions are well established.\n\nBecause the requirement to submit to arbitration is solely a matter\nof contract, arbitrability is a matter of contract interpretation which is\n\"undeniably an issue for judicial determination.\" AT&T Technologies,\nInc. v.

Thus, a court must vacate an arbitrator's award if it vio-\nlates clearly established public policy, fails to draw its essence from\nthe collective bargaining agreement, or reflects merely the arbitrator's\npersonal notions of right and wrong. See Mountaineer Gas, 76 F.3d\nat 608.\n\nWhile an arbitrator is generally under no obligation to provide rea-\nsons for his decision, Enterprise Wheel, 363 U.S. at 598, a court\nreviewing an arbitration award must satisfy itself that the award is\ngrounded in the collective bargaining agreement rather than in the\narbitrator's \"own brand of industrial justice,\" id. at 597. One way to\ntest the validity of an arbitration award on this basis is to ask \"whether\nthe award ignored the plain language of the [collective bargaining\nagreement].\" Mountaineer Gas, 76 F.3d at 608.\n\nIII\n\nTurning now to the case before us, the 17 grievants complained\nthat Champion's delay in informing them that the\"general utility\"\n\n                     6\n\fcrew jobs would be eliminated by the across-the-board reduction in\nforce interfered with their ability to bid for other jobs. They requested\ncompensation for this alleged abridgement of rights guaranteed by the\ncollective bargaining agreement in an amount equal to the stabiliza-\ntion bonuses provided for under Policy 683, but they did not request\nthe actual bonuses. The arbitrator first misinterpreted this grievance\nto present the question of whether the grievants' claims for \"Stabiliza-\ntion Bonus payments under Severance Plan No. 683 [were] substan-\ntively arbitrable.\" (Emphasis added). The arbitrator concluded that\nPolicy 683 was a continuing negotiation with respect to the underly-\ning collective bargaining agreement and that upon its execution, Pol-\nicy 683 became a part of the collective bargaining agreement. In\naddition to concluding that Policy 683 was not an independent agree-\nment, the arbitrator also concluded that Policy 683 did not modify the\ncollective bargaining agreement's arbitration clause. Accordingly, the\narbitrator relied on the arbitration clause of the underlying collective\nbargaining agreement for jurisdiction to enter his award of stabiliza-\ntion bonuses under Policy 683.\n\nWhile it is true that the collective bargaining agreement provided\nthe arbitrator with jurisdiction to \"interpret, apply, or determine com-\npliance with the provisions of this [collective bargaining] Agree-\nment,\" it does not follow that disputes under Policy 683 must\ntherefore be resolved through arbitration. On the contrary, Policy 683\nprovided that initial claims for stabilization bonuses were to be made\nto Champion's plan administrator who was given, under Policy 683,\n\"the power and authority in its sole, absolute and uncontrolled discre-\ntion to control and manage the operation and administration of the\nPolicy.\" Any disagreement with the decision of the administrator\nwould have to be resolved by appeals, first to the vice president of\n\"Benefits\" and then to the vice president of\"Employee Staffing and\nDevelopment.\" Policy 683 then provided that a claimant could seek\nfurther relief from the Department of Labor or from state or federal\ncourts.\n\nThe confusion surrounding the arbitrability of this dispute stems\nfrom the arbitrator's misinterpretation of the grievance as arising\nunder Policy 683 rather than under the job bidding procedures of the\ncollective bargaining agreement and then his further misinterpretation\nthat disputes over Policy 683 benefits are arbitrable under the collec-\n\n                     7\n\ftive bargaining agreement without regard for the dispute resolution\nmechanisms provided by Policy 683. If he had correctly read the\ngrievants' claim as arising under the job-bidding provisions of the\ncollective bargaining agreement, the nature of Policy 683's benefits\nand their arbitrability would never have come under consideration.\nAlthough it is true that the grievants did request damages in an\namount \"equal to\" the stabilization bonuses awarded to employees\nwhose employment was terminated by the close of No. 14 Machine,\nit is also clear that they neither claimed those specific benefits nor\nexplicitly mentioned Policy 683. Their reference to\"#14\" was merely\nan attempt at valuing compensation for a waiver of job bidding rights\nby alluding to a measure agreed upon in another, nonapplicable agree-\nment.\n\nOn its face, the grievance rested on the collective bargaining agree-\nment without regard to Policy 683. A grievance claiming lost or com-\npromised job bidding rights could only be made under Article VIII(F)\nof the collective bargaining agreement and under Article XXX(B)\nwhich requires notice of \"change [in] methods of operation . . . which\nmay result in elimination of jobs.\" Although the grievants -- who\ncompleted the grievance form without the assistance of counsel -- did\nnot invoke these specific articles of the collective bargaining agree-\nment, they did use the term \"Job Bidding\" to specify the contractual\nrights they claim were abridged by Champion. In their own words, the\nemployees identified their claimed harm as a loss of the \"right to\nexplore alternative avenues of employment within the mill.\" In\nessence, the grievants claimed that in reliance on Champion's state-\nments that their jobs were not in jeopardy in the across-the-board\nworkforce reduction, \"general utility\" crew members refrained from\nusing their often considerable seniority to bid out to other jobs at the\nCanton Mill. Had they been advised otherwise, the grievants alleged,\nthey would have exercised their bidding rights under the collective\nbargaining agreement and would consequently have enjoyed greater\nseniority, wages, or promotion potential. They allege that by failing\nto disclose timely the necessity of eliminating the\"general utility\"\nclassification, Champion caused the grievants involuntarily to waive\ntheir job bidding rights.\n\nThis claim, whether meritorious or not, clearly arises under collec-\ntive bargaining agreement provisions unrelated to Policy 683, and\n\n                    8\n\ftherefore the 17 grievants' claim is a matter suitable for arbitration as\nprovided in the collective bargaining agreement. In reaching this con-\nclusion, we look not to the arbitrator's framing of the issue, but\ninstead to whether the factual situation that gave rise to the complaint,\nas well as the rights that were allegedly abridged, are within the scope\nof the collective bargaining agreement's arbitration clause as inter-\npreted by the court. See J. J. Ryan & Sons, Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc Tex-\ntile, S.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515742\"><a href=\"/opinion/515742/jj-ryan-sons-inc-v-rhone-poulenc-textile-sa-rhone-poulenc-fibers/\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319 (4th Cir. 1988) (noting that the\narbitrability determination centers on \"whether the factual allegations\nunderlying the claim are within the scope of the arbitration clause,\nregardless of the legal label assigned to the claim\").\n\nIV\n\nHaving thus concluded that the grievance in this case was arbitra-\nble, we must still determine whether the arbitrator's award drew its\nessence from the collective bargaining agreement. See Misco, 484\nU.S. at 36 (noting that an arbitrator's award must\"draw[ ] its essence\nfrom the collective bargaining agreement\" and not from \"his own\nbrand of industrial justice\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). On\nthis issue, the arbitrator continued to misconstrue the grievants' claim\nas actually demanding stabilization bonuses under Policy 683, and\nthrough that misconstruction, the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his\nauthority when he actually awarded those stabilization bonuses to the\n17 grievants. Regardless of whether the arbitrator relied on the collec-\ntive bargaining agreement or on Policy 683, his award failed to draw\nits essence from either agreement.\n\nThe arbitrator recognized that Policy 683 was executed between\nChampion and the Union to provide severance payments and stabili-\nzation bonuses to specific employees whose employment was termi-\nnated as a result of the shutdown of No. 14 Machine. Policy 683\nprovides explicitly that its benefits apply only to employees \"whose\nemployment is or will be terminated as a result of the Modernization\nProject\" and can be granted only through December 31, 1993. Thus,\nthe arbitrator correctly concluded that \"[t]he only place the Stabiliza-\ntion Bonus is provided for is in [Policy No. 683], [and] [t]o qualify\nfor the bonus, it must be shown that these employees were covered\nby [Policy 683].\" The arbitrator also recognized that the 17 grievants\nbefore him were not terminated by the shutdown of No. 14 Machine\n\n                     9\n\fbut were reclassified as a result of the across-the-board reduction in\nforce. He found this as a fact, stating that the restructuring was\nundertaken \"solely for economic purposes unrelated to the moderniza-\ntion project [represented by the close of No. 14 Machine].\" But in\norder to circumvent the obvious conclusion that the grievants there-\nfore were not eligible for stabilization bonuses under Policy 683, the\narbitrator bypassed the language of Policy 683 and generally linked\nthe reasons for Policy 683 to the reason for the general reduction in\nforce. The arbitrator stated:\n\n          [Policy No. 683] directly caused the closing of the No. 14\n          Pulp machine. This closing resulted in the actions taken\n          against these employees. Thus, indirectly, these employees\n          were affected by the closing of the No. 14 Pulp machine.\n          The entire process is intricately intertwined. It is difficult to\n          claim and justify not covering these employees under the\n          stabilization bonus plan of [Policy 683].\n\nThrough this reasoning, the arbitrator concluded that employee bene-\nfits awardable under Policy 683 should be given to any employee\nwhose job was eliminated, regardless of the employee's eligibility\nunder the Policy. And in doing so, he went beyond the authorizing\nboundaries of that agreement and awarded stabilization bonuses to\nnon-qualifying employees whose jobs were eliminated as a result of\ngeneral economic conditions after the time for payment of the\nbonuses had expired. The arbitrator had no contractual authority from\nPolicy 683 to make his award, and thus the award could not be justi-\nfied by that Policy.\n\nBecause the award of stabilization bonuses to these grievants does\nnot draw its essence from Policy 683, the award is only legitimate if\nit is derived from the terms of the underlying collective bargaining\nagreement. But this agreement makes no provision for stabilization\nbonuses of any kind. It is therefore not surprising that nowhere in his\nconfusing and internally inconsistent ruling does the arbitrator men-\ntion any provisions of the collective bargaining agreement to support\nthe award. In a section entitled \"Relevant Contract Provisions\" earlier\nin his written opinion, the arbitrator cites, without comment, Article\nXXX(B), the collective bargaining agreement's provision requiring\ncommunication between Champion and the Union on projected job\n\n                     10\n\feliminations, but he never refers to it in the merits section of the\naward.

See Mountaineer Gas, 76 F.3d at 608 (noting that an arbitration\naward that \"ignore[s] the plain language\" of the collective bargaining\nagreement cannot stand). These procedures delineate the rights the\ngrievants may have under the collective bargaining agreement. Fail-\nure to construe these contractual provisions is evidence of a basic\nabdication of an arbitrator's duty to apply the contract that governs\nthe grievance. See Clinchfield Coal, 720 F.2d at 1369 (\"Where, as\nhere, the arbitrator fails to discuss critical contract terminology, which\nterminology might reasonably require an opposite result, the award\ncannot be considered to draw its essence from the contract\").\n\nBecause the arbitrator failed to apply the underlying collective bar-\ngaining agreement and instead attempted to apply the terms of Policy\n683 which, as he explicitly recognized, did not apply, the only infer-\nence we can draw is that his award was based on something other the\ncollective bargaining agreement or Policy 683. It appears most likely\nthat he drew on his own notions of fairness as revealed by his state-\nment, \"It is difficult to claim and justify not covering these employees\nunder the stabilization bonus plan [of Policy 683].\" Difficult or not to\njustify, these employees' grievance did not arise under Policy 683,\nand the arbitrator's personal notions of fairness cannot be the basis for\nawarding compensation to them under Policy 683. Because the arbi-\ntrator's award of stabilization bonuses failed to draw its essence from\nany applicable agreement, it is illegal and must be vacated.\n\nV\n\nThis conclusion, however, does not end the matter.

Joyce Murphy Brooks, Charlotte, North Carolina, for Appellees.\n\fOPINION\n\nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge:\n\nAs a result of a general reduction in force implemented by Cham-\npion International Corporation at its Canton Mill facility in Canton,\nNorth Carolina, 17 employees, whose \"general utility\" crew positions\nhad been eliminated, filed a grievance alleging the impairment or\nabrogation of job bidding rights given them under their collective bar-\ngaining agreement. The arbitrator misinterpreted the grievance and\nissued an award under a separate and special plant-modernization\nagreement negotiated by Champion and the Union to compensate\nonly those employees whose positions were eliminated by the earlier\nshutdown of a specific paper-making machine at the plant.\n\nOn appeal from the district court's affirmance of the award, we\nconclude that although the grievants' claim remains arbitrable, any\nremedy must derive from the collective bargaining agreement and not\nfrom the special plant-modernization agreement. Accordingly, we\nvacate the award and remand to enable the grievants to commence a\nnew arbitration of their grievance if they so choose.\n\nI\n\nIn 1991, Champion International Corporation, a paper manufac-\nturer, undertook to modernize its Canton Mill facility. The modern-\nization project involved permanently shutting down\"No. 14\nMachine\" and opening up a new, smaller pulp mill. At the time of its\ndecision, Champion was party to a collective bargaining agreement\nwith the United Paperworkers International Union, AFL-CIO, and its\naffiliated Local 507 (hereafter collectively, the\"Union\"). Accord-\ningly, Champion negotiated with the Union a specific agreement to\naddress the procedures for compensating those hourly employees at\nthe Canton Mill whose positions would be eliminated as a direct\nresult of the modernization project. This agreement, executed on Sep-\ntember 19, 1991, was known as \"Policy 683.\"\n\nPolicy 683, which was to be in effect only until December 31,\n1993, authorized either severance pay or stabilization bonuses to\n\n                    2\n\fworkers whose jobs were directly affected by the modernization proj-\nect. The severance pay provisions entitled employees to receive a\nlump sum severance payment equal to three weeks' pay plus one\nweek's pay for each year of service and one additional week's pay for\neach year of service over 15 years. By receiving a severance payment,\nthe employee agreed to waive all \"recall and/or bumping rights\" under\nthe collective bargaining agreement. Policy 683 also provided for sta-\nbilization bonuses as an \"incentive to keep people in the old manufac-\nturing facility\" -- a way to maintain the productivity of the soon-to-\nbe retired No. 14 Machine by retaining the employees who operated\nit until the new mill was ready. Without the monetary inducement of\nthe stabilization bonus, employees would likely bid out for other jobs\nwithin the mill. In effect, the bonus compensated employees for\ndelaying exercise of their job bidding rights under the collective bar-\ngaining agreement. The stabilization bonuses ranged from $1,000 to\n$10,000, depending on how long the employee remained at work on\nNo. 14 Machine.\n\nSpecific procedures for making claims for payment under Policy\n683 and for reviewing denials of claims were set out in the Policy.\nPolicy 683 provided that all claims were to be made to an administra-\ntor and that appeals from denials of claims could be taken internally.\nIt also provided that if an employee were denied a claim \"in whole\nor in part,\" the employee could \"seek assistance from the United\nStates Department of Labor, or such employee [could] file suit in state\nor federal court.\" Policy 683 did not mention arbitration.\n\nA year after Policy 683 was executed, Champion undertook an\nindependent, across-the-board reduction in workforce in response to\nthe deteriorating overall financial condition of the Canton Mill facil-\nity. Again, Champion negotiated an agreement with the Union to\nimplement the reduction in force. This agreement provided for sever-\nance payments to employees who elected to be severed and a proce-\ndure for filling the vacancies created by those elections through the\n\"normal posting and [job] bidding process.\" The agreement did not,\nhowever, provide for any kind of stabilization bonus comparable to\nthose provided for in Policy 683.\n\nAs a result of the general reduction in force, the entire \"general\nutility\" workgroup was notified in February 1994 that their positions\n\n                    3\n\fwere to be eliminated in June 1994. The 17 employees in that group\nthen filed a grievance against Champion under the collective bargain-\ning agreement, claiming that because they did not learn soon enough\nof the elimination of their workgroup, they lost job bidding rights. In\ntheir grievance, they stated:\n\n          Company representatives admittedly knew that the Gen.\n          Util. crew would be eliminated in June '94. By not sharing\n          this info., and deliberately covering up the matter, crew\n          employees were not given the right to explore alternative\n          avenues of employment within the mill. (Job bidding).\n          Request displacement compensation equal to #14 for each\n          crew member $7,000. We request total of $119,000.00.\n\nAlthough these 17 employees alluded in their grievance to compensa-\ntion \"equal to #14 for each crew member $7,000\" (emphasis added),\nit is undisputed that these 17 employees were not terminated by the\nshutdown of Machine No. 14 and therefore were not identified in Pol-\nicy 683 as those who were entitled to compensation as a direct result\nof modernization.\n\nThese employees' grievance was denied at each step of Champi-\non's internal grievance procedure provided by the collective bargain-\ning agreement and then was submitted to final, binding arbitration in\nMay 1996. The arbitrator to whom the matter was assigned undertook\nto decide the following two issues:\n\n          [Is] the Grievants' claim for Stabilization Bonus payments\n          under Severance Plan No. 683 substantively arbitrable?\n\n          Whether the Company violated the Collective Bargaining\n          Agreement by withholding the Stabilization Bonus pay-\n          ments provided in Severance Plan No. 683 to the utility\n          crew employees in the Paper and Board department?\n\nIn rendering an award for the 17 employees, the arbitrator concluded\nthat \"the Grievants' claim for stabilization bonus payment is arbitra-\nble\" and that Champion \"violated the Agreement by withholding the\nStabilization Bonus payments provided in Severance Plan No. 683 to\nthe utility crew employees in the Paper and Board department.\"\n\n                    4\n\fSeeking review of the award in the courts, Champion filed this\naction under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), to bar enforcement of the award, and the Union filed\na cross-claim for enforcement. On cross motions for summary judg-\nment, the district court entered judgment in favor of the Union,\nenforcing the award of stabilization bonuses to the 17 employees.\n\nOn this appeal, Champion contends (1) that because there was no\nevidence of economic loss by the grievants, the $119,000 award was\npunitive, and punitive damages were not authorized by either the col-\nlective bargaining agreement or Policy 683; (2) that the 17 grievants\nwere not covered by Policy 683 and therefore not entitled to the stabi-\nlization bonuses provided for in the Policy; and (3) that disputes aris-\ning under Policy 683 are not arbitrable.\n\nII\n\nThe logical order for review of the district court's judgment affirm-\ning the arbitration award in this case suggests that we determine first,\nwhether the grievance filed by the 17 employees is a matter for arbi-\ntration, and second, whether the arbitration award itself draws its\nessence from the agreement providing for the arbitration. The control-\nling principles for addressing these questions are well established.\n\nBecause the requirement to submit to arbitration is solely a matter\nof contract, arbitrability is a matter of contract interpretation which is\n\"undeniably an issue for judicial determination.\" AT&T Technologies,\nInc. v. Communications Workers, 475 U.S. 643, 648-49 (1986).\nTherefore, \"[u]nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide oth-\nerwise, the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be\ndecided by the court, not the arbitrator.\" Id. at 649; see also Brown\nv. Trans World Airlines, 127 F.3d 337, 340 (4th Cir. 1997) (\"The\ndetermination of the arbitration provision's scope and meaning is for\nthe court to resolve\"); Local 637, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers v. Davis\nH. Elliot Co., 13 F.3d 129, 132 (4th Cir. 1993) (\"Were arbitrators\ngiven the authority to decide their own jurisdiction, arbitration clauses\nwould be far less popular\").\n\nBut for matters within the scope of an arbitration clause, the arbi-\ntrator's award is final and binding. A court does not \"sit to hear\n\n                     5\n\fclaims of factual or legal error by an arbitrator,\" and must defer to the\narbitrator \"as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or\napplying the contract.\" United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco,\nInc., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987); see also Mountaineer Gas Co. v. Oil,\nChemical & Atomic Workers Int'l Union, 76 F.3d 606, 608 (4th Cir.\n1996) (describing the court's role as determining\"only whether the\narbitrator did his job -- not whether he did it well, correctly, or rea-\nsonably, but simply whether he did it\" (citing Remmey v. PaineWeb-\nber, Inc., 32 F.3d 143, 146 (4th Cir. 1994))).\n\nThe court nevertheless retains the obligation to insure that the arbi-\ntrator has acted within the contractually-drawn boundaries of his\nauthority. This is important because\n\n          an arbitrator . . . does not sit to dispense his own brand of\n          industrial justice. . . . [H]is award is legitimate only so long\n          as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agree-\n          ment. When the arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to\n          this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforce-\n          ment of the award.\n\nUnited Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593,\n597 (1960). Thus, a court must vacate an arbitrator's award if it vio-\nlates clearly established public policy, fails to draw its essence from\nthe collective bargaining agreement, or reflects merely the arbitrator's\npersonal notions of right and wrong. See Mountaineer Gas, 76 F.3d\nat 608.\n\nWhile an arbitrator is generally under no obligation to provide rea-\nsons for his decision, Enterprise Wheel, 363 U.S. at 598, a court\nreviewing an arbitration award must satisfy itself that the award is\ngrounded in the collective bargaining agreement rather than in the\narbitrator's \"own brand of industrial justice,\" id. at 597. One way to\ntest the validity of an arbitration award on this basis is to ask \"whether\nthe award ignored the plain language of the [collective bargaining\nagreement].\" Mountaineer Gas, 76 F.3d at 608.\n\nIII\n\nTurning now to the case before us, the 17 grievants complained\nthat Champion's delay in informing them that the\"general utility\"\n\n                     6\n\fcrew jobs would be eliminated by the across-the-board reduction in\nforce interfered with their ability to bid for other jobs. They requested\ncompensation for this alleged abridgement of rights guaranteed by the\ncollective bargaining agreement in an amount equal to the stabiliza-\ntion bonuses provided for under Policy 683, but they did not request\nthe actual bonuses. The arbitrator first misinterpreted this grievance\nto present the question of whether the grievants' claims for \"Stabiliza-\ntion Bonus payments under Severance Plan No. 683 [were] substan-\ntively arbitrable.\" (Emphasis added). The arbitrator concluded that\nPolicy 683 was a continuing negotiation with respect to the underly-\ning collective bargaining agreement and that upon its execution, Pol-\nicy 683 became a part of the collective bargaining agreement. In\naddition to concluding that Policy 683 was not an independent agree-\nment, the arbitrator also concluded that Policy 683 did not modify the\ncollective bargaining agreement's arbitration clause. Accordingly, the\narbitrator relied on the arbitration clause of the underlying collective\nbargaining agreement for jurisdiction to enter his award of stabiliza-\ntion bonuses under Policy 683.\n\nWhile it is true that the collective bargaining agreement provided\nthe arbitrator with jurisdiction to \"interpret, apply, or determine com-\npliance with the provisions of this [collective bargaining] Agree-\nment,\" it does not follow that disputes under Policy 683 must\ntherefore be resolved through arbitration. On the contrary, Policy 683\nprovided that initial claims for stabilization bonuses were to be made\nto Champion's plan administrator who was given, under Policy 683,\n\"the power and authority in its sole, absolute and uncontrolled discre-\ntion to control and manage the operation and administration of the\nPolicy.\" Any disagreement with the decision of the administrator\nwould have to be resolved by appeals, first to the vice president of\n\"Benefits\" and then to the vice president of\"Employee Staffing and\nDevelopment.\" Policy 683 then provided that a claimant could seek\nfurther relief from the Department of Labor or from state or federal\ncourts.\n\nThe confusion surrounding the arbitrability of this dispute stems\nfrom the arbitrator's misinterpretation of the grievance as arising\nunder Policy 683 rather than under the job bidding procedures of the\ncollective bargaining agreement and then his further misinterpretation\nthat disputes over Policy 683 benefits are arbitrable under the collec-\n\n                     7\n\ftive bargaining agreement without regard for the dispute resolution\nmechanisms provided by Policy 683. If he had correctly read the\ngrievants' claim as arising under the job-bidding provisions of the\ncollective bargaining agreement, the nature of Policy 683's benefits\nand their arbitrability would never have come under consideration.\nAlthough it is true that the grievants did request damages in an\namount \"equal to\" the stabilization bonuses awarded to employees\nwhose employment was terminated by the close of No. 14 Machine,\nit is also clear that they neither claimed those specific benefits nor\nexplicitly mentioned Policy 683. Their reference to\"#14\" was merely\nan attempt at valuing compensation for a waiver of job bidding rights\nby alluding to a measure agreed upon in another, nonapplicable agree-\nment.\n\nOn its face, the grievance rested on the collective bargaining agree-\nment without regard to Policy 683. A grievance claiming lost or com-\npromised job bidding rights could only be made under Article VIII(F)\nof the collective bargaining agreement and under Article XXX(B)\nwhich requires notice of \"change [in] methods of operation . . . which\nmay result in elimination of jobs.\" Although the grievants -- who\ncompleted the grievance form without the assistance of counsel -- did\nnot invoke these specific articles of the collective bargaining agree-\nment, they did use the term \"Job Bidding\" to specify the contractual\nrights they claim were abridged by Champion. In their own words, the\nemployees identified their claimed harm as a loss of the \"right to\nexplore alternative avenues of employment within the mill.\" In\nessence, the grievants claimed that in reliance on Champion's state-\nments that their jobs were not in jeopardy in the across-the-board\nworkforce reduction, \"general utility\" crew members refrained from\nusing their often considerable seniority to bid out to other jobs at the\nCanton Mill. Had they been advised otherwise, the grievants alleged,\nthey would have exercised their bidding rights under the collective\nbargaining agreement and would consequently have enjoyed greater\nseniority, wages, or promotion potential. They allege that by failing\nto disclose timely the necessity of eliminating the\"general utility\"\nclassification, Champion caused the grievants involuntarily to waive\ntheir job bidding rights.\n\nThis claim, whether meritorious or not, clearly arises under collec-\ntive bargaining agreement provisions unrelated to Policy 683, and\n\n                    8\n\ftherefore the 17 grievants' claim is a matter suitable for arbitration as\nprovided in the collective bargaining agreement. In reaching this con-\nclusion, we look not to the arbitrator's framing of the issue, but\ninstead to whether the factual situation that gave rise to the complaint,\nas well as the rights that were allegedly abridged, are within the scope\nof the collective bargaining agreement's arbitration clause as inter-\npreted by the court. See J. J. Ryan & Sons, Inc. v. Rhone Poulenc Tex-\ntile, S.A., 863 F.2d 315, 319 (4th Cir. 1988) (noting that the\narbitrability determination centers on \"whether the factual allegations\nunderlying the claim are within the scope of the arbitration clause,\nregardless of the legal label assigned to the claim\").\n\nIV\n\nHaving thus concluded that the grievance in this case was arbitra-\nble, we must still determine whether the arbitrator's award drew its\nessence from the collective bargaining agreement. See Misco, 484\nU.S. at 36 (noting that an arbitrator's award must\"draw[ ] its essence\nfrom the collective bargaining agreement\" and not from \"his own\nbrand of industrial justice\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). On\nthis issue, the arbitrator continued to misconstrue the grievants' claim\nas actually demanding stabilization bonuses under Policy 683, and\nthrough that misconstruction, the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his\nauthority when he actually awarded those stabilization bonuses to the\n17 grievants. Regardless of whether the arbitrator relied on the collec-\ntive bargaining agreement or on Policy 683, his award failed to draw\nits essence from either agreement.\n\nThe arbitrator recognized that Policy 683 was executed between\nChampion and the Union to provide severance payments and stabili-\nzation bonuses to specific employees whose employment was termi-\nnated as a result of the shutdown of No. 14 Machine. Policy 683\nprovides explicitly that its benefits apply only to employees \"whose\nemployment is or will be terminated as a result of the Modernization\nProject\" and can be granted only through December 31, 1993. Thus,\nthe arbitrator correctly concluded that \"[t]he only place the Stabiliza-\ntion Bonus is provided for is in [Policy No. 683], [and] [t]o qualify\nfor the bonus, it must be shown that these employees were covered\nby [Policy 683].\" The arbitrator also recognized that the 17 grievants\nbefore him were not terminated by the shutdown of No. 14 Machine\n\n                     9\n\fbut were reclassified as a result of the across-the-board reduction in\nforce. He found this as a fact, stating that the restructuring was\nundertaken \"solely for economic purposes unrelated to the moderniza-\ntion project [represented by the close of No. 14 Machine].\" But in\norder to circumvent the obvious conclusion that the grievants there-\nfore were not eligible for stabilization bonuses under Policy 683, the\narbitrator bypassed the language of Policy 683 and generally linked\nthe reasons for Policy 683 to the reason for the general reduction in\nforce. The arbitrator stated:\n\n          [Policy No. 683] directly caused the closing of the No. 14\n          Pulp machine. This closing resulted in the actions taken\n          against these employees. Thus, indirectly, these employees\n          were affected by the closing of the No. 14 Pulp machine.\n          The entire process is intricately intertwined. It is difficult to\n          claim and justify not covering these employees under the\n          stabilization bonus plan of [Policy 683].\n\nThrough this reasoning, the arbitrator concluded that employee bene-\nfits awardable under Policy 683 should be given to any employee\nwhose job was eliminated, regardless of the employee's eligibility\nunder the Policy. And in doing so, he went beyond the authorizing\nboundaries of that agreement and awarded stabilization bonuses to\nnon-qualifying employees whose jobs were eliminated as a result of\ngeneral economic conditions after the time for payment of the\nbonuses had expired. The arbitrator had no contractual authority from\nPolicy 683 to make his award, and thus the award could not be justi-\nfied by that Policy.\n\nBecause the award of stabilization bonuses to these grievants does\nnot draw its essence from Policy 683, the award is only legitimate if\nit is derived from the terms of the underlying collective bargaining\nagreement. But this agreement makes no provision for stabilization\nbonuses of any kind. It is therefore not surprising that nowhere in his\nconfusing and internally inconsistent ruling does the arbitrator men-\ntion any provisions of the collective bargaining agreement to support\nthe award. In a section entitled \"Relevant Contract Provisions\" earlier\nin his written opinion, the arbitrator cites, without comment, Article\nXXX(B), the collective bargaining agreement's provision requiring\ncommunication between Champion and the Union on projected job\n\n                     10\n\feliminations, but he never refers to it in the merits section of the\naward. See Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Dist. 28, United Mine Workers,\n720 F.2d 1365, 1369 (4th Cir. 1983) (noting that\"stating an issue\nwithout discussing it\" does not provide an adequate contractual basis\nfor an arbitration award).\n\nEqually problematic is the arbitrator's failure to mention and to\naddress Article VIII(F), the job bidding procedures actually invoked\nby the grievants and spelled out in the collective bargaining agree-\nment. See Mountaineer Gas, 76 F.3d at 608 (noting that an arbitration\naward that \"ignore[s] the plain language\" of the collective bargaining\nagreement cannot stand). These procedures delineate the rights the\ngrievants may have under the collective bargaining agreement. Fail-\nure to construe these contractual provisions is evidence of a basic\nabdication of an arbitrator's duty to apply the contract that governs\nthe grievance. See Clinchfield Coal, 720 F.2d at 1369 (\"Where, as\nhere, the arbitrator fails to discuss critical contract terminology, which\nterminology might reasonably require an opposite result, the award\ncannot be considered to draw its essence from the contract\").\n\nBecause the arbitrator failed to apply the underlying collective bar-\ngaining agreement and instead attempted to apply the terms of Policy\n683 which, as he explicitly recognized, did not apply, the only infer-\nence we can draw is that his award was based on something other the\ncollective bargaining agreement or Policy 683. It appears most likely\nthat he drew on his own notions of fairness as revealed by his state-\nment, \"It is difficult to claim and justify not covering these employees\nunder the stabilization bonus plan [of Policy 683].\" Difficult or not to\njustify, these employees' grievance did not arise under Policy 683,\nand the arbitrator's personal notions of fairness cannot be the basis for\nawarding compensation to them under Policy 683. Because the arbi-\ntrator's award of stabilization bonuses failed to draw its essence from\nany applicable agreement, it is illegal and must be vacated.\n\nV\n\nThis conclusion, however, does not end the matter. The 17 griev-\nants filed an arbitrable claim for impairment of job bidding rights,\nwhich has not yet been arbitrated under the collective bargaining\nagreement.
