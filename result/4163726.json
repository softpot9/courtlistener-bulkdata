At the beginning of the trial,\n\nthe State provided to Ledford\u2019s counsel a video of her arrest from which the portions\n\nrelating to the HGN test had been redacted.\n\n      During direct examination at trial of the police officer who arrested Ledford,\n\nthe State asked, \u201cWhat have you been trained, as far as how many clues [on the walk-\n\nand-turn evaluation] indicate impairment?\u201d When the officer attempted to link a\n\nnumber of clues to \u201cBAC level,\u201d defense counsel objected. After the State attempted\n\nto lay a foundation for testimony about the correlation between clues on a field\n\nsobriety test and blood-alcohol content outside the presence of the jury, the trial court\n\nsustained the defendant\u2019s objection to testimony \u201cas to percentages\u201d of blood alcohol.\n\nBefore the jury returned to the courtroom, defense counsel stated:\n\n      Your Honor, before we bring the jury back in - - it was actually - - I was\n      watching [the solicitor] trying to make sure that we are all aware,\n      including [the o]fficer [], that the evidence of the horizontal gaze\n\n                                           2\n\f      nystagmus test was suppressed so that we don\u2019t end up making a\n      mistake of that. We\u2019re not going to talk about HGN, at all, and that way\n      we don\u2019t end up having a mistrial. My client can\u2019t afford to try this case\n      twice.\n\n\nThe trial court agreed, and the jury returned to the courtroom.\n\n      The State resumed direct examination of the police officer and she testified\n\nabout the clues from various field sobriety tests indicating Ledford\u2019s impairment,\n\nLedford\u2019s arrest, the reading of the implied consent notice, and Ledford\u2019s refusal to\n\nconsent to a test. After establishing that the officer\u2019s patrol car was equipped with a\n\ncamera that took a video, the following transpired:\n\n      Q.       Was the camera functioning on the day you had this interaction\n      with the defendant?\n      A.       Yes, ma\u2019am.\n      Q.       And have you had a chance to view the video prior to testifying\n      today?\n      A.       Yes, ma\u2019am.\n      Q.       Was it a fair and accurate recording of the events that took place\n      that day?\n      A.       Yes, ma\u2019am.\n      Q.       Were there any additions, deletions or alterations to that video?\n      A.       Yes, ma\u2019am, for the HGN.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f      Ledford\u2019s counsel promptly moved for a mistrial based upon the reference to\n\nthe HGN test, and the trial court granted it. During subsequent discussions about\n\nscheduling the case for a retrial, Ledford\u2019s counsel advised the trial court that he had\n\nfiled a plea in bar, and the trial court responded, \u201cI\u2019m probably not going to grant it\n\nbecause it has to be intentional on the part of the State. And I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m\n\ngoing to be able to find intentionality on their part.\u201d Ledford\u2019s counsel then argued:\n\n      Your Honor, I don\u2019t blame any intention on the part of the solicitor\u2019s\n      office. But I do find that it\u2019s quite intentional on behalf of the officer.\n      And, Your Honor, before we got started with trial, after the trial and\n      around the lunch break, my client overheard the solicitor\u2019s office\n      mentioning that the officer really needed to leave and she was leaving\n      by 1:30. And it\u2019s amazing that her departure - - what she blurted out was\n      - - came out at almost exactly 1:30 when we were about to start the\n      video and go on with the case. And it came with 10 to 15 minutes of us\n      telling her - - at least me instructing her in open court, on the record, that\n      we\u2019re not going to make any mention of the horizontal gaze nystagmus.\n      I find that that\u2019s intentional on her part.\n\n\nThe State explained:\n\n      You Honor, . . . when [the officer] was asked if the video in question\n      had been altered, she said only the HGN but she truthfully answered an\n      artfully (sic) worded question. And it wasn\u2019t - - but it wasn\u2019t to\n      intentionally draw attention to the fact that the HGN existed. Certainly,\n\n\n                                            4\n\f       I could have phrased the question better but it was not intentional on my\n       part and it wasn\u2019t the intention of [the o]fficer [] either. I was asking a\n       standard foundational question to admit a video.\n\n\nThe trial court denied the plea in bar based upon the following findings:\n\n              There has to be a finding by the Court that it was something that\n       was done intentionally by the prosecutor. The prosecutor is the state of\n       Georgia represented by the solicitor general not a police officer.\n              The police officer is just their witness. And when asked a\n       question, the witness is required to answer truthfully. And [the officer]\n       was asked a question, that is a foundational question, . . . which is\n       routine in the course of establishing the authenticity of a video. And by\n       answering truthfully she brought that issue up that had been ruled on by\n       the Court. But I don\u2019t find that it is such that it rises to the level of\n       misconduct or intentional acts on behalf of the State.\n\n\n       On appeal, we must uphold the trial court\u2019s finding on the issue of the\n\nprosecutor\u2019s intent unless it is clearly erroneous.
