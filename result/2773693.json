Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Lauderdale County, Dareadell \u201cTerrell\u201d\n\nThompson was convicted of wire fraud and sentenced to five years in the custody of the\n\fMississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with four years suspended, one year to be\n\nserved on house arrest, and five years of supervised probation. Thompson appeals. Finding\n\nno error, we affirm.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b62.    Thompson was employed as a police officer with the City of Meridian Police\n\nDepartment (MPD). On January 11, 2008, MPD Detective Rita Jack filed a grievance\n\nagainst Thompson with MPD\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs (Internal Affairs). The grievance\n\nalleged that Thompson had forged Jack\u2019s signature, and the signature of Municipal Judge\n\nRobbie Jones, on a subpoena that Thompson issued to AT&T in order to obtain cellular-\n\ntelephone records. MPD conducted an internal investigation headed by Lieutenant Dean\n\nHarper, head of MPD\u2019s Internal Affairs Division. According to Harper, he headed the\n\ninvestigation up to a certain point, then reported to MPD Police Chief B.D. Dubose, who\n\ncontinued the investigation to its conclusion.\n\n\u00b63.    On January 22, 2008, at Chief Dubose\u2019s request, Thompson underwent a polygraph\n\nexamination.    The polygraph examination was administered by Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation Agent T.J. Sypniewski. Prior to the examination, Agent Sypniewski advised\n\nThompson of his Miranda rights, and Thompson signed a Miranda rights waiver form.\n\nAccording to Agent Sypniewski, after the polygraph examination, Agent Sypniewski advised\n\nThompson that he found Thompson\u2019s responses to be deceptive. Thompson then told Agent\n\nSypniewski that he suspected that his wife was communicating with a man with whom she\n\nhad a previous affair, and that he forged the signatures of both Detective Jack and Judge\n\nJones on the subpoena and faxed the subpoena to AT&T in order to obtain his wife\u2019s\n\n                                             2\n\ftelephone records.1\n\n\u00b64.    During the internal investigation, Chief Dubose consulted Mississippi Highway Patrol\n\nInvestigator Danny Knight about the criminal nature of Thompson\u2019s actions. After being\n\nbriefed on the incident, Investigator Knight told Chief Dubose that, in his opinion, the matter\n\nshould be handled internally. At the conclusion of the internal investigation, Chief Dubose\n\nreported the forgery of the signatures on the subpoena to the mayor of Meridian and\n\nrequested that disciplinary action be taken. On February 26, 2008, Chief Dubose issued a\n\ndisciplinary-action letter to Thompson, in which Chief Dubose summarized the findings of\n\nthe internal investigation 2 and informed Thompson of MPD\u2019s intent to terminate Thompson\u2019s\n\nemployment. In a letter to Meridian Mayor John Smith, dated March 10, 2008, Chief Dubose\n\nrecommended that disciplinary action be taken against Thompson in lieu of his termination.\n\nOn March 18, 2008, Chief Dubose issued a revised disciplinary-action letter informing\n\nThompson that MPD was taking disciplinary action against him in lieu of termination. As\n\na result of his misconduct, Thompson was suspended without pay for a period of ten weeks\n\nand demoted to the rank of police orderly, with a twelve-month probationary period. The\n\nletter further informed Thompson that he would not be considered for a promotion for a\n\nperiod of two years, and that he was required to undergo twelve months of mandatory\n\n\n\n       1\n        At trial, Agent Sypniewski only testified to what Thompson communicated to him.\nThe fact that a polygraph examination was conducted and the results of the examination\nwere excluded from evidence.\n       2\n         In summarizing the investigation, Chief Dubose stated that Investigator Knight was\ncalled in to investigate any possible criminal conduct that may have occurred as a result of\nThompson\u2019s conduct. Chief Dubose stated that \u201cInvestigator Knight . . . informed us that\n[the forgery incident] would be a misdemeanor case.\u201d\n\n                                              3\n\fcounseling.\n\n\u00b65.    In October 2009, Chief Dubose retired and was replaced by Chief Lee Shelbourn.\n\nAccording to Chief Shelbourn\u2019s testimony at trial, he met with Thompson on January 12,\n\n2010, regarding the forgery incident.3 During the meeting, Chief Shelbourn asked Thompson\n\nif he forged the signatures on the subpoena, and Thompson admitted that he forged the\n\nsignatures. Following the meeting, Chief Shelbourn referred the forgery incident to the\n\nAttorney General\u2019s Office for an independent criminal investigation.               Thompson\u2019s\n\nemployment with MPD was terminated on January 27, 2010.\n\n\u00b66.    Following a criminal investigation led by Investigator Roger Cribb of the Attorney\n\nGeneral\u2019s Office, Thompson was indicted for wire fraud in violation of Mississippi Code\n\nAnnotated section 97-19-83 (Rev. 2006) on August 12, 2011. Prior to trial, Thompson filed\n\na motion to dismiss attacking the sufficiency of the indictment and a motion to dismiss\n\narguing that his alleged criminal conduct constituted one of numerous misdemeanor offenses.\n\nThompson also filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any evidence related to the\n\npolygraph examination, and a motion in limine seeking to suppress any statements that he\n\nmade during the internal-affairs investigation, particularly statements made to Chief Dubose,\n\nAgent Sypniewski, and Chief Shelbourn admitting that he forged the signatures. Likewise,\n\nthe State filed several pretrial motions, including: a motion to prohibit the introduction of any\n\ntestimony or other evidence concerning the possible sentence that Thompson would be\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        At a motion hearing prior to trial, Chief Shelbourn testified that he met with\nThompson on January 12, 2010, regarding seven disciplinary issues, one of which was the\n2007 forgery incident.\n\n                                               4\n\fsubject to if found guilty; a motion to exclude evidence pertaining to any administrative,\n\npersonnel, or disciplinary action taken against Thompson by the MPD; and a motion to\n\nexclude any opinion testimony by Investigator Knight as to whether Thompson\u2019s actions\n\nconstituted a felony or a misdemeanor.\n\n\u00b67.    A hearing on the various motions was held on April 23, 2012, and June 14, 2012. On\n\nAugust 9, 2012, the trial court rendered its judgment on the various motions. The trial court\n\ndenied Thompson\u2019s motions to dismiss and his motion to suppress statements made during\n\nthe internal investigation. Thompson\u2019s motion to exclude any evidence related to the\n\npolygraph examination was granted; however, the alleged statement that Thompson made\n\nto Agent Sypniewski after the examination was not excluded. Likewise, the trial court\n\ngranted the State\u2019s motion to prohibit testimony concerning the possible sentence Thompson\n\ncould receive if found guilty, but denied the State\u2019s motion to exclude any evidence\n\npertaining to administrative, personnel, or disciplinary action taken against Thompson by the\n\nMPD. Finally, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to exclude any opinion testimony\n\nby Investigator Knight pertaining to whether Thompson\u2019s alleged conduct constituted a\n\nfelony or misdemeanor; however, the trial court ruled that Investigator Knight could give\n\nfactual testimony regarding his investigation and any evidence found during that\n\ninvestigation.\n\n\u00b68.    A jury trial was held on January 28-29, 2013. Thompson was found guilty of wire\n\nfraud and was sentenced to five years in the custody of the MDOC, with four years\n\nsuspended, one year to be served on house arrest, and five years of supervised probation.\n\nThompson now appeals raising the following issues: (1) whether the trial court erred by\n\n\n                                             5\n\ffailing to suppress statements he made during the internal investigation; and (2) whether he\n\nwas prohibited from presenting evidence supporting his theory of defense.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n       I.       Whether the trial court erred by failing to grant Thompson\u2019s\n                motion to suppress statements Thompson made during the\n                investigation.\n\n\u00b69.    Thompson asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress\n\nstatements that he made during the internal investigation.      Thompson argues that his\n\nstatements should have been suppressed because the statements were used in violation of the\n\nGarrity 4 rule in that he was compelled to answer questions or face termination, and promised\n\nthat any statements he made would be used solely for administrative disciplinary purposes.\n\n\u00b610.   A trial court\u2019s determination of whether a statement or a confession is voluntarily\n\ngiven is \u201cessentially a fact-finding function.\u201d Mettetal v. State, 602 So. 2d 864, 868 (Miss.\n\n1992) (quoting Stokes v. State, 548 So. 2d 118, 122 (Miss. 1989)). Thus, \u201c[a] trial court's\n\nfinding that a defendant\u2019s statements were voluntarily given cannot be reversed unless the\n\ncourt applied an erroneous legal standard or was clearly erroneous in its findings of fact.\u201d\n\nFulgham v. State, 46 So. 3d 315, 339 (\u00b677) (Miss. 2010) (citing Mettetal, 602 So. 2d at 868).\n\n\u00b611.   In Garrity, New Jersey police officers, who were under investigation for corruption,\n\nwere being questioned by the state attorney general\u2019s office. Garrity, 385 U.S. at 494. The\n\nofficers were advised that they did not have to answer any questions, and that anything they\n\nsaid could be used against them in a criminal proceeding; however, the officers were also\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493 (1967).\n\n                                             6\n\ftold that refusal to answer the questions would result in termination from their employment.\n\nId. The officers answered the questions and their statements were subsequently used against\n\nthem at trial. The United States Supreme Court found that the statements were coerced and\n\ntherefore inadmissable, holding:\n\n       The choice given [the officers] was either to forfeit their jobs or to incriminate\n       themselves. The option to lose their means of livelihood or to pay the penalty\n       of self-incrimination is the antithesis of free choice to speak out or to remain\n       silent. That practice . . . is likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as\n       to disable him from making a free and rational choice. We think the\n       statements were infected by the coercion inherent in this scheme of\n       questioning and cannot be sustained as voluntary under our prior decisions.\n\nId. at 497; see also Knebel v. City of Biloxi, 453 So. 2d 1037, 1040 (Miss. 1984) (extending\n\nGarrity to include promises as well as threats holding that \u201ca statement given under the\n\npromise that it will not be used against [the employee] in a criminal proceeding is likewise\n\ninadmissible\u201d). Therefore, statements made by a police officer, which result from either the\n\nthreat of termination if he does not answer or a promise that the statements will not be used\n\nin a criminal proceeding, are deemed to have been coerced and are therefore inadmissible in\n\na subsequent criminal proceeding. It follows that in order for Garrity to be implicated, there\n\nmust be some threat or promise to induce the statement.\n\n\u00b612.   At the suppression hearing, Thompson testified that during the investigation, he\n\nbelieved that he was required to participate in the investigation, and that if he failed to\n\ncooperate he would have been subject to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination\n\nfrom employment.\n\n\u00b613.   However, Chief Dubose testified that he did not, either expressly or impliedly,\n\nthreaten Thompson with termination from employment if Thompson refused to cooperate\n\n\n                                               7\n\fwith the investigation. Chief Dubose further testified that he did not promise Thompson that\n\nhe would not be prosecuted or that criminal charges would not be brought against him.\n\nChief Dubose stated that police officers enjoy the same constitutional protections as every\n\nother citizen and are not forced to incriminate themselves.\n\n\u00b614.   During the hearing, the State introduced MPD\u2019s General Orders into evidence.\n\nSection II.A of the General Orders provides:\n\n       [MPD] employees enjoy the same constitutional rights afforded any other\n       citizen of the United States and shall not be intimidated during internal\n       investigations, nor shall their constitutional rights be violated in any manner\n       . . . . During . . . an investigation, the officer . . . shall not be threatened with\n       transfer, dismissal[,] or disciplinary action as a result of his or her\n       constitutional rights.\n\nThompson testified that he was given a copy of the MPD\u2019s General Orders upon becoming\n\na police officer, that he was expected to know those orders, and that he was in fact familiar\n\nwith MPD\u2019s General Orders. Thompson further acknowledged that he understood the rights\n\nafforded to him by both Garrity and Miranda.5\n\n\u00b615.   Chief Shelbourn also testified at the supersession hearing. Chief Shelbourn stated that\n\nhe met with Thompson on January 12, 2010. According to Chief Shelbourn, the purpose of\n\nthe meeting was to discuss seven disciplinary issues in Thompson\u2019s personnel file. During\n\nthe meeting, Chief Shelbourn went over each disciplinary matter with Thompson and asked\n\nThompson \u201cdid you do this,\u201d and each time Thompson answered \u201cyes.\u201d Chief Shelbourn\n\ntestified that he did not tell Thompson that if he did not cooperate that his employment would\n\nbe terminated, and did not make any promises to induce Thompson to confess. According\n\n\n\n       5\n           Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n                                                8\n\fto Chief Shelbourn, Thompson was free to end the interview and leave at any time.\n\n\u00b616.   Furthermore, Thompson admitted that he voluntarily agreed to submit to the\n\npolygraph examination. Prior to undergoing the examination, Thompson was advised of his\n\nMiranda rights and signed an advice-of-rights form. Agent Sypniewski testified that he did\n\nnot have any contact with anyone from MPD prior to administering the examination.6 Agent\n\nSypniewski testified that, at the conclusion of the polygraph examination, he informed\n\nThompson that he found Thompson\u2019s answers to be deceptive; Thompson then admitted to\n\ncreating and faxing a \u201cbogus\u201d subpoena to AT&T. Agent Sypniewski testified that he did\n\nnot make promises of any kind to Thompson.\n\n\u00b617.   Based on the evidence and testimony at the hearing, the trial court found that\n\nThompson\u2019s statements were voluntarily given and made without the element of coercion\n\nnecessary to invoke Garrity. The trial court found \u201cno credible evidence that any threats or\n\npromises, either express or implied, were made to [Thompson] . . . to induce [him] into\n\nmaking any incriminating statements . . . .\u201d\n\n\u00b618.   Upon reviewing the record of the proceedings, we cannot say that the trial court\n\napplied an erroneous legal standard or was clearly erroneous in its findings of fact. Thus, we\n\nfind that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress\n\nhis statements to Chief Dubose, Chief Shelbourn, and Agent Sypniewski. Accordingly, this\n\nissue is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         According to Agent Sypniewski, Chief Dubose requested assistance from the FBI\nfield office. Agent Sypniewski was briefed by another agent and sent to conduct the\nexamination.\n\n                                               9\n\f       II.       Whether Thompson was prohibited from presenting evidence\n                 supporting his theory of defense.\n\n\u00b619.   Thompson next argues that the trial court prohibited him from presenting evidence in\n\nsupport of his theory of defense. According to Thompson, his theory of defense was that his\n\nalleged conduct was a misdemeanor that was handled internally by MPD. Thompson asserts\n\nthat by excluding certain evidence and testimony, and permitting the State to question\n\nwitnesses outside the scope of redirect examination, the trial court prevented him from\n\npresenting this theory of defense at trial.\n\n\u00b620.   This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Richardson v. State, 74 So. 3d 317, 329 (\u00b639) (Miss. 2011). The trial court must\n\nexercise its discretion \u201cwithin the confines of the Mississippi Rules of Evidence.\u201d Id. We\n\nreverse \u201conly if such discretion has been abused and a substantial right of a party has been\n\naffected.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b621.   We fail to see how the fact that Thompson\u2019s alleged conduct may conform to one of\n\nseveral misdemeanor offenses, in addition to a felony offense, is relevant to Thompson\u2019s\n\ntheory of defense at trial. Thompson was indicted on one count of wire fraud pursuant to\n\nMississippi Code Annotated section 97-19-83. Section 97-19-83 provides, in part:\n\n       Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to\n       defraud, or for obtaining . . . property or services, . . . by means of false or\n       fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises . . . for the purpose of\n       executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, transmits or causes\n       to be transmitted by mail, telephone, newspaper, radio, television, wire,\n       electromagnetic waves, microwaves, or other means of communication . . . any\n       writings, signs, signals, pictures, sounds, data, or other matter across county\n       or state jurisdictional lines, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not\n       more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or by imprisonment for not\n       more than five (5) years, or . . . both[.]\n\n\n                                               10\n\fThompson\u2019s indictment read, in part, that Thompson:\n\n       [B]etween the dates of December 20, 2007[,] through December 24, 2007, . .\n       . did wilfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously devise a scheme to obtain the\n       property of AT&T . . . by submitting a fraudulent Court Order/Subpoena for\n       the cell phone records of Stacy Thompson . . . to the AT&T National\n       Compliance Center. Said fraudulent Court Order/Subpoena was transmitted\n       by telephone, via facsimile, from Meridian, Mississippi[,] across state\n       jurisdictional lines to the State of Florida[.]\n\nThompson does not argue that his indictment was defective or insufficient; instead,\n\nThompson merely asserts that his alleged conduct more properly constituted one of several\n\nmisdemeanors, namely: impersonating a public officer or employee, impersonating an officer\n\nor state-agency employee, and unauthorized use of a name in communication.\n\n\u00b622.    Our caselaw is well settled that \u201cwhere two or more statutes govern a given course\n\nof conduct, the State may elect to proceed under either statute, so long as the accused is given\n\nfair notice of the crime charged.\u201d Hughes v. State, 106 So. 3d 836, 840 (\u00b610) (Miss. Ct. App.\n\n2012); see also Cumbest v. State, 456 So. 2d 209, 223 (Miss. 1984) (\u201cEven if the criminal\n\nstatutes cover the same criminal act in virtually the same language . . . and one provides for\n\na greater penalty than the other, the [S]tate . . . may proceed under either.\u201d); Smith v. State,\n\n106 So. 3d 877, 881 (\u00b611) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013) (\u201c[T]he State is under no obligation to\n\nprosecute under the statute with the lesser penalty. It may choose to prosecute under either,\n\nand so long as the choice is clear and unequivocal the defendant has no right to complain.\u201d);\n\nKeith v. State, 999 So. 2d 383, 392 (\u00b626) (Miss. Ct. App. 2008) (\u201cWhen a defendant's actions\n\nconstitute a crime under more than one statute, the State is not obligated to pursue criminal\n\ncharges under the statute with the lesser penalty, but may choose any applicable statute so\n\nlong as its choice is clear.\u201d).\n\n\n                                              11\n\f\u00b623.   Nevertheless, a defendant enjoys \u201can absolute right to have the jury instructed on\n\nlesser included offenses if the evidence supports such an instruction.\u201d Leagea v. State, 138\n\nSo. 3d 184, 188 (\u00b611) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013) (quoting Downs v. State, 962 So. 2d 1255, 1260\n\n(\u00b622) (Miss. 2007)). Here, the trial court properly instructed the jury as to possible lesser\n\nincluded offenses. The jury was given instructions on the lesser misdemeanor offenses of\n\nimpersonating a public officer or employee and unauthorized use of the name of another\n\nperson to a telegram, petition, or related communication. Thus, we find that Thompson was\n\nnot denied his right to present his theory of defense at trial. That notwithstanding, we will\n\naddress the merits of Thompson\u2019s claims.\n\n\u00b624.   According to Thompson, the trial court \u201ccrippled\u201d his ability to present his theory of\n\ndefense by: granting the State\u2019s motion in limine to prohibit Investigator Knight from\n\ntestifying that Thompson\u2019s alleged conduct was a misdemeanor; sustaining the State\u2019s\n\nobjections to the admittance of a letter from Chief Dubose to Thompson; and allowing the\n\nState to negate his defense by improperly questioning witnesses outside the scope of redirect\n\nexamination. We disagree.\n\n              A.     Investigator Knight\n\n\u00b625.   Thompson contends that the trial court erred in prohibiting him from presenting\n\nsupporting evidence of his theory of defense by granting the State\u2019s motion in limine to\n\nexclude the opinion testimony of Investigator Knight as to whether Thompson\u2019s alleged\n\nconduct constituted a felony or a misdemeanor.\n\n\u00b626.   \u201cThe admission of expert testimony is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial\n\njudge. Unless we conclude that the discretion was arbitrary and clearly erroneous, amounting\n\n\n                                             12\n\fto an abuse of discretion, that decision will stand.\u201d Holliday v. State, 758 So. 2d 1078, 1080\n\n(\u00b65) (Miss. Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Roberts v. Grafe Auto Co. Inc., 701 So. 2d 1093, 1098\n\n(Miss. 1997)).\n\n\u00b627.   Here, Investigator Knight was testifying as a lay witness and was not tendered as an\n\nexpert witness. However, Thompson sought to elicit Investigator Knight\u2019s opinion as to\n\nwhether Thompson\u2019s conduct constituted a misdemeanor or the felony crime of wire fraud.\n\nMississippi Rule of Evidence 701 provides:\n\n       If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness's testimony in the form\n       of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are\n       (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to the clear\n       understanding of the testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c)\n       not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the\n       scope of Rule 702.\n\nIn granting the State\u2019s motion in limine, the trial court excluded any opinion testimony by\n\nInvestigator Knight as to whether Thompson\u2019s conduct constituted a felony or a\n\nmisdemeanor. However, the trial court ruled that \u201c[Investigator] Knight [could] give factual\n\ntestimony regarding his investigation and the evidence found in the course of his\n\ninvestigation.\u201d\n\n\u00b628.   We find that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Investigator Knight\u2019s opinion testimony was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion. At trial, Investigator Knight testified that he never conducted an\n\ninvestigation into the forgery incident. Investigator Knight testified that his knowledge of\n\nThompson\u2019s conduct was based solely on what Chief Dubose told him. During cross-\n\nexamination, the following exchange occurred between the State and Investigator Knight:\n\n       Q.     So you never explored it criminally?\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       A.     No, sir.\n\n       ....\n\n       Q.     And [Investigator Knight,] . . . did you base [your] opinion solely on\n              what you heard from [Chief] Dubose . . . or did you base it on your\n              investigation?\n\n       A.     No, just solely [on] what I heard from the chief and his assistant chief.\n\nThus, Investigator Knight\u2019s opinion was not based on his own perception but on information\n\ngiven to him by Chief Dubose. Additionally, we do not see how Investigator Knight\u2019s\n\nopinion would be helpful to the fact-finder. The issue of whether the crime of wire fraud\n\noccurred was an issue for the jury to decide. See Holliday, 758 So. 2d at 1081 (\u00b68) (holding\n\nthat \u201c[t]he issue of whether [the crime] occurred was an issue for the jury to the decide\u201d).\n\nThus, even if Thompson tendered Investigator Knight as an expert witness, the trial court was\n\nwithin its discretion in excluding his opinion testimony because no special knowledge was\n\nneeded to aide the jury in determining whether Thompson committed wire fraud. Finally,\n\nthis issue is moot because, at trial, Investigator Knight testified that in his opinion, the\n\nincident \u201cwas a personnel matter . . . and my district commander . . . agreed.\u201d Thus, the\n\nexcluded testimony that Thompson complains of was ultimately presented to the jury. This\n\nissue is without merit.\n\n              B.     Letter from Chief Dubose to Thompson\n\n\u00b629.   Thompson next argues that the trial court erred in sustaining the State\u2019s objection to\n\nthe admission into evidence of a letter from the MPD to Thompson. Thompson argues that\n\nthis exclusion prohibited him from presenting his theory of defense, as this letter contained\n\ninformation pertaining to the administrative punishment that he received from MPD.\n\n\n                                             14\n\f\u00b630.   During Thompson\u2019s cross-examination of Mark McDonald, the City\u2019s chief\n\nadministrative officer, Charles Wright, Thompson\u2019s trial counsel, presented McDonald with\n\na letter, purportedly sent by Chief Dubose to Thompson on March 18, 2008, concerning\n\ndisciplinary action taken against Thompson by MPD.           Upon presenting the letter to\n\nMcDonald, the following exchange occurred between Wright; McDonald; Stanley\n\nAlexander, counsel for the State; and the trial court:\n\n       [Wright]:            Are you aware that on March 18th . . . Chief Dubose sent\n                            a letter concerning disciplinary action against\n                            [Thompson] on March 18, 2008?\n\n       [McDonald]:          To be specific on all of the issues that are in\n                            [Thompson\u2019s] file . . . .\n\n       ....\n\n       [Wright]:            I am asking you, are you familiar with this letter being\n                            sent to [Thompson] on March the 18th?\n\n       [McDonald]:          No, sir, not specifically.\n\n       [Wright]:            Okay . . . . I would like this marked for identification.\n\n       [Alexander]:         Your Honor, I am going to object . . . . He says he is not\n                            aware of the letter.\n\n       [Trial Court]:       I will sustain the objection.\n\n       [Wright]:            I would still like to have it [marked] for identification\n                            only.\n\n       [Trial Court]:       No sir. He . . . said he didn\u2019t know about it.\n\n       [Wright]:            Okay.\n\n       [Trial Court]:       You can ask Chief Dubose.\n\nMississippi Rule of Evidence 901 governs the requirement of authentication or identification\n\n\n                                             15\n\fof evidence. Rule 901 provides that authentication or identification is a condition precedent\n\nto admissibility.    M.R.E. 901(a).    The authentication or identification requirement is\n\n\u201csatisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its\n\nproponent claims.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b631.   Here, it is clear that McDonald did not have sufficient knowledge of the letter for the\n\npurposes of authentication or identification. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby sustaining the State\u2019s objection to the letter being marked for identification at that time.\n\nAs the trial court noted, nothing prevented Thompson from introducing the letter during\n\nChief Dubose\u2019s testimony, which Thompson did, and the letter was admitted into evidence\n\nat that time.\n\n                C.    Redirect Examination\n\n\u00b632.   Finally, Thompson argues that the trial court erred by permitting the State to \u201cnegate\u201d\n\nhis theory of defense by improperly questioning witnesses outside the scope of redirect\n\nexamination.\n\n\u00b633.   \u201cThe scope of redirect examination, while largely within the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt, is limited to matters brought out during cross-examination.\u201d Lloyd v. State, 755 So.\n\n2d 12, 14 (\u00b69) (Miss. Ct. App. 1999). However, \u201cwe will not disturb a trial court's ruling on\n\nmatters pertaining to redirect examination unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d\n\nId.\n\n\u00b634.   The line of questioning that Thompson complains of involved hypothetical questions\n\nthat sought to elicit the fact that a person\u2019s misconduct may result in both termination from\n\nemployment and criminal charges.         For instance, during the redirect examination of\n\n\n                                              16\n\fMcDonald, the following exchange occurred between the State and McDonald:\n\n       Q.      [I]f an employee [who] works for the City . . . embezzles some money\n               from the City . . . would that person be subject to termination?\n\n       A.      Yes, sir.\n\n       Q.      Would you also turn that person over to the police . . . ?\n\nLikewise, during the redirect examination of Investigator Cribb, the following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\n       Q.       All right. If you got a DUI driving home, what do you think your boss\n       . . . . What would he do to you?\n\n       A.      He\u2019d fire me.\n\n       Q.      Now, would that stop the [police department] . . . from prosecuting you\n               for a DUI? 7\n\n\u00b635.   We disagree with Thompson\u2019s assertion that these questions were outside the scope\n\nof redirect examination. In each instance, this line of questioning was in response to\n\nThompson\u2019s questions during cross-examination. For instance, during Thompson\u2019s cross-\n\nexamination of McDonald, Thompson questioned McDonald regarding the City\u2019s decision\n\nto refer the matter to the Attorney General\u2019s Office and asked: \u201cNow, were you aware in your\n\ninvestigation in the City\u2019s disposition of [Thompson] that . . . these alleged forgeries . . . were\n\nhandled administratively?\u201d Likewise, during the cross-examination of Investigator Cribb,\n\nThompson asked: \u201cAre you aware that [Thompson] was disciplined by [MPD] in March of\n\n2010 for this Robbie Jones/Rita Jack subpoena?\u201d\n\n\u00b636.   It is clear that Thompson, through his questioning, was attempting to establish that\n\n       7\n       A similar hypothetical question was used during the redirect examination of Chief\nDubose and Chief Shelbourn.\n\n                                                17\n\fThompson was already punished administratively for his misconduct. Thus, the State\u2019s\n\nattempt to blunt this fact on redirect examination by demonstrating that administrative\n\npunishment does not preclude criminal charges was properly within the scope of redirect\n\nexamination. Accordingly, this issue is without merit.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b637.   We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Thompson\u2019s\n\nmotion to suppress statements that Thompson made during the internal investigation. The\n\ntrial court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, nor did the trial court apply an\n\nerroneous legal standard in finding that Thompson\u2019s statements were voluntarily given and\n\nmade without the element of coercion necessary to invoke Garrity. Likewise, we find that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence and that\n\nThompson was not improperly prohibited from presenting his theory of defense at trial.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\u00b638.

Following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Lauderdale County, Dareadell \u201cTerrell\u201d\n\nThompson was convicted of wire fraud and sentenced to five years in the custody of the\n\fMississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with four years suspended, one year to be\n\nserved on house arrest, and five years of supervised probation. Thompson appeals. Finding\n\nno error, we affirm.\n\n                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b62.    Thompson was employed as a police officer with the City of Meridian Police\n\nDepartment (MPD). On January 11, 2008, MPD Detective Rita Jack filed a grievance\n\nagainst Thompson with MPD\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs (Internal Affairs). The grievance\n\nalleged that Thompson had forged Jack\u2019s signature, and the signature of Municipal Judge\n\nRobbie Jones, on a subpoena that Thompson issued to AT&T in order to obtain cellular-\n\ntelephone records. MPD conducted an internal investigation headed by Lieutenant Dean\n\nHarper, head of MPD\u2019s Internal Affairs Division. According to Harper, he headed the\n\ninvestigation up to a certain point, then reported to MPD Police Chief B.D. Dubose, who\n\ncontinued the investigation to its conclusion.\n\n\u00b63.    On January 22, 2008, at Chief Dubose\u2019s request, Thompson underwent a polygraph\n\nexamination.    The polygraph examination was administered by Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation Agent T.J. Sypniewski. Prior to the examination, Agent Sypniewski advised\n\nThompson of his Miranda rights, and Thompson signed a Miranda rights waiver form.\n\nAccording to Agent Sypniewski, after the polygraph examination, Agent Sypniewski advised\n\nThompson that he found Thompson\u2019s responses to be deceptive. Thompson then told Agent\n\nSypniewski that he suspected that his wife was communicating with a man with whom she\n\nhad a previous affair, and that he forged the signatures of both Detective Jack and Judge\n\nJones on the subpoena and faxed the subpoena to AT&T in order to obtain his wife\u2019s\n\n                                             2\n\ftelephone records.1\n\n\u00b64.    During the internal investigation, Chief Dubose consulted Mississippi Highway Patrol\n\nInvestigator Danny Knight about the criminal nature of Thompson\u2019s actions. After being\n\nbriefed on the incident, Investigator Knight told Chief Dubose that, in his opinion, the matter\n\nshould be handled internally. At the conclusion of the internal investigation, Chief Dubose\n\nreported the forgery of the signatures on the subpoena to the mayor of Meridian and\n\nrequested that disciplinary action be taken. On February 26, 2008, Chief Dubose issued a\n\ndisciplinary-action letter to Thompson, in which Chief Dubose summarized the findings of\n\nthe internal investigation 2 and informed Thompson of MPD\u2019s intent to terminate Thompson\u2019s\n\nemployment. In a letter to Meridian Mayor John Smith, dated March 10, 2008, Chief Dubose\n\nrecommended that disciplinary action be taken against Thompson in lieu of his termination.\n\nOn March 18, 2008, Chief Dubose issued a revised disciplinary-action letter informing\n\nThompson that MPD was taking disciplinary action against him in lieu of termination. As\n\na result of his misconduct, Thompson was suspended without pay for a period of ten weeks\n\nand demoted to the rank of police orderly, with a twelve-month probationary period. The\n\nletter further informed Thompson that he would not be considered for a promotion for a\n\nperiod of two years, and that he was required to undergo twelve months of mandatory\n\n\n\n       1\n        At trial, Agent Sypniewski only testified to what Thompson communicated to him.\nThe fact that a polygraph examination was conducted and the results of the examination\nwere excluded from evidence.\n       2\n         In summarizing the investigation, Chief Dubose stated that Investigator Knight was\ncalled in to investigate any possible criminal conduct that may have occurred as a result of\nThompson\u2019s conduct. Chief Dubose stated that \u201cInvestigator Knight . . . informed us that\n[the forgery incident] would be a misdemeanor case.\u201d\n\n                                              3\n\fcounseling.\n\n\u00b65.    In October 2009, Chief Dubose retired and was replaced by Chief Lee Shelbourn.\n\nAccording to Chief Shelbourn\u2019s testimony at trial, he met with Thompson on January 12,\n\n2010, regarding the forgery incident.3 During the meeting, Chief Shelbourn asked Thompson\n\nif he forged the signatures on the subpoena, and Thompson admitted that he forged the\n\nsignatures. Following the meeting, Chief Shelbourn referred the forgery incident to the\n\nAttorney General\u2019s Office for an independent criminal investigation.               Thompson\u2019s\n\nemployment with MPD was terminated on January 27, 2010.\n\n\u00b66.    Following a criminal investigation led by Investigator Roger Cribb of the Attorney\n\nGeneral\u2019s Office, Thompson was indicted for wire fraud in violation of Mississippi Code\n\nAnnotated section 97-19-83 (Rev. 2006) on August 12, 2011. Prior to trial, Thompson filed\n\na motion to dismiss attacking the sufficiency of the indictment and a motion to dismiss\n\narguing that his alleged criminal conduct constituted one of numerous misdemeanor offenses.\n\nThompson also filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any evidence related to the\n\npolygraph examination, and a motion in limine seeking to suppress any statements that he\n\nmade during the internal-affairs investigation, particularly statements made to Chief Dubose,\n\nAgent Sypniewski, and Chief Shelbourn admitting that he forged the signatures. Likewise,\n\nthe State filed several pretrial motions, including: a motion to prohibit the introduction of any\n\ntestimony or other evidence concerning the possible sentence that Thompson would be\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        At a motion hearing prior to trial, Chief Shelbourn testified that he met with\nThompson on January 12, 2010, regarding seven disciplinary issues, one of which was the\n2007 forgery incident.\n\n                                               4\n\fsubject to if found guilty; a motion to exclude evidence pertaining to any administrative,\n\npersonnel, or disciplinary action taken against Thompson by the MPD; and a motion to\n\nexclude any opinion testimony by Investigator Knight as to whether Thompson\u2019s actions\n\nconstituted a felony or a misdemeanor.\n\n\u00b67.    A hearing on the various motions was held on April 23, 2012, and June 14, 2012. On\n\nAugust 9, 2012, the trial court rendered its judgment on the various motions. The trial court\n\ndenied Thompson\u2019s motions to dismiss and his motion to suppress statements made during\n\nthe internal investigation. Thompson\u2019s motion to exclude any evidence related to the\n\npolygraph examination was granted; however, the alleged statement that Thompson made\n\nto Agent Sypniewski after the examination was not excluded. Likewise, the trial court\n\ngranted the State\u2019s motion to prohibit testimony concerning the possible sentence Thompson\n\ncould receive if found guilty, but denied the State\u2019s motion to exclude any evidence\n\npertaining to administrative, personnel, or disciplinary action taken against Thompson by the\n\nMPD. Finally, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to exclude any opinion testimony\n\nby Investigator Knight pertaining to whether Thompson\u2019s alleged conduct constituted a\n\nfelony or misdemeanor; however, the trial court ruled that Investigator Knight could give\n\nfactual testimony regarding his investigation and any evidence found during that\n\ninvestigation.\n\n\u00b68.    A jury trial was held on January 28-29, 2013. Thompson was found guilty of wire\n\nfraud and was sentenced to five years in the custody of the MDOC, with four years\n\nsuspended, one year to be served on house arrest, and five years of supervised probation.\n\nThompson now appeals raising the following issues: (1) whether the trial court erred by\n\n\n                                             5\n\ffailing to suppress statements he made during the internal investigation; and (2) whether he\n\nwas prohibited from presenting evidence supporting his theory of defense.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n       I.       Whether the trial court erred by failing to grant Thompson\u2019s\n                motion to suppress statements Thompson made during the\n                investigation.\n\n\u00b69.    Thompson asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress\n\nstatements that he made during the internal investigation.      Thompson argues that his\n\nstatements should have been suppressed because the statements were used in violation of the\n\nGarrity 4 rule in that he was compelled to answer questions or face termination, and promised\n\nthat any statements he made would be used solely for administrative disciplinary purposes.\n\n\u00b610.   A trial court\u2019s determination of whether a statement or a confession is voluntarily\n\ngiven is \u201cessentially a fact-finding function.\u201d Mettetal v.

The option to lose their means of livelihood or to pay the penalty\n       of self-incrimination is the antithesis of free choice to speak out or to remain\n       silent. That practice . . . is likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as\n       to disable him from making a free and rational choice.

Therefore, statements made by a police officer, which result from either the\n\nthreat of termination if he does not answer or a promise that the statements will not be used\n\nin a criminal proceeding, are deemed to have been coerced and are therefore inadmissible in\n\na subsequent criminal proceeding. It follows that in order for Garrity to be implicated, there\n\nmust be some threat or promise to induce the statement.\n\n\u00b612.   At the suppression hearing, Thompson testified that during the investigation, he\n\nbelieved that he was required to participate in the investigation, and that if he failed to\n\ncooperate he would have been subject to disciplinary action up to, and including, termination\n\nfrom employment.\n\n\u00b613.   However, Chief Dubose testified that he did not, either expressly or impliedly,\n\nthreaten Thompson with termination from employment if Thompson refused to cooperate\n\n\n                                               7\n\fwith the investigation.

During the hearing, the State introduced MPD\u2019s General Orders into evidence.\n\nSection II.A of the General Orders provides:\n\n       [MPD] employees enjoy the same constitutional rights afforded any other\n       citizen of the United States and shall not be intimidated during internal\n       investigations, nor shall their constitutional rights be violated in any manner\n       . . . . During . . . an investigation, the officer . . . shall not be threatened with\n       transfer, dismissal[,] or disciplinary action as a result of his or her\n       constitutional rights.\n\nThompson testified that he was given a copy of the MPD\u2019s General Orders upon becoming\n\na police officer, that he was expected to know those orders, and that he was in fact familiar\n\nwith MPD\u2019s General Orders. Thompson further acknowledged that he understood the rights\n\nafforded to him by both Garrity and Miranda.5\n\n\u00b615.   Chief Shelbourn also testified at the supersession hearing. Chief Shelbourn stated that\n\nhe met with Thompson on January 12, 2010. According to Chief Shelbourn, the purpose of\n\nthe meeting was to discuss seven disciplinary issues in Thompson\u2019s personnel file. During\n\nthe meeting, Chief Shelbourn went over each disciplinary matter with Thompson and asked\n\nThompson \u201cdid you do this,\u201d and each time Thompson answered \u201cyes.\u201d Chief Shelbourn\n\ntestified that he did not tell Thompson that if he did not cooperate that his employment would\n\nbe terminated, and did not make any promises to induce Thompson to confess.

Furthermore, Thompson admitted that he voluntarily agreed to submit to the\n\npolygraph examination. Prior to undergoing the examination, Thompson was advised of his\n\nMiranda rights and signed an advice-of-rights form. Agent Sypniewski testified that he did\n\nnot have any contact with anyone from MPD prior to administering the examination.6 Agent\n\nSypniewski testified that, at the conclusion of the polygraph examination, he informed\n\nThompson that he found Thompson\u2019s answers to be deceptive; Thompson then admitted to\n\ncreating and faxing a \u201cbogus\u201d subpoena to AT&T. Agent Sypniewski testified that he did\n\nnot make promises of any kind to Thompson.\n\n\u00b617.   Based on the evidence and testimony at the hearing, the trial court found that\n\nThompson\u2019s statements were voluntarily given and made without the element of coercion\n\nnecessary to invoke Garrity. The trial court found \u201cno credible evidence that any threats or\n\npromises, either express or implied, were made to [Thompson] . . . to induce [him] into\n\nmaking any incriminating statements . . . .\u201d\n\n\u00b618.   Upon reviewing the record of the proceedings, we cannot say that the trial court\n\napplied an erroneous legal standard or was clearly erroneous in its findings of fact. Thus, we\n\nfind that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Thompson\u2019s motion to suppress\n\nhis statements to Chief Dubose, Chief Shelbourn, and Agent Sypniewski. Accordingly, this\n\nissue is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         According to Agent Sypniewski, Chief Dubose requested assistance from the FBI\nfield office. Agent Sypniewski was briefed by another agent and sent to conduct the\nexamination.\n\n                                               9\n\f       II.

Thompson next argues that the trial court prohibited him from presenting evidence in\n\nsupport of his theory of defense. According to Thompson, his theory of defense was that his\n\nalleged conduct was a misdemeanor that was handled internally by MPD. Thompson asserts\n\nthat by excluding certain evidence and testimony, and permitting the State to question\n\nwitnesses outside the scope of redirect examination, the trial court prevented him from\n\npresenting this theory of defense at trial.\n\n\u00b620.   This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Richardson v.

We fail to see how the fact that Thompson\u2019s alleged conduct may conform to one of\n\nseveral misdemeanor offenses, in addition to a felony offense, is relevant to Thompson\u2019s\n\ntheory of defense at trial. Thompson was indicted on one count of wire fraud pursuant to\n\nMississippi Code Annotated section 97-19-83. Section 97-19-83 provides, in part:\n\n       Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to\n       defraud, or for obtaining . . . property or services, . . . by means of false or\n       fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises . . . for the purpose of\n       executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, transmits or causes\n       to be transmitted by mail, telephone, newspaper, radio, television, wire,\n       electromagnetic waves, microwaves, or other means of communication . . . any\n       writings, signs, signals, pictures, sounds, data, or other matter across county\n       or state jurisdictional lines, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not\n       more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or by imprisonment for not\n       more than five (5) years, or . . . both[.]\n\n\n                                               10\n\fThompson\u2019s indictment read, in part, that Thompson:\n\n       [B]etween the dates of December 20, 2007[,] through December 24, 2007, . .\n       . did wilfully, unlawfully[,] and feloniously devise a scheme to obtain the\n       property of AT&T . . . by submitting a fraudulent Court Order/Subpoena for\n       the cell phone records of Stacy Thompson . . . to the AT&T National\n       Compliance Center.

Thus, we find that Thompson was\n\nnot denied his right to present his theory of defense at trial. That notwithstanding, we will\n\naddress the merits of Thompson\u2019s claims.\n\n\u00b624.   According to Thompson, the trial court \u201ccrippled\u201d his ability to present his theory of\n\ndefense by: granting the State\u2019s motion in limine to prohibit Investigator Knight from\n\ntestifying that Thompson\u2019s alleged conduct was a misdemeanor; sustaining the State\u2019s\n\nobjections to the admittance of a letter from Chief Dubose to Thompson; and allowing the\n\nState to negate his defense by improperly questioning witnesses outside the scope of redirect\n\nexamination.

Here, Investigator Knight was testifying as a lay witness and was not tendered as an\n\nexpert witness. However, Thompson sought to elicit Investigator Knight\u2019s opinion as to\n\nwhether Thompson\u2019s conduct constituted a misdemeanor or the felony crime of wire fraud.\n\nMississippi Rule of Evidence 701 provides:\n\n       If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness's testimony in the form\n       of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are\n       (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to the clear\n       understanding of the testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c)\n       not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the\n       scope of Rule 702.\n\nIn granting the State\u2019s motion in limine, the trial court excluded any opinion testimony by\n\nInvestigator Knight as to whether Thompson\u2019s conduct constituted a felony or a\n\nmisdemeanor. However, the trial court ruled that \u201c[Investigator] Knight [could] give factual\n\ntestimony regarding his investigation and the evidence found in the course of his\n\ninvestigation.\u201d\n\n\u00b628.   We find that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Investigator Knight\u2019s opinion testimony was\n\nnot an abuse of discretion. At trial, Investigator Knight testified that he never conducted an\n\ninvestigation into the forgery incident. Investigator Knight testified that his knowledge of\n\nThompson\u2019s conduct was based solely on what Chief Dubose told him. During cross-\n\nexamination, the following exchange occurred between the State and Investigator Knight:\n\n       Q.     So you never explored it criminally?\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       A.     No, sir.\n\n       ....\n\n       Q.     And [Investigator Knight,] . . . did you base [your] opinion solely on\n              what you heard from [Chief] Dubose . . . or did you base it on your\n              investigation?\n\n       A.     No, just solely [on] what I heard from the chief and his assistant chief.\n\nThus, Investigator Knight\u2019s opinion was not based on his own perception but on information\n\ngiven to him by Chief Dubose. Additionally, we do not see how Investigator Knight\u2019s\n\nopinion would be helpful to the fact-finder. The issue of whether the crime of wire fraud\n\noccurred was an issue for the jury to decide. See Holliday, 758 So. 2d at 1081 (\u00b68) (holding\n\nthat \u201c[t]he issue of whether [the crime] occurred was an issue for the jury to the decide\u201d).\n\nThus, even if Thompson tendered Investigator Knight as an expert witness, the trial court was\n\nwithin its discretion in excluding his opinion testimony because no special knowledge was\n\nneeded to aide the jury in determining whether Thompson committed wire fraud. Finally,\n\nthis issue is moot because, at trial, Investigator Knight testified that in his opinion, the\n\nincident \u201cwas a personnel matter . . . and my district commander . . . agreed.\u201d Thus, the\n\nexcluded testimony that Thompson complains of was ultimately presented to the jury. This\n\nissue is without merit.\n\n              B.     Letter from Chief Dubose to Thompson\n\n\u00b629.   Thompson next argues that the trial court erred in sustaining the State\u2019s objection to\n\nthe admission into evidence of a letter from the MPD to Thompson. Thompson argues that\n\nthis exclusion prohibited him from presenting his theory of defense, as this letter contained\n\ninformation pertaining to the administrative punishment that he received from MPD.\n\n\n                                             14\n\f\u00b630.   During Thompson\u2019s cross-examination of Mark McDonald, the City\u2019s chief\n\nadministrative officer, Charles Wright, Thompson\u2019s trial counsel, presented McDonald with\n\na letter, purportedly sent by Chief Dubose to Thompson on March 18, 2008, concerning\n\ndisciplinary action taken against Thompson by MPD.           Upon presenting the letter to\n\nMcDonald, the following exchange occurred between Wright; McDonald; Stanley\n\nAlexander, counsel for the State; and the trial court:\n\n       [Wright]:            Are you aware that on March 18th . . . Chief Dubose sent\n                            a letter concerning disciplinary action against\n                            [Thompson] on March 18, 2008?\n\n       [McDonald]:          To be specific on all of the issues that are in\n                            [Thompson\u2019s] file . . . .\n\n       ....\n\n       [Wright]:            I am asking you, are you familiar with this letter being\n                            sent to [Thompson] on March the 18th?\n\n       [McDonald]:          No, sir, not specifically.\n\n       [Wright]:            Okay . . . . I would like this marked for identification.\n\n       [Alexander]:         Your Honor, I am going to object . . . . He says he is not\n                            aware of the letter.\n\n       [Trial Court]:       I will sustain the objection.\n\n       [Wright]:            I would still like to have it [marked] for identification\n                            only.\n\n       [Trial Court]:       No sir. He . . . said he didn\u2019t know about it.\n\n       [Wright]:            Okay.\n\n       [Trial Court]:       You can ask Chief Dubose.\n\nMississippi Rule of Evidence 901 governs the requirement of authentication or identification\n\n\n                                             15\n\fof evidence. Rule 901 provides that authentication or identification is a condition precedent\n\nto admissibility.    M.R.E. 901(a).    The authentication or identification requirement is\n\n\u201csatisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its\n\nproponent claims.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b631.   Here, it is clear that McDonald did not have sufficient knowledge of the letter for the\n\npurposes of authentication or identification. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby sustaining the State\u2019s objection to the letter being marked for identification at that time.\n\nAs the trial court noted, nothing prevented Thompson from introducing the letter during\n\nChief Dubose\u2019s testimony, which Thompson did, and the letter was admitted into evidence\n\nat that time.\n\n                C.    Redirect Examination\n\n\u00b632.   Finally, Thompson argues that the trial court erred by permitting the State to \u201cnegate\u201d\n\nhis theory of defense by improperly questioning witnesses outside the scope of redirect\n\nexamination.\n\n\u00b633.   \u201cThe scope of redirect examination, while largely within the discretion of the trial\n\ncourt, is limited to matters brought out during cross-examination.\u201d Lloyd v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 12, 14 (\u00b69) (Miss. Ct. App. 1999). However, \u201cwe will not disturb a trial court's ruling on\n\nmatters pertaining to redirect examination unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d\n\nId.\n\n\u00b634.   The line of questioning that Thompson complains of involved hypothetical questions\n\nthat sought to elicit the fact that a person\u2019s misconduct may result in both termination from\n\nemployment and criminal charges.         For instance, during the redirect examination of\n\n\n                                              16\n\fMcDonald, the following exchange occurred between the State and McDonald:\n\n       Q.      [I]f an employee [who] works for the City . . . embezzles some money\n               from the City . . . would that person be subject to termination?\n\n       A.      Yes, sir.\n\n       Q.      Would you also turn that person over to the police . . . ?\n\nLikewise, during the redirect examination of Investigator Cribb, the following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\n       Q.       All right. If you got a DUI driving home, what do you think your boss\n       . . . . What would he do to you?\n\n       A.      He\u2019d fire me.\n\n       Q.      Now, would that stop the [police department] . . . from prosecuting you\n               for a DUI? 7\n\n\u00b635.   We disagree with Thompson\u2019s assertion that these questions were outside the scope\n\nof redirect examination. In each instance, this line of questioning was in response to\n\nThompson\u2019s questions during cross-examination. For instance, during Thompson\u2019s cross-\n\nexamination of McDonald, Thompson questioned McDonald regarding the City\u2019s decision\n\nto refer the matter to the Attorney General\u2019s Office and asked: \u201cNow, were you aware in your\n\ninvestigation in the City\u2019s disposition of [Thompson] that . . . these alleged forgeries . . . were\n\nhandled administratively?\u201d Likewise, during the cross-examination of Investigator Cribb,\n\nThompson asked: \u201cAre you aware that [Thompson] was disciplined by [MPD] in March of\n\n2010 for this Robbie Jones/Rita Jack subpoena?\u201d\n\n\u00b636.   It is clear that Thompson, through his questioning, was attempting to establish that\n\n       7\n       A similar hypothetical question was used during the redirect examination of Chief\nDubose and Chief Shelbourn.\n\n                                                17\n\fThompson was already punished administratively for his misconduct. Thus, the State\u2019s\n\nattempt to blunt this fact on redirect examination by demonstrating that administrative\n\npunishment does not preclude criminal charges was properly within the scope of redirect\n\nexamination. Accordingly, this issue is without merit.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b637.   We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Thompson\u2019s\n\nmotion to suppress statements that Thompson made during the internal investigation. The\n\ntrial court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous, nor did the trial court apply an\n\nerroneous legal standard in finding that Thompson\u2019s statements were voluntarily given and\n\nmade without the element of coercion necessary to invoke Garrity. Likewise, we find that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence and that\n\nThompson was not improperly prohibited from presenting his theory of defense at trial.\n\nAccordingly, the judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\u00b638.
