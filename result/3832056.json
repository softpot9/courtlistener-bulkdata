We find that in all the states that were admitted by an act of Congress, and not by proclamation of the President, the state courts, with provisions in their schedules of their Constitutions permitting such jurisdiction, have exercised the same in cases like the one at bar, and why should the state courts of Oklahoma likewise not exercise like jurisdiction? It undoubtedly is in accordance with the rule laid down in <em>Benner v. Porter,</em> 9 How. (U.S.) 235, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86557\"><a href=\"/opinion/86557/benner-v-porter/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, being necessary for the Congress to concur in order for the jurisdiction to attach to the state courts. And unquestionably <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 370</span> \nwhere a state had formed a Constitution and provided therein that the state courts should become the successors of like courts under the territorial form of government, and that as to criminal cases, not of a federal nature, the same should be prosecuted to final judgment in such court; that when Congress admitted such a state into the Union with such a provision in its Constitution it expressly concurred in and agreed to such provision. In the case of West Virginia, Nevada, Colorado, North and South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Utah, and Oklahoma, where the Constitutions were formed under an enabling act, and by virtue of that enabling act a proclamation was issued by the President of the United States admitting such state or states into the Union under the Constitution thus formed containing like provisions in like manner, did not the federal government concur in such provisions in like manner as if such states had been admitted directly by act of Congress? Should it be urged by counsel that the President had no such constitutional authority, he would be contending for a proposition that would be tantamount to declaring that Oklahoma was not legally in the Union of states. This court certainly will not make such a declaration  &#8212; will not repudiate the power that brought it into active existence.</p>\n<p>So far as we have been able to find from the date of the admission of Vermont in 1791 to that of Oklahoma in 1907 no provision has ever been made by express act of Congress for the prosecution of criminal offenses, not of a federal nature, where proceedings had not been instituted prior to the admission of the state into the Union, and prior to the supplemental legislation relative to Florida and Iowa in 1847 no provision has ever been made relative to pending criminal cases, not of a federal nature. It would be very salutary to consider the particular contemporaneous and subsequent practical construction of the powers of the states through their courts as successors to the territorial courts to prosecute to final determination pending cases or offenses committed, but where prosecutions had not been begun at the time of the admission of the state into <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 371</span> \nthe Union. For where there has been a particular construction which has been acquiesced in for a considerable period, considerations in favor of adhering to this construction seem to present themselves to the courts with such plausibility and force that is not easy to resist. Indeed, where a particular construction has been generally accepted as correct, and especially where this has occurred contemporaneously with the adoption of the Constitution or statute, and by those who had opportunity to understand the intention of the instrument, it is not to be denied that the presumption exists that the construction rightly interprets the intention. And when this has been given by officers in the discharge of their official duty, and rights have accrued in reliance upon it, which would be divested by the decision that the construction was erroneous, the argument <em>ab inconvenienti</em> is sometimes allowed to have very great weight. <em>Stuart v.

Among the grounds embraced in the motion in arrest are the following: Because said prosecution was not carried on in the name or by the authority of the republic of Texas. Mr. Justice Wheeler, speaking for the court, said:</p>\n<p>\"No prescribed form of words is necessary in order that the prosecution be carried on 'in the name and by the authority of the republic of Texas.'

Afterwards, the Supreme Court of the state of Iowa at its July term, 1847, reversed said cause. Mr. Justice Kenny said:</p>\n<p>\"The record entry of the clerk shows that the jury found the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 377</span> \ndefendants guilty only. The verdict of the jury as contained in the bill of exceptions shows that the jury found them guilty, and assessed their fine at three dollars and fifty cents, and imprisonment one hour. In the first there is error, as the jury should have assessed the fine. In the latter, there is also error, as the jury had no right to fix the time of imprisonment. In the judgment there is error, as the court, under the statute, in a case of this kind, had no right to fine the defendants. As the verdict upon the record is erroneous, it is not necessary to pass upon the other points raised by the assignment of error, or to determine whether the court had a right to amend the verdict after the jury had dispersed. If the verdict had been amended, it should appear in legal form upon the record. The judgment of the court below will therefore be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Bonsell v. United States,</em> 1 G.

A verdict of the jury impaneled and sworn to try the cause on the plea of not guilty was rendered, finding him guilty of the charge in the indictment. The judgment of the territorial court was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state.</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>State v. Douglass,</em> 1 G. Greene (Iowa) 550, the defendant was prosecuted before a justice of the peace of the territory for an assault. Tried by a jury, verdict of guilty rendered, and fine assessed at $5. The cause was then taken to the district court of the state by writ of <em>certiorari</em> and there reversed, and was then taken upon a writ of error from the district court upon the part of the state to the Supreme Court.

Geary, sitting as judge of the court of first instance, in the district of San Francisco, territory of Upper California, the defendant being charged with the crime of murder. Hastings, C. J., for the court said:</p>\n<p>\"It will be unnecessary to enter into a detail of the proceedings in this case, from the fact that the laws of the country then in force were but imperfectly understood, and error and irregularity are found in all the proceedings of the courts, especially in criminal cases. The errors in this record are so numerous that the execution of the defendant would not be the judgment of the law, but the mere will of the court and executioner.

At the January term, 1865, of the state Supreme Court, this cause was reversed on account of errors occurring at the trial, without any reference to the crime having been one committed and tried under the territorial government.

An appeal was prosecuted after statehood to the Supreme Court on account of refusal of instructions as to the law governing the case.

Before the day of execution arrived the Governor of the then territory of Nevada issued in his official capacity a paper purporting to be a commutation of the sentence of Janes, and directing him to be delivered over by the sheriff of Storey county to the warden of the territorial prison or penitentiary, and requiring the warden to hold him in prison <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 381</span> \nduring his natural life. By authority of this paper and none other, he was delivered over to the warden some time in 1864, and by him retained in custody. On the 3d day of December, 1864. J. W. Nye, then acting as Governor of the state of Nevada, under the provisions of the Constitution which continued the territorial Governor in that position until the election and qualification of the new state officers issued another paper granting, or purporting to grant, a pardon to the petitioner, coupled with two conditions: First. That the pardon should not take effect for six months. Second. That the petitioner should leave the state of Nevada, and not return thereto. At the end of six months from the date of this paper the warden of the penitentiary released the prisoner, and he left the state. Upon being informed by the warden that his authority to release him had been questioned, and a request made that he would return and deliver himself up until the law governing the case could be settled, he voluntarily returned, delivered himself to the warden, and sued out this writ. The first question to determine was, was Janes originally committed to the keeping of the warden by any legal authority? Under the or organic act of the territory the Governor had the power to pardon persons who had been convicted of murder. The general power to pardon carried with it the power to pardon on conditions. If a condition precedent be imposed, that condition must be performed, or the pardon never takes effect. The following was the judgment of the Supreme Court of said state:</p>\n<p>\"Under the provisions of this section the prisoner is ordered to be delivered into the hands of the sheriff of Storey county, to be by him held until further orders of the district court of the First judicial district. Whether the original judgment directing the execution of the prisoner was sufficiently specific to have justified the sheriff in carrying the sentence into execution, need not be determined in this proceeding. Doubtless the district court can enter a sufficient judgment. We are satisfied the sheriff had no authority to release the prisoner, nor to intrust him to the custody of any other person than the jailor of Storey county, or some deputy or bailiff of the sheriff for safe keeping.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 382</span> </p>\n<p>In the case of <em>State v.

The indictment charged that said murder was committed by the prisoner in Hinsdale county on the 1st of March, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 383</span> \n1874; said Hinsdale county then being in the territory of Colorado, but at the time of the trial in the state of Colorado. The jury returned a verdict as charged in the indictment. Beck, C. J., said:</p>\n<p>\"The objection made to the concluding clause of the indictment appears to us to be wholly without merit. It was that the indictment concludes that the killing was committed against the peace and dignity of the people of the state of Colorado; whereas, say the counsel, there was no state of Colorado in existence at the time of the killing in March, 1874. True, the form of government has been changed since the latter date from the territorial form to that of a state. The views of Attorney General Urmy, that no rights were forfeited by the transition, is an answer to this whole line of argument. The same citizens who comprised the territorial government were the citizens who framed and adopted the state Constitution; and upon its taking effect they immediately became citizens of the new state. Instead of sweeping away by a dash of the pen the laws which had been made by this same citizenship, and by which the territory had been governed for many years, the whole body of laws was preserved by the Constitution as the laws of the state, both in civil and in criminal matters, until they should be amended or repealed by the state Legislature, and other provisions made to supply their place.\"</p>\n<p>Montana: Section 3, Schedule, Const. 1889:</p>\n<p>\"No crime or criminal offense committed against the laws of the territory of Montana shall abate, or be in any wise affected, by reason of the change from a territorial to a state form of government; but the same shall be deemed and taken to be an offense against the laws of the state, and the appropriate courts of the state shall have jurisdiction over and to hear and determine the same: Provided, that this section shall not in any wise be construed to change the law of the statute of limitations, or the due effect or application of the same.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of the <em>State v.

The contention of the appellant is that, inasmuch as there was nothing in either the enabling act which authorized the organization of the state of Washington, or in the Constitution of the state, which in express language authorized this court to remand cases to the superior courts of the state for further proceedings, the superior court had no jurisdiction in this instance, but that if any commitment could be issued by any court it must have been issued by this court. The court said: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 388</span> </p>\n<p>\"We shall not enter upon any review or discussion of the several portions of the enabling act and the Constitution which operated to transfer causes pending in the Supreme Court of the territory of Washington to the Supreme Court of the state of Washington. They are clear and unmistakable in their language, and the appellant makes no contention that they did not have the effect to give this court jurisdiction to try and determine the former case. The mistake which appellant makes in this matter is found, we think, in that he overlooks the fact that, when this court came into existence and took possession of cases pending in the territorial Supreme Court, it also acquired all the powers of the former territorial court under the statutes of the territory, one of which was to remand cases to the successors of the former territorial district courts, namely, the superior courts, for execution of its judgments.

The case was first tried when Utah was a territory, and by a jury composed of twelve persons. Both of the defendants were found guilty as charged, and were recommended to the mercy of the court. A new trial having been granted, the case was removed for trial to another county. But it was not again tried until after the admission of Utah into the Union as a state. At the second trial the defendant was found guilty. He moved for a new trial upon the ground, among others, that the jury that tried him was composed of only eight jurors; whereas, by the law in force at the time of the commission of the alleged offense, a lawful jury in his case could not be composed of less than twelve jurors. The application for a new trial having been overruled, the accused having been called for sentence, he renewed his objection to the composition of the jury, and moved by counsel that the verdict be set aside and another trial ordered. This objection was overruled, the accused duly excepting to the action of the court. He was then sentenced to the state prison for a term of three years. The judgment of conviction was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Utah, the court holding that the trial of the accused by a jury composed of eight persons was consistent of the Constitution of the United States. By the statutes of the territory of Utah in force at the time of the commission of the alleged offense, it was provided that a trial jury in the district court should consist of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 392</span> \ntwelve, and in a justice's court of six, persons, unless the parties to the action or proceeding, in other than criminal cases, agreed upon a less number. * * *\"</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of the United States further said:</p>\n<p>\"In our opinion the provision in the Constitution of Utah, providing for the trial in courts of general jurisdiction of criminal cases, not capital, by a jury composed of eight persons, is <em>ex post facto</em> in its application to felonies committed before the territory became a state, because in respect of such crimes the Constitution of the United States gave the accused, at the time of the commission of his offense, the right to be tried by a jury of twelve persons, and made it impossible to deprive him of his liberty except by the unanimous verdict of such a jury.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>State v.

A. 33, the defendant was tried upon an indictment charging him with the murder of John Nordquist, the crime having been committed prior to the admission of the state into the Union.

The judgment of the lower court was affirmed.</p>\n<p>District of Columbia: When Virginia in 1789 ceded a portion of said territory to the United States government, it provided that jurisdiction of the laws of said commonwealth over individuals residing within the limits of such cession should not cease or determine until Congress, having accepted the cession, should by law provide for the government thereof. Congress (Act July 16, 1790, c. 28, 1 Stat. 130, Act March 3, 1791, c. 17, 1 Stat. 214) adopted such cession, and provided that the operation of the laws of the state within such district should not be affected until Congress should otherwise provide by law. In the case of <em>United States v. Heinegan,</em> 1 Cranch (C. C.) 50, 26 Fed. Cas. 253, No. 15,340, an offense committed prior to the consummation of said cession in such territory, against the commonwealth of Virginia, was prosecuted in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, as an offense against the United States, to final judgment. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 393</span> </p>\n<p>There are unquestionably many other state cases of like import, but these are sufficient to show the settled policy of the Congress from 1792, when Kentucky was admitted, until 1896, when Utah joined the Union of states; one unbroken line, acquiesced in without even a protest.</p>\n<p>In the case of Florida there is no provision in the Constitution (1838) under which it was admitted for the transfer of cases not of a federal nature from the state courts that expressly became the successors of the superior courts of the territory to the federal courts following after statehood.

It has remained until the forty-sixth state was admitted before this power was ever questioned in any forum.</p>\n<p>It is seriously contended for the first time, so far as we can find, that it is not within the power of Congress to provide that criminal cases, not of a federal nature, cognizable before the territorial courts, shall be tried by the state courts as successors of the same, and even though the state concurs in such provision.</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>American   Ocean Insurance Company v. 356</em><em>Bales of Cotton,</em> 1 Pet. (U.S.) 511, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></span>, Chief Justice Marshall, for the court, says:</p>\n<p>\"On the 2d day of February, 1819, Spain ceded Florida to the United States. The sixth article of the treaty of cession contains the following provision: 'The inhabitants of the territories, which his Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States by this treaty, shall be incorporated into the Union of the United States <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 394</span> \nas soon as may be consistent with the principles of the federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of the privileges, rights and immunities of the citizens of the United States.' This treaty is the law of the land, and admits the inhabitants of Florida to the enjoyments of the privileges, rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States. It is unnecessary to inquire whether this is not their condition independent of stipulation. They do not, however, participate in the political power; they do not share in the government till Florida shall become a state. In the meantime Florida continues to be a territory of the United States; governed by virtue of that clause in the Constitution which empowers Congress 'to make all needful rules and regulations, respecting the territory, or other property belonging to the United States.' Perhaps the power of governing a territory belonging to the United States, which has not by becoming a state, acquired the means of self-government, may result necessarily from the facts that it is not within the jurisdiction of any particular state, and is within the power and jurisdiction of the United States. The right to govern may be the inevitable consequence of the right to acquire territory. Whichever may be the source whence the power is derived, the possession of it is unquestioned. * * *</p>\n<p>\"It has already been stated that all the laws which were in force in Florida while a province of Spain, those excepted which were political in their character, which concerned the relations between the people and their sovereign, remained in force until altered by the government of the United States. Congress recognizes this principle by using these words, 'laws of the territories now in force therein.' No laws could have been in force but those enacted by the Spanish government. If, among these, a law existed on salvage  &#8212; and it is scarcely possible there should not have been such a law  &#8212; jurisdiction over cases arising under it was conferred on the superior courts; but that jurisdiction was not exclusive. A territorial act, conferring jurisdiction over the same cases on an inferior court, would not have been inconsistent with this section. * * *</p>\n<p>\"If we have recourse to that pure fountain from which all the jurisdiction of the federal courts is derived, we find language employed which cannot well be misunderstood. The Constitution declares (article 3), that 'the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be under <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 395</span> \ntheir authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, or other public ministers, and consuls, and to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,' * * *</p>\n<p>\"It has been contended that by the Constitution the judicial power of the United States extends to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and that the whole of this judicial power must be vested 'in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.' Hence it has been argued that Congress cannot vest admiralty jurisdiction in courts created by the territorial Legislature. We have only to pursue this subject one step further to perceive that this provision of the Constitution does not apply to it. The next sentence declares 'that judges both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their office during good behavior.' The judges of the superior courts of Florida hold their offices for four years. These courts, then, are not constitutional courts, in which the judicial power conferred by the Constitution on the general government can be deposited. They are incapable of receiving it. They are legislative courts created in virtue of the general right of sovereignty which exists in the government, or in virtue of that clause which enables Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory belonging to the United States. The jurisdiction with which they are invested is not a part of that judicial power which is defined in the third article of the Constitution, but is conferred by Congress, in the execution of those general powers which that body possess over the territories of the United States. Although admiralty jurisdiction can be exercised in the states in those courts only which are established in pursuance of the third article of the Constitution, the same limitation does not extend to the territories. In legislating for them, Congress exercises the<em>combined powers of the general and of a state government</em>.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>McAllister v. United States,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></span></cross_reference>, 11 Sup. Ct. 949, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></span>, it is said:</p>\n<p>\"In view of these and other provisions of that act, it is clear that the District Court for Alaska was invested with the powers of a District Court and a Circuit Court of the United States, as well as with general jurisdiction to enforce in Alaska the laws of the state of Oregon, so far as they were applicable and not inconsistent with the act and the Constitution and laws of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 396</span> \nUnited States. But is the court thus established for Alaska one of the 'courts of the United States' within the meaning of section 1768 of the Revised Statutes? If it be, then the President had no authority, by that section, to suspend Judge McAllister, and his claim to salary, up to, at least, the confirmation by the Senate of the nomination of Dawson is well founded,. If it be not, then the judge of the Alaska court is not of the class excepted by that section, and being a civil officer, appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was within the very terms of the clause authorizing his suspension by the President during the recess of the Senate. An affirmative answer to the question just stated could not well be given upon the theory that a territorial court is one of those mentioned in article 3 of the Constitution, declaring that the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time establish, the judges of which hold their office during good behavior, receiving at stated times, for their services, a compensation that cannot be diminished during their continuance in office, and are removable only by impeachment.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Benner v.

They were incapable of receiving, as the tenure of the incumbent was for but four years. <em>American Ins. Co. v. Canter,</em> 1 Pet.

There is nothing in the Constitution which would prevent Congress conferring the jurisdiction which they exercise, if the judges were elected by the people of the territory and commissioned by the Governor. They might be clothed with the same authority to decide all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, subject to the same revision. Indeed, it hardly can be supposed that the earliest territorial courts did not decide such questions, although there was no express provision to that effect, as we have already seen, until a comparatively recent period. There is no Supreme Court of the United States, nor is there any District Court of the United States, in the sense of the Constitution, in the territory of Utah. The judges are not appointed for the same terms, nor is the jurisdiction which they exercise part of the judicial power conferred by the Constitution of the general government. The courts are the legislative courts of the territory, created in virtue of the clause which authorizes Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territories belonging to the United States.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Hornbuckle v.

They were not intended as exertions of that plenary municipal authority which Congress has over the District of Columbia and the territories of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Snow v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, which involved the question as to whether the United States attorney or the proper territorial attorney should prosecute certain cases in the territory of Utah, the court said:</p>\n<p>\"Strictly speaking, there is no sovereignty in a territory of the United States but that of the United States itself. Crimes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 398</span> \ncommitted therein are committed against the government and dignity of the United States. It would seem that the indictments and writs should regularly be in the name of the United States, and that the attorney of the United States was the proper officer to prosecute all offenses. But the practice has been otherwise, not only in Utah, but in other territories organized upon the same type.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>National Bank v. County of Yankton,</em><cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></span></cross_reference>, 168 (<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90101\"><a href=\"/opinion/90101/national-bank-v-county-of-yankton/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></a></span>), the court said:</p>\n<p>\"All territory within the jurisdiction of the United States not included in any state must necessarily be governed by or under the authority of Congress. The territories are but political subdivisions of the outlying dominion of the United States. Their relation to the general government is much the same as that which counties bear to the respective states, and Congress may legislate for them as a state does for its municipal organizations. The organic law of a territory takes the place of a Constitution as the fundamental law of the local government. It is obligatory on and binds the territorial authorities; but Congress is supreme, and for the purposes of this department of its governmental authority has all the powers of the people of the United States, except such as were expressly or by implication reserved in the prohibitions of the Constitution. In the organic act of Dakota there was not an express reservation of power in Congress to amend the acts of the territorial Legislature, nor was it necessary. Such a power is an incident of sovereignty, and continues until granted away. Congress may not only abrogate laws of the territorial Legislature, but it may itself legislate directly for the local government. It may make a void act of the territorial Legislature valid, and a valid act void. In other words, it has full and complete legislative authority over the people of the territories and all the departments of the territorial governments.\"</p>\n<p>To the same effect is the case of <em>Shively v.

Suit was thereafter instituted in the Supreme Court by the Attorney General of the United States, in accordance with the provisions of this act, to determine such question. The case was decided on March 16, 1896 (<em>United States v.

Section 2 of an act of Congress relating to Greer county (Act May 4, 1896, c. 155, 29 Stat. 114), provides:</p>\n<p>\"That all proceedings and actions of every kind, in or before the several courts and officers of Greer county, Texas, shall have the same force and effect as if said courts and officers had been legally authorized courts and officers of the United States or of the territory of Oklahoma, and the courts of said territory having jurisdiction of similar matters shall make and issue all orders and writs necessary to endorse the orders, decrees, and final judgments of said courts and officers of Texas.\"</p>\n<p>Section 3 provides:</p>\n<p>\"That all suits which are pending in the several courts of said Greer county, Texas, on March sixteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, as shown by the dockets thereof, shall be entered <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 401</span> \nupon the dockets of the courts of Oklahoma having jurisdiction of like cases, and the same shall proceed as if they had been brought in said courts of Oklahoma. Where an appeal or writ of error has been taken by any of said courts of Greer county, Texas, to any other court of Texas, the judgment of said appellate court shall be binding upon all parties to such case, and upon the filing of a certified copy thereof in the court of Oklahoma having jurisdiction of like cases, it shall be the duty of such court to enter the same upon its minutes and proceed in said action in all respects as though it had rendered the original judgment therein. All rights in the cases mentioned in this section shall be determined by the law of Texas applicable to the act or transaction involved, and the courts shall take judicial notice of such law for the purpose. When any judgment affirmed by any such appellate court provides for imprisonment, such imprisonment shall be in such place as the proper court of Oklahoma shall designate.\"</p>\n<p>It will be observed in that act Congress provided that all cases which were pending in the several courts of Greer county, Tex., should be entered upon the dockets of the courts of Oklahoma having jurisdiction of like cases, and that the same should be proceeded with as if they had been brought in said courts of Oklahoma. All criminal proceedings pending in Greer county, Tex., had been instituted by the state of Texas and were pending in the courts of that state, and in all other respects were proceedings which had been instituted under the laws of Texas. Congress transferred those cases to the territory of Oklahoma to be prosecuted by the proper county officers of Greer county, Okla., a territory of the United States. Strictly speaking, Greer county was never a part of the state of Texas, but it certainly cannot be a question that the state of Texas, with a <em>de jure</em> government, maintained a <em>de</em><em>facto</em> government in Greer county. Its courts were constituted in the manner provided by the laws of the state of Texas, and authorized by legislative enactments. The control of Texas in domestic and local affairs was supreme and undisturbed. It had every attribute, and performed every function, of a <em>de jure</em>\ngovernment. Up to the time of the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, the state of Texas, a <em>de jure</em>\ngovernment, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 402</span> \nexercised an undisturbed sovereignty and jurisdiction over Greer county, and while this power was exercised without right, it constituted a <em>de facto</em> government, executive, legislative, and judicial, and all the acts of its officers and courts, not in contravention of any rights under the laws of the Constitution of the United States, were valid and binding. The act of Congress transferred all cases instituted and pending under the laws and in the courts of one sovereignty to the courts of another sovereignty, to be there proceeded with as if they had been brought originally in the courts of the sovereignty to which they were transferred. In that case there was an exercise of sovereignty by one of the states of the Union over territory which did not belong to it, and while the governments and courts in Greer county, Tex., were merely <em>de</em><em>facto</em> and not <em>de jure,</em> at the same time could it be said that the transfer of the criminal cases which had been previously instituted and which were pending in the courts of Texas was not a transfer of cases from one sovereignty to another?</p>\n<p>The only case which has drawn in question the validity of the act of Congress was that of <em>Cullins et al. v. Overton, Sheriff,</em><em>et al.,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3800596\"><a href=\"/opinion/4043624/cullins-v-overton-sheriff/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Okla.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3800596\"><a href=\"/opinion/4043624/cullins-v-overton-sheriff/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span></cross_reference>, in which it was held that the act was in all respects within its constitutional powers.</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt as to the power of Congress to make such provisions in respect to criminal cases, although of a local character and not of a federal nature, unless the defendant is entitled by some provision of the federal Constitution to have his case prosecuted to a final determination in the United States court in that territory. As between the territory of Oklahoma and the Indian Territory there is one difference: In Oklahoma Congress had created the territorial government as an agency through which the power of Congress with respect to the prosecution of offenses of a local character was exercised. Congress, in the Indian Territory, exercised its paramount power of legislation directly instead of indirectly. There has not been a uniformity in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 403</span> \nthe government and control of the territories by the Congress of the United States. The following are examples:</p>\n<p>Arkansas: Under an act of Congress approved March 2, 1819, c. 49, 3 Stat. 493, Arkansas was organized into a territorial form of government, and section 5 of said act reads as follows:</p>\n<p>\"That the legislative power shall, until the organization of the General Assembly hereinafter provided for, be vested in the Governor and the judges of the superior courts of the territory, who shall have power to pass any law for the administration of justice in said territory which shall not be repugnant to this act or inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States: Provided, whenever the general assembly shall be organized all the legislative powers shall be vested in and exercised by said General Assembly.\"</p>\n<p>California: The state of California was brought within the limits of the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, concluded February 22, 1848, and proclaimed July 4, 1848. It was governed by the commanding officer of the military force stationed there acting as provisional governor. There was never any organized form of territorial government. General Riley, U.S. A., the provisional governor, without any action on the part of Congress, called a convention which framed a Constitution and submitted the same to the people for ratification, and on November 13, 1849, same was ratified, and afterwards, to wit, on September 9, 1850, Congress passed an act for the admission of California into the Union. On September 28, 1850, a subsequent act of Congress provides that all laws of the United States, which were not locally inapplicable, should have the same force and effect within the state of California as elsewhere in the United States.</p>\n<p>Florida: An act of Congress, approved March 30, 1822, c. 13, 3 Stat. 654 organized Florida into a territorial form of government. Section 5 of said act provides that the legislative power shall be vested in a governor and in thirteen of the most fit and discreet persons of the territory, to be called the \"Legislative Council,\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 404</span> \nwho shall be appointed annually by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, from among the citizens of the United States residing there. The Governor, by and with the advice and consent of said Legislative Council, or a majority of them, shall have power to alter, modify, or repeal the laws which may be in force at the commencement of this act. Their legislative powers shall also extend to all rightful subjects of legislation, but no law shall be valid which is inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or which shall lay any person under restraint, burthen or disability on account of his religious principles, all of which he shall be free to maintain not burdened with those of another.</p>\n<p>Louisiana: On March 3, 1805, Congress passed an act organizing Louisiana into a territorial form of government (chapter 31, 2 Stat. 331). Section 3 of said act provides that the legislative power shall be vested in a Governor and in three judges, or a majority of them, who shall have power to establish inferior courts in the said territory and prescribe their jurisdiction, and to make all laws which they may deem conducive to the good government of the inhabitants thereof: Provided, however, that no law shall be valid which is inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or which shall lay any person under restraint or disability on account of his religious opinions, profession, or worship, in all of which he shall be free to maintain his own and not be burdened with those of another: And provided also, that in all criminal prosecutions the trial shall be by a jury of twelve good and lawful men, and in all civil cases of the value of $100, the trial shall be by jury if either of the parties require it.</p>\n<p>Missouri: By act of Congress of June 4, 1812, c. 95, 2 Stat. 743, Missouri was organized into a territorial government, and section 4 of said act provides that the legislative power should be vested in a General Assembly, which should consist of the Governor, the Legislative Council, the House of Representatives; and section 5 further provides that the Legislative Council should consist <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 405</span> \nof nine members, to continue in office five years, unless sooner removed by the President of the United States, and five of them should be a quorum. The Legislative Council should be nominated and appointed in the manner following: As soon as representatives should be elected they should be confirmed by the Governor, and when said Legislative Assembly meets they should nominate 18 persons, residents in said territory, one year preceding their nomination, holding no office of profit under the territory or of the United States, the office of justice of the peace excepted, and each possessing in his own right 200 acres of land therein, and return the names to the President of the United States, nine of whom the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, should appoint and commission to serve as aforesaid, and when a vacancy should occur in the Legislative Council by death or removal from office, the House of Representatives should nominate two persons qualified as aforesaid, and return their names to the President of the United States, one of whom he should, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint and commission for the residue of the term, and every five years thereafter in like manner the President should appoint the successors or members of said council.</p>\n<p>In the Constitutions of the states under which said territories were admitted into the Union were contained provisions for the continuance of all prosecutions. Unless it was so clear and evident as to reach a moral certainty that Congress did not have the power expressly or by reasonable implication, after a century of acquiescence in same, when new states were admitted into the Union, to provide for the state to assume jurisdiction of cases of a local nature arising under the territorial government, this court will not at this late date declare such provisions to be void. But what provision in the federal Constitution gives the defendant the right to demand to be tried in a federal tribunal for an offense committed under the territorial form of government, after it has ceased to exist? We have been cited to none. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 406</span> </p>\n<p>The sixth amendment to the federal Constitution is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the<em>state</em> and <em>district</em> wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have <em>previously been ascertained</em> by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.\"</p>\n<p>The only clause in this provision which might be made the subject of argument on the constitutional question is the clause, \"which district shall * * * have been previously ascertained by law,\" and under the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States this provision would not be applicable in a case such as we have under consideration. The Supreme Court has held repeatedly that the sixth amendment applies only to the case of offenses against the laws of the United States committed within the limits of a state, and does not apply to those offenses committed within one of the territories of the United States.</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>United States v. Dawson,</em> 15 How. (U.S.) 467, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"86846\"><a href=\"/opinion/86846/united-states-v-dawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span>, an indictment had been returned in the Circuit Court of the United States for the district of Arkansas, charging murder in the Indian Territory west of the state of Arkansas. A motion was made on behalf of the defendant to quash the indictment, and one of the points urged by the counsel for the defendant was the jurisdiction of the court in which the case was being tried. The judges being divided in opinion concerning certain questions of law, the case came before the Supreme Court of the United States upon a certificate of division. Mr. Justice Nelson, in delivering the opinion of the court, in referring to the sixth amendment to the Constitution, said:</p>\n<p>\"It has been supposed that a provision in the sixth amendment to the Constitution of the United States has a bearing upon this question, which provides that 'in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right of a speedy and public trial, by an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 407</span> \nimpartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.' The argument is that, since the erection of the new district out of the nine western counties in the state, together with the Indian country, it is not competent for the circuit court, in view of this amendment, to try the prisoners within the remaining portion of the old district, inasmuch as that amendment requires the district within which the offense is committed and the trial is to be had must be ascertained and fixed previous to the commission of the offense.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Jones v. United States,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92871\"><a href=\"/opinion/92871/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span></cross_reference>, 11 Sup.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span>, which was an indictment for murder, the Supreme Court, in referring to the sixth amendment, said:</p>\n<p>\"By the Constitution of the United States, while a crime committed within any state must be tried in that state and in a district previously ascertained by law, yet a crime not committed within any state of the Union may be tried at such place as Congress may by law have directed.\"</p>\n<p>And in the case of <em>Cook v. United States,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92942\"><a href=\"/opinion/92942/cook-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">157</span></a></span></cross_reference>, 11 Sup.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span>, the Supreme Court, in considering this provision of the Constitution, held to the same effect.</p>\n<p>It will be observed by the above cases that the sixth amendment does not apply in any case where a proceeding is instituted outside of the jurisdiction of a state for a violation of the laws of the United States. The question is settled by abundant authorities. The power of Congress to designate the place of trial of criminal cases, regardless of the sixth amendment, outside of the jurisdiction of a state, cannot be successfully attacked.</p>\n<p>Oklahoma: Section 14, Enabling Act:</p>\n<p>\"That all prosecutions for crimes or offenses hereafter committed in either of said judicial districts as hereby constituted shall be cognizable with the district in which committed, and all prosecutions for crimes and offenses committed before the passage of this act in which indictments have not yet been found or proceedings instituted shall be cognizable within the judicial district as hereby constituted in which such crimes or offenses were committed.\" (Act June 16, 1906, c. 3335, 34 Stat. 275.) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 408</span> </p>\n<p>In the argument of this case there were quite a contrariety of constructions suggested as to this section, but in view of the sixth amendment to the Constitution, as construed by the Supreme Court of the United States, the intention of Congress was quite evident. Congress provided for the erection of a state out of Oklahoma and Indian Territories, and created two judicial districts, and in providing that crimes that were committed after statehood, of a federal nature, should be cognizable within a previously ascertained district in which the crime was committed, at the same time provided that such cases of a federal nature committed prior to statehood should in like manner be tried.</p>\n<p>In the United States courts of an unorganized territory &#8212; all being legislative courts created by the same powers  &#8212; crimes of a local character are practically the same as those committed in an organized territory; for as appears in <em>Snow v.</em><em>U.S., supra,</em> with strict propriety, such crimes are against the peace and dignity of the United States, although the indictment alleges \"against the peace and dignity of the people of the territory.\" If such a case can be prosecuted in a state court as successor of such court under the organized territory, why not in like manner as successor of a court of like character under the government of the unorganized territory? The alleged distinction is certainly of no moment when we are considering the constitutional power of Congress in admitting a new state to provide for proper succession of courts, and as to actions and prosecutions, so as to prevent any interval or hiatus between the old and new systems.</p>\n<p>Further, when a territorial government is created, and courts are established by means of legislation through acts of Congress, the United States Congress does not relinquish dominion or sovereignty over such territory, so far as the prosecutions of crimes of a local nature or character are concerned, but an agency is thereby created through which its powers may be exercised. If all crimes committed within a territory are committed against the government and peace and dignity of the United States, as has been said in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 409</span> \ncase of <em>Snow v. United States,</em> 18 Wall. (U.S.) 319, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88811\"><a href=\"/opinion/88811/snow-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, supra, what material difference is there, so far as the constitutional power of Congress is concerned, with respect to the transfer of pending cases, whether they are pending in the territorial courts of an organized territory or in the United States courts of an unorganized territory?</p>\n<p>Section 16 of the enabling act, as amended March 4, 1907 (chapter 2911, pt. 1, 34 Stat. 1286), so far as it relates to district court cases, is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Prosecutions for all crimes and offenses committed within the territory of Oklahoma or in the Indian Territory, pending in the district courts of the territory of Oklahoma or in the United States courts in the Indian Territory upon the admission of such territories as a state, which, had they been<em>committed within a state, would have been cognizable in the</em><em>federal courts,</em> shall be transferred to and be proceeded with in the United States Circuit or District Court established by this act for the district in which the offenses were committed, in the same manner and with the same effect as if they had been committed within a state.\"</p>\n<p>The test is to be made by applying the hypothetical existence of a state to a region that was specifically a territory and subject to special laws as such.</p>\n<p>Section 39 of the enabling act under which Oklahoma was admitted, but relating solely to Arizona and New Mexico, is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"That in respect to all cases, proceedings, and matters now pending in the supreme court or district courts of the said territories at the time of the admission into the Union of the said state, and arising within the limits of such state, whereof the circuit or district courts by this act established might have had jurisdiction under the laws of the United States had such courts existed at the time of the commencement of such cases, the said circuit and district courts, respectively, shall be the successors of said supreme and district courts of the said territories respectively; and in respect to all cases, proceedings, and matters pending in the supreme or district courts of the said territories at the time of the admission of such territories into the Union, arising within the limits of said state, the courts established by such state shall, respectively, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 410</span> \nbe the successors of said supreme and district territorial courts; and all the files, records, indictments and proceedings relating to any such cases shall be transferred to such circuit, district, and state courts, respectively, and the same shall be proceeded with therein in due course of law; but no writ, action, indictment, cause, or proceeding now pending, or that prior to the admission of the state shall be pending, in any territorial court in said territories shall abate by the admission of such state into the Union, but the same shall be transferred and proceeded with in the proper United States circuit, district, or state court, as the case may be: Provided, however, that in all civil actions, causes and proceedings, in which the United States is not a party transfers shall not be made to the Circuit and District Courts of the United States except on cause shown by written request of one of the parties to such action or proceeding filed in the proper court; and in the absence of such request such cases shall be proceeded with in the proper state courts.\" (Act June 16, 1906, c. 3335, 34 Stat. 284.)</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Moore v. United States,</em> 85 Fed. 470, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cow.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. A. 274, the court says:</p>\n<p>\"There are some acts which Congress may by law designate as a crime against the general government or against the operations of government which affect every citizen, whether of a state or territory; such as treason, illegally holding office, violations of the postal laws, false impersonation in procuring naturalization, presenting false claims against the government, etc. The federal laws defining these and kindred offenses operate upon all citizens of the United States, and that they reside in a state constitutes no exemption from a prosecution for a violation thereof in the courts of the United States, for jurisdiction is expressly conferred by statute upon the federal courts. As applied to criminal laws, it is the laws of the United States that the enabling act declares shall have the same force and effect within the state of Utah as elsewhere within the United States; and it is prosecutions for violations thereof which, under the provisions of that act, are not to abate upon the admission of the state by reason of any change in the courts, but are to be transferred from the territorial district court, a court having jurisdiction in such cases during the existence of a territorial form of government, to the circuit and district courts, courts having jurisdiction in such cases after admission of the state. That <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 411</span> \nthe provisions of the enabling act were so understood and construed by the constitutional convention is evidenced by the fact that in the schedule (annexed to the Constitution) providing for the transfer of causes to the federal courts it provides only for those cases whereof the United States Circuit Court and District Courts might have had jurisdiction had there been a state government at the time of the commencement thereof, and this is not such a case.\"</p>\n<p>Apparently it was the intention of the Congress in using the language in section 16 of the enabling act, as amended, in reference to pending cases in Oklahoma and Indian Territory, different to that in section 39 of the same act relating to such cases in New Mexico and Arizona, two organized territories, to recognize the existing conditions of an organized and unorganized territory being admitted as one state into the Union. And obviously the Congress intended to vest in the federal courts the continued prosecution of criminal cases of a federal character, and to continue in the state courts the prosecutions of a local or municipal character.</p>\n<p>Applying this test to a county embraced within the former Indian Territory, which had never been erected into an organized territory with a legislative assembly, but where all the governmental legislation therefor was directly enacted by the Congress, it was not intended that pending criminal cases should be transferred to the federal courts merely because they all involved an offense under an act of Congress. For the last clause of section 20, as amended, is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"All criminal cases pending in the United States courts in the Indian Territory, not transferred to the United States Circuit or District Courts in the state of Oklahoma, shall be prosecuted to final determination in the state courts of Oklahoma under the laws now in force in that territory.\"</p>\n<p>The distinction reasonably appears to be the same as that recognized in reference to organized territories, in which the territorial courts sitting as United States courts have cognizance of laws of the United States, and, as territorial courts laws of the territory or of a local nature. <em>Ex parte</em><em>Gen-shav-ee,</em> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 412</span> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92480\"><a href=\"/opinion/92480/gon-shay-ee/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span></cross_reference>, 9 Sup.

Further, however, prosecutions under any federal statute, which were not contingent on the fact that the country was formerly a territory, but established a general law relating to crime against the United States of which a federal court would have had jurisdiction even had the crime been committed within a state, and not within a territory, are to be transferred to the federal courts.</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Koenigsberger v.

Ct. 751, 39 L.Ed., 889, which was an action at law commenced in the district court of the First judicial district of the territory of Dakota, the Supreme Court of the United States, in passing upon the question of the admission of a territory as a state and the disposition of pending cases, said:</p>\n<p>\"So long as a territory of the United States remains in the territorial condition, and the United States have entire dominion and sovereignty over it, national and municipal, there is ordinarily no occasion to distinguish how far the subjects committed by Congress to the courts of the territory are not of a federal character. <em>American Inc.

But when a territory is admitted into the Union as a state, upon the same footing as all the other states, the territorial government and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 413</span> \ncourts cease to exist, and matters of national cognizance remain within the power and jurisdiction of the nation, but other matters come under the power and jurisdiction of the state; and then it becomes important to distinguish, as to pending suits, whether they are of a federal or of a municipal character, and to provide by law that those of the first class should proceed in the courts of the United States and those of the second class in the courts of the new state. The courts of the United States inferior to this court having no jurisdiction except as conferred by Congress, congressional legislation is necessary to enable those courts, after the admission of the state into the Union, to take jurisdiction of cases previously commenced in the courts of the territory, and not yet finally adjudged. And such legislation has been so construed and expounded by this court as to give effect as far as possible, consistently with its terms and with the Constitution of the United States, to the apparent intention of Congress to vest in the courts of the United States the jurisdiction of such cases, so far as they are of a federal character, either because of their arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, or because of their being between citizens of different states. <em>Freeborn v.

While it is not entirely clear that under this statute it was intended to extend these laws to all parts of the territory as distinct from those places of exclusive federal jurisdiction, such as military or Indian reservations, to which they would have extended even within a state, it would in any event appear that, in so far as the jurisdiction of the federal court depended solely on the fact that the offense was committed within the territory, it would not have been cognizable in a federal court if committed within a state or if this particular territory had been a state when the offense was committed, but would be an offense coming within a local law for the government of the territories, the prosecution of which should be continued in the state courts after the admission of such territories as a state. I am, therefore, inclined to the view, expressed in Judge Campbell's opinion in the Thompson Case, that jurisdiction did not pass to the federal court, if, as appears in your letter, the indictment was based solely upon section 5339 of the Revised Statutes [U.S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3627].\"</p>\n<p>We conclude that Congress intended, in providing for the transferring of cases pending in the territorial courts of Oklahoma and the United States courts of the Indian Territory at the time of the admission of the state into the Union, that each should be considered as if a state government existed at the time of the commission of the alleged offenses, and if in that condition it would have been cognizable in the federal courts, then the same should be transferred to such courts, otherwise to be prosecuted to a final determination in the state courts. <em>United States v.

The courts of the United States have therefore no jurisdiction to punish crimes within that reservation, unless so far as may be necessary to carry out such provisions of the treaty with the Ute Indians as remain in force. But that treaty contains no stipulation for the punishment of offenses committed by white men against white men.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, the court says:</p>\n<p>\"The assertion of jurisdiction in the courts of the United States over the crime of murder perpetrated by one not an Indian against one not an Indian is based on the fact that the offense was committed on an Indian reservation. The contention as to want of jurisdiction rests upon the proposition that, the Indian reservation being within the state, the courts of the state had alone cognizance of crimes therein done by others than Indians. To determine these conflicting contentions requires a brief examination of the legislation organizing the territory of Montana and which provided for the admission of the state into the Union.</p>\n<p>\"The territory of Montana was organized by the act of May 26, 1864, c. 95, 13 Stat. 85. Subsequently, in 1868, the Crow Indian Reservation was created (15 Stat. 649), the land of which it was composed being wholly situated within the geographical boundaries of the territory of Montana. The treaty creating this reservation contained no stipulation restricting the power of the United States to include the land embraced within the reservation, in any state or territory then existing or which might thereafter be created. The law to enable Montana and other states to be admitted into the Union was passed February 22, 1889, 25 Stat. 676, c. 180. This act embraced the usual provisions for a convention to frame a Constitution, for the adoption of an ordinance directed to contain specified agreements, and provided that, upon the compliance with the ordained requirements, and the proclamation of the President so announcing, the state should be admitted on an equal footing with the original states. The question then is, has the state of Montana jurisdiction over offenses committed within its geographical boundaries by persons not Indian or against Indians, or did the enabling act deprive the courts of the state of such jurisdiction of all offenses committed on the Crow Indian Reservation, thereby divesting the state <em>pro tanto</em>\nof equal authority and jurisdiction over its citizens, usually enjoyed by the other states of the Union?</p>\n<p>\"<em>United States v. McBratney</em> is therefore decisive of the question now before us, unless the enabling act of the state of Montana contained provisions taking that state out of the general rule and depriving its courts of the jurisdiction to them belonging and resulting from the very nature of the equality conferred on the state by virtue of its admission into the Union. Such exception is sought here to be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 421</span> \nevolved from certain provisions of the enabling act of Montana which were ratified by an ordinance of the convention which framed the Constitution of the State. The provision relied on is as follows:</p>\n<p>\" 'Second. That the people inhabiting the said proposed state of Montana do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within the boundaries thereof, and to all lands lying within said limits owned or held by any Indian or Indian tribes, and that until the title thereto shall have been extinguished by the United States the same shall be and remain subject to the disposition of the United States, and said Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States; that the lands belonging to citizens of the United States residing without the said state of Montana shall never be taxed at a higher rate than the lands belonging to residents thereof; that no taxes shall be imposed by the said state of Montana on lands or property therein belonging to or which may hereafter be purchased by the United States or reserved for its use. But nothing herein or in the ordinances herein provided for shall preclude the said state of Montana from taxing as other lands are taxed any land owned or held by an Indian who has severed his tribal relations and has obtained from the United States, or from any person, a title thereto by patent or other grant, save and except such lands as have been or may be granted to any Indian or Indians under any act of Congress containing a provision exempting the lands thus granted from taxation, but said last-named lands shall be exempt from taxation by said state of Montana so long and to such extent as such act of Congress may prescribe.'</p>\n<p>\"The words in the foregoing provisions upon which the argument is based are the following: 'And said Indian lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the Congress of the United States.' This language has been considered in several cases in the courts of the United States with somewhat contradictory results. <em>United States v. Ewing</em>\n(D.C.) 47 Fed. 809; <em>United States v. Partello</em> (C. C.) 48 Fed. 670; <em>Truscott v. Hurlbut Land   Cattle Co.,</em> 73 Fed. 60, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cow.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. A. 374.</p>\n<p>\"As equality of statehood is the rule, the words relied on here to create an exception cannot be construed as doing so, if, by any reasonable meaning, they can be otherwise treated. The mere reservation of jurisdiction and control by the United States of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 422</span> \n'Indian lands' does not of necessity signify a retention of jurisdiction in the United States to punish all offenses committed on such lands by others than Indians or against Indians. It is argued that as the first portion of the section in which the language relied on is found disclaims all right and title of the state to 'the unappropriated public lands lying within the boundaries thereof and of all lands lying within said limits, owned or held by an Indian or Indian tribes, and until the title thereof shall be extinguished by the United States, the same shall be and remain subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,' therefore the subsequent words 'and said lands shall remain under the absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States' are rendered purely tautological and meaningless, unless they signify something more than the reservation of authority of the United States over the lands themselves and the title thereto. This argument overlooks not only the particular action of Congress as to the Crow Reservation, but also the state of the general law of the United States, as to Indian reservations, at the time of the admission of Montana into the Union.</p>\n<p>\"On April 11, 1882, c. 74, 22 Stat. 42, Congress confirmed an agreement submitted by the Crow Indians for the sale of a portion of their reservation, and for the survey and division in severalty of the agricultural lands remaining in the reservation as thus reduced. The act, however, provided that the title to be acquired by the allottees was not to be subject to alienation, lease or incumbrance, either by voluntary conveyance of the grantee or his heirs, or by the judgment, order, or decree of any court, but should remain inalienable and be not subject to taxation for the period of twenty-five years, and until such time thereafter as the President might see fit to remove the restriction.</p>\n<p>\"The policy thus applied to the Crow Reservation subsequently became the general method adopted by Congress to deal with Indian reservations. In February, 1887, by a general law, Congress provided 'for the allotment of lands in severalty to Indians on the various reservations, and to extend the protection of the laws of the United States and the territories over the Indians, and for other purposes.' Act Feb. 8, 1887, c. 119, 24 Stat. 388. The act in question contemplated the gradual extinction of Indian reservations and Indian titles by the allotment of such lands to the Indians in severalty. It provided, in section 6, 'that upon the completion of said allotments and the patenting of said lands to said allottees, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 423</span> \neach and every member of the respective bands or tribes of Indians to whom allotments have been made shall have the benefit of and subject to the laws, both civil and criminal, of the state or territory in which they may reside. But the act the same time put limitations and restrictions upon the power of the Indians to sell incumber, or deal with the lands thus to be allotted. Moreover, by section 4 of the act of 1887, Indians not residing on a reservation, or for whose tribe no reservation had been provided, were empowered to enter a designated quantity of unappropriated public land and to have patents therefor, the right, however, of such Indian to sell or incumber being regulated by provisions like those controlling allotments in severalty of lands comprised within a reservation. From these enactments it clearly follows that at the time of the admission of Montana into the Union, and the use in the enabling act of the restrictive words here relied upon, there was a condition of things provided for by the statute law of the United States, and contemplated to arise where the reservation of jurisdiction and control over the Indian lands would become essential to prevent any implication of the power of the state to frustrate the limitations imposed by the laws of the United States upon the title of lands once in an Indian reservation, but which had become extinct by allotment in severalty, and in which contingency the Indians themselves would have passed under the authority and control of the State.</p>\n<p>\"It is also equally clear that the reservation of jurisdiction and control over the Indian lands was relevant to and is explicable by the provisions of section 4 of the act of 1887, which allowed nonreservation Indians to enter on and take patents for a certain designated quantity of public land. Indeed, if the meaning of the words which reserved jurisdiction and control over Indian lands contended for by the defendant in error were true, then the state of Montana would not only be deprived of authority to punish offenses committed by her own citizens upon Indian reservations, but also would have like want of authority for all offenses committed by her own citizens upon such portion of the public domain, within her borders, as may have been appropriated and patented to an Indian under the terms of the act of 1887. The conclusion to which the contention leads is an efficient demonstration of its fallacy. It follows that a proper appreciation of the legislation as to Indians existing at the time of the passage of the enabling act by which the state of Montana was admitted into the Union adequately explains the use of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 424</span> \nthe words relied upon, and demonstrates that in reserving to the United States jurisdiction and control over Indian lands it was not intended to deprive that state of power to punish for crimes committed on a reservation or Indian lands by other than Indians or against Indians, and that a consideration of the whole subject fully answers the argument that the language used in the enabling act becomes meaningless unless it be construed as depriving the state of authority to it belonging in virtue of its existence as an equal member of the Union.\"</p>\n<p>Section 4, par. 2. of the Montana enabling act, Act. Feb. 22, 1889, c. 180, 25 Stat. 676, is substantially the same in effect as the proviso in section 1 of the Oklahoma enabling act which reads as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Provided, that nothing contained in the said Constitution shall be construed to limit or impair the rights of person or property pertaining to the Indians of said territories (so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished) or to limit or affect the authority of the government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this act bad never been passed.\"</p>\n<p>The only other reservation as to jurisdiction in the Oklahoma enabling act is contained in the proviso of section 7 to wit:</p>\n<p>\"Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall repeal or affect any act of Congress relating to the Sulphur Springs Reservation as now defined or as may be hereafter defined or extended, or the power of the United States over it or any other lands embraced in the state hereafter set aside by Congress as a national park, game preserve, or for the preservation of objects of archaeological interest; and nothing contained in this act shall interfere with the rights and ownership of the United States in any land hereafter set aside by Congress as national park, game preserve, or, other reservation, or in the said Sulphur Springs Reservation, as it now is or may be hereafter defined or extended by law; but exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, shall be exercised by the United States, which shall have exclusive control and jurisdiction over the same; but nothing in this proviso, contained shall be construed to prevent the service within said Sulphur Springs Reservation or national parks, game preserves, and other reservations <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 425</span> \nhereafter established by law, of civil and criminal processes lawfully issued by the authority of said state, and said state shall not be entitled to select indemnity school lands for thirteenth, sixteenth, thirty-third, and thirty-sixth sections that may be embraced within the metes and bounds of the national park, game preserve. and other reservation or the said Sulphur Springs Reservation, as now defined or may be hereafter defined.\"</p>\n<p>By the same process of reasoning followed by the Supreme Court of the United States in cases of <em>United States v.</em><em>McBratney, supra,</em> and <em>Draper v. United States, supra,</em> we conclude that the Congress, upon the admission of Oklahoma as a state, where it has intended to except out of such state an Indian reservation, or the sole and exclusive jurisdiction over that reservation, it has done so by express words. It is not contended that the alleged crime was committed on any such excepted reservation, or in any place where the United States has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction since the admission of the state. Now, mark you the language, \"had they been committed within a state would have been cognizable in the federal courts,\" contained in section 16, as amended March 4, 1907, of the Oklahoma enabling act. Does not that mean in a state similarly circumstanced as one with enabling act like ours? When you consider this language in connection with section 39 of the same enabling act pertaining to Arizona and New Mexico,<em>supra,</em> it seems that Congress was recognizing the existing conditions and the bringing in of an organized and unorganized territory as one state, and that it was laying down the rule that if such offense had been committed after the admission of the state it would have been cognizable in the federal court, that then such Federal court would have jurisdiction; otherwise not. Any other conclusion can be reached only by reasoning against the apparent and reasonable literal meaning. See, also, the following authorities heretofore cited: <em>Moore v.

L. Brown, judge of the Second Judicial District, and H. Stephens, sheriff. Writ granted, on condition.\n\nOn the 18th day of December, 1907, the relator instituted this action in this court, alleging that he was in the custody of the United States marshal for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. That theretofore, to wit, on the 9th day of May, 1906, he was indicted in the United States court for the Northern District of the Indian Territory, at Claremore, charged therein with having, on the 10th day of April, 1906, killed one John Hancock in such a manner as to constitute the crime of murder, and upon the return of the indictment he was committed by proper order of said court to the federal jail at Vinita in said district, and that he has ever since said time remained in said jail, and since the admission of the state into the Union he has been in the custody of the United States marshal of said district. That on the 3d day of December, 1907, he filed this petition in the United States court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, praying for his release and discharge, and that on the 4th day of said month the judge of said court issued an order directing the marshal to deliver relator over to the proper officers of said district court of the Second judicial district in and for Rogers county. Thereafter, in compliance with said order, said marshal offered to deliver said relator to the respondent Hiram Stephens, sheriff of Rogers county, and that as such sheriff he refused and declined, and still refuses and declines, to receive relator into his custody. Further, that said T. L. Brown, as judge of the said court, refused to receive and entertain jurisdiction in said cause against the relator, and refused to permit the same to be filed and docketed and become a part of the records of said court. Relator further says that by reason of the refusal of said respondent Hiram Stephens, as sheriff, to receive him into custody, and by reason of said respondent T. L. Brown, judge of said district, refusing to entertain jurisdiction of said cause, this relator is unable to have his cause set for trial, and unable to have bond fixed for his appearance in said court, and that he has no adequate remedy at law to have his rights determined in the premises. Wherefore he prays for a peremptory writ of mandamus to issue from this court, directed\nto the said respondents, requiring them to take proper action in the premises.\n\nThe respondents and the relator, by written stipulation filed in this court on the same date of said petition, agreed that said relator is confined in the United States jail at Vinita in the custody of the United States marshal for said district, by virtue of an indictment regularly returned to the United States court for the Northern District of the Indian Territory, at Claremore, on the 9th day of May, 1906, charging relator with the crime of murder. Further, that at the time of the admission of said state into the Union the cause was pending in the United States court for the Northern District of the Indian Territory at Claremore, now the county seat of Rogers county, Okla. That on the 4th day of December, 1907, relator secured an order from the judge of the United States court for the Eastern District, directing the United States marshal for said district to deliver relator to the proper officers of the district court of the Second judicial district of said state for Rogers county. In compliance with said order said relator was tendered to said respondent sheriff, and said sheriff refused to accept said relator on the grounds that the district court of said district had no jurisdiction over said relator, and therefore he was not a proper person to be received into custody by the said officers. That the said T. L. Brown, judge of the said district, refused to entertain jurisdiction of the said relator, and still refuses to, on the ground that said district court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine said cause or make any order therein. That the relator is now in the United States jail at Vinita in the Eastern District of Oklahoma, awaiting action on the part of the sheriff to receive said relator into custody, and that the said relator cannot obtain a hearing on said cause on an application for bail or fix the date of hearing of said cause against him.", "federal_cite_one": "", "case_name_short": "Higgins", "date_filed": "1908-03-09", "federal_cite_two": "", "docket": {"court": {"has_opinion_scraper": true, "in_use": true, "url": "http://www.oscn.net/oscn/schome/start.htm", "start_date": "1884-01-01", "full_name": "Supreme Court of Oklahoma", "date_modified": "2016-09-08T20:40:27.897688Z", "position": 366.999, "jurisdiction": "S", "has_oral_argument_scraper": false, "resource_uri": "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/courts/okla/", "citation_string": "Okla.", "short_name": "Supreme Court of Oklahoma", "end_date": null}, "date_blocked": null, "filepath_ia": "", "docket_number": "No. 23", "date_argued": null, "date_reargued": null, "cause": "", "case_name_short": "Higgins", "date_filed": null, "filepath_local": null, "date_cert_denied": null, "source": 4, "assigned_to": null, "clusters": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/4074030/"], "jurisdiction_type": "", "audio_files": [], "date_reargument_denied": null, "date_terminated": null, "case_name_full": "Higgins v.
