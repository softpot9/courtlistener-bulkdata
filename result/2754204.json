The Montgomery County Detective Bureau gathered\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n     See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6105(a)(1), and 901 (35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(12));\nand 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), respectively.\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\ninformation about Tuggle through confidential informants, reports from other\n\npolice departments, surveillance, and controlled purchases of controlled\n\nsubstances. Based upon the probable cause established by this information,\n\npolice applied for and received a search warrant for Tuggle\u2019s residence on\n\nAugust 18, 2011. Upon the execution of that warrant and the recovery of\n\nevidence obtained therefrom, Tuggle was arrested and charged with, inter\n\nalia, the above-referenced crimes. Prior to his trial, Tuggle filed a motion to\n\nsuppress a statement that he provided after his arrest, and the trial court\n\nheld a hearing on Tuggle\u2019s motion on July 15, 2013.\n\n      The trial court has summarized the relevant facts and detailed the\n\ntestimony provided at Tuggle\u2019s suppression hearing as follows:\n\n      During the course of [Tuggle\u2019s] suppression hearing, Detective\n      [James] Vinter testified that, on August 19, 2011, at\n      approximately 6:20 a.m., he participated in the execution of a\n      search warrant at [Tuggle\u2019s] apartment on Corson Street in\n      Norristown, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Various items\n      were discovered during this search, including:       Percocet,\n      marijuana, blank prescription pads, and a handgun. [Tuggle]\n      was immediately taken into custody and was transported to the\n      headquarters of the Montgomery County Detectives, arriving\n      there at approximately 8:30 a.m., and was taken to a \u201cholding\n      facility\u201d within the building.\n\n      Detective Vinter testified that, at some point\u2014either at the\n      Corson Street apartment or in the holding facility\u2014he engaged\n      [Tuggle] in a very brief conversation, during the course of which\n      he asked [Tuggle] if he wanted to cooperate and give a\n      statement. The detective testified that [Tuggle] replied that he\n      did want to make a statement. The detective described [Tuggle]\n      as being \u201cvery cooperative at that time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n       On cross-examination by [defense counsel], Detective Vinter\n       readily acknowledged that he had not informed [Tuggle] of his\n       rights under Miranda v. Arizona[2] prior to asking [Tuggle] if he\n       was willing to cooperate with the police. Detective Vinter further\n       acknowledged that, if the conversation had taken place in the\n       holding facility at the Montgomery County Detectives building,\n       [Tuggle] would have been handcuffed and \u201csecured\u201d at the time\n       of the conversation.\n\n       Asked by [defense counsel] if his conversation with [Tuggle] had\n       \u201cincluded your concern\u201d over a handgun that was discovered\n       during the search of [Tuggle\u2019s] apartment, Detective Vinter\n       testified that he could not recall having any discussion with\n       [Tuggle] concerning the handgun. The detective testified:\n\n          I don\u2019t know if I ever said anything about a handgun, Your\n          Honor. I know I didn\u2019t ask him anything about what was\n          found in his residence, other than asking him if he would\n          supply a statement and cooperate. He said he would. But\n          what was found in the house I never asked him.\n\n       As the [trial court] stated on the record in denying [Tuggle\u2019s]\n       motion to suppress, [the] court fully credited Detective Vinter\u2019s\n       testimony in its entirety.\n\n       Detective [Michael] Reynolds testified that he took [Tuggle\u2019s]\n       statement in an interview room in the Montgomery County\n       Detectives building. The detective testified that, prior to taking\n       the statement, he read [Tuggle] his rights under Miranda v.\n       Arizona, and [Tuggle] then executed a written waiver of those\n       rights. The waiver on its face explicitly advised [Tuggle] that:\n       he had the right to remain silent and that anything he said could\n       and would be used against him; that he had a right to consult a\n       lawyer before being questioned and to have a lawyer present\n       during questioning; that if he could not afford a lawyer, a lawyer\n       would be provided to him without cost prior to questioning; and\n       that he had the right to refuse to answer any questions and to\n       stop talking at any time.\n\n       After [Tuggle] executed the waiver, Detective Reynolds\n       conducted an interview of [Tuggle], beginning at 11:00 a.m. and\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n       384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n     ending at 11:50 a.m. The detective testified that [Tuggle] was\n     cooperative, and that at no point did the conversation become\n     contentious or heated, and at no point did [Tuggle] ask to stop\n     the interview or ask for a lawyer.\n\n     Detective Reynolds then typed [Tuggle\u2019s] statement and gave it\n     to him to review and make any changes he wanted. A copy of\n     the typed statement was entered into evidence at [Tuggle\u2019s]\n     suppression hearing.     The statement on its face contains\n     [Tuggle\u2019s] explicit acknowledgment that no threats or promises\n     had been made to him to induce him to talk to Detective\n     Reynolds, and [Tuggle\u2019s] explicit acknowledgment that his\n     decision to provide a statement . . . was a product of his own\n     free will.\n\n     As the [trial court] stated on the record, [the] court fully credited\n     the testimony of Detective Reynolds in its entirety.\n\n     [Tuggle] testified on his own behalf at the suppression hearing.\n     [Tuggle\u2019s] testimony did not contradict, in any material way, the\n     testimony of Detective Reynolds. [Tuggle\u2019s] testimony was,\n     however, at odds with that of Detective Vinter in regard to the\n     conversation between the two men during which [Tuggle] agreed\n     to provide a statement to the police.\n\n     In contrast to Detective Vinter, [Tuggle] testified:\n\n        That conversation was mainly about the firearm that was\n        recovered in the apartment, more or less. Questioning me\n        about was anything on it, which would refer to like it being\n        a dirty gun or I guess a body or so being on it.\n\n     [Tuggle] further testified:\n\n        I was telling him that I\u2019m not sure if anything\u2019s on it. I\n        was telling him it\u2019s not my firearm. But I was just mostly\n        like a little timid because he was like more persistent with\n        trying to like more or less put it on me or so, or what I\n        would say would be to try to scare me.\n\n     [Tuggle] stated:\n\n        I felt intimidated because I wasn\u2019t sure. I had no idea if\n        anything would come up on the firearm.         So I was\n        intimidated. I was kind of scared.\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n      [Tuggle] testified that he was concerned that the handgun\u2014\n      which he denied owning\u2014might have been used in a crime that\n      the police would try to \u201cpin it on me\u201d because the gun was\n      discovered during a search of his residence. [Tuggle] testified\n      that this concern \u201cplayed a major role\u201d in his decision to waive\n      his Miranda rights and give a statement, testifying that he\n      thought that \u201cif I give him a statement then maybe he would\n      stop asking me about the firearm or so.\u201d\n\n      On cross-examination by the attorney for the Commonwealth,\n      [Tuggle] testified that no threats or promises were made to him\n      to induce him to make a statement, but he asserted that he\n      nonetheless felt \u201cintimidated.\u201d Asked to explain exactly what\n      Detective Vinter said that made him feel intimidated, [Tuggle]\n      testified:\n\n         He said that I better hope nothing came back on the\n         firearm. He intimidated me by saying that a lot of things\n         that\u2019s going on in Norristown as far as the unresolved\n         murders or pertaining to crimes, things of that nature, that\n         if something\u2019s on that firearm then it will reflect on me.\n         That\u2019s what was intimidating to me.\n\n      Asked directly if Detective Vinter had told him that giving a\n      statement would help him, [Tuggle] replied: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nTrial Court Opinion (\u201cT.C.O.\u201d), 3/11/2014, at 2-6 (citations to notes of\n\ntestimony omitted; some punctuation modified).\n\n      In the statement that Tuggle provided to Detective Reynolds, Tuggle\n\nadmitted to stealing blank prescription forms, to filling out these prescription\n\nforms and forging doctors\u2019 signatures, to growing marijuana plants, and to\n\nselling marijuana and Percocet.    Tuggle denied ownership of the handgun,\n\nhowever, and stated that it belonged to a woman that left it in his\n\napartment.\n\n      In his motion, Tuggle sought to suppress the statement that he\n\nprovided during the interview with Detective Reynolds.         The trial court\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\ndenied   Tuggle\u2019s   suppression   motion   because   the   court   credited   the\n\nDetectives\u2019 testimony over that provided by Tuggle and determined that\n\nTuggle\u2019s statement had been preceded by a knowing, voluntary, and\n\nintelligent waiver of his Miranda rights. T.C.O. at 8, 9. On July 16, 2013,\n\nTuggle proceeded to a nonjury trial, and he was convicted on the following\n\nday. On December 16, 2013, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing,\n\nafter which it imposed an aggregate sentence of not less than seven and one\n\nhalf years nor more than fifteen years\u2019 incarceration, to be followed by a two\n\nyear period of probation.\n\n      Tuggle filed a timely notice of appeal on January 15, 2014.             On\n\nJanuary 21, 2014, the trial court directed Tuggle to file a concise statement\n\nof errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), to be\n\nserved upon the court no later than February 11, 2014. Tuggle filed a timely\n\nconcise statement on February 7, 2014. On March 11, 2014, the trial court\n\nissued an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\n\n      Tuggle raises the following issue for our review:\n\n      Whether the trial court erred in denying [Tuggle\u2019s] Motion to\n      Suppress his statements in that such statements were not\n      preceded by a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of\n      Miranda rights as the alleged waiver was preceded by coercive\n      questioning by Detective James Vinter of [Tuggle] relating to the\n      gun found in the premises and wanting him to cooperate with\n      law enforcement authorities, which tainted the voluntariness of\n      the subsequent Miranda waiver?\n\nBrief for Tuggle at 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\n      When reviewing a trial court\u2019s order denying a suppression motion, our\n\nstandard of review is well-settled:\n\n      In reviewing a suppression ruling, we are bound by the\n      suppression court\u2019s factual findings, unless they are without\n      support in the record. We may reverse the legal conclusions\n      reached by the suppression court, however, if they are in error.\n      Thus, our standard of review of the legal conclusions reached by\n      the suppression court is de novo. Where, as here, the defendant\n      is appealing the ruling of the suppression court, we consider only\n      the evidence of the prosecution, and so much of the evidence for\n      the defense which remains uncontradicted when fairly read in\n      the context of the [suppression] record.\n\nCommonwealth v. Galvin, 985 A.2d 783, 795 (Pa. 2009) (citations\n\nomitted). Additionally, \u201c[i]t is within the suppression court\u2019s sole province as\n\nfact finder to pass on the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given\n\ntheir testimony.\u201d   Commonwealth v. Clemens, 66 A.3d 373, 378 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2013) (citation omitted). With regard to our scope of review in the\n\ncontext of an order denying a suppression motion, we are limited to\n\nreviewing only the evidence that was presented at the suppression hearing,\n\nand may not consider testimony adduced at trial. See In re L.J., 79 A.3d\n\n1073, 1083\u201387 (Pa. 2013).\n\n      Tuggle argues that, although he executed a waiver of his Miranda\n\nrights prior to the interview with Detective Reynolds, his waiver was not\n\nknowing, voluntary, and intelligent because it was influenced by Detective\n\nVinter\u2019s allegedly coercive questioning.     Specifically, Tuggle asserts that\n\nDetective Vinter questioned him about the firearm that was discovered in his\n\napartment, and that the detective intimidated him by implying that Tuggle\n\n                                      -7-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\nmay be implicated in any crimes in which the firearm was previously used.\n\nBrief for Tuggle at 22.        Detective Vinter contradicted Tuggle\u2019s testimony,\n\nasserting that he only asked Tuggle if he was willing to cooperate and\n\nprovide a statement, and that he did not question Tuggle about anything\n\nthat was found in the apartment. On review of a ruling denying suppression,\n\nwe consider only the evidence of the prosecution, and so much of the\n\nevidence for the defense which remains uncontradicted when fairly read in\n\nthe context of the entire record.         Galvin, 985 A.2d at 795.         As Tuggle\u2019s\n\ntestimony was contradicted at the suppression hearing, we may not consider\n\nit on appellate review.\n\n      The trial court fully credited Detective Vinter\u2019s testimony, and found\n\nTuggle\u2019s testimony to be incredible and unpersuasive. T.C.O. at 8. \u201cAs we\n\nbelieve   that   credibility    at   a   suppression   hearing   is   an    important\n\ndetermination best resolved through the court\u2019s personal observations, we\n\nwill not reverse a suppression court\u2019s assessment of credibility absent clear\n\nand manifest error.\u201d Commonwealth v. Camacho, 625 A.2d 1242, 1245\n\n(Pa. Super. 1993). The record provides us no reason to believe that the trial\n\ncourt committed a clear and manifest error in making its credibility\n\ndeterminations.     Thus, even if we are to consider Tuggle\u2019s testimony\n\nconcerning his interaction with Detective Vinter, we are bound by the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s credibility determinations.\n\n      While our standard of review is highly deferential with respect to the\n\nsuppression court\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations, we afford\n\n                                          -8-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\nno deference to the suppression court\u2019s legal conclusions, and review such\n\nconclusions de novo. In re L.J., 79 A.3d at 1080 n.6. With regard to the\n\nvalidity of a waiver of Miranda rights, our Supreme Court has described the\n\nlaw of our Commonwealth as follows:\n\n     In determining whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of his Miranda\n     rights is valid, a trial court must consider: (1) whether the\n     waiver was voluntary, in the sense that the waiver was not the\n     result of governmental pressure; and (2) whether the waiver\n     was knowing and intelligent, in the sense that it was made with\n     full comprehension of both the nature of the right being\n     abandoned and the consequence of that choice.                The\n     Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing that a\n     defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.\n     Factors to be considered in determining whether a waiver is valid\n     and a confession is voluntary include: the duration and means of\n     interrogation; the defendant\u2019s physical and psychological state;\n     the conditions attendant to the detention; the attitude exhibited\n     by the police during the interrogation; and any other facts which\n     may serve to drain one\u2019s powers of resistance to suggestion and\n     coercion.\n\nCommonwealth v. Patterson, 91 A.3d 55, 76 (Pa. 2014) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n     Tuggle was apprised fully of his Miranda rights before his interview\n\nwith Detective Reynolds, and he signed a waiver form, which indicated that\n\nhe was aware of his rights and was willing to give a voluntary statement.\n\nTuggle does not allege that Detective Reynolds coerced him, but rather that\n\nhis prior interaction with Detective Vinter \u201cintimidated\u201d him.     Notes of\n\nTestimony, Suppression Hearing, (\u201cN.T.\u201d), 7/15/2013, at 66.       As to the\n\nduration of this alleged interaction with Detective Vinter, Tuggle testified\n\nthat it was approximately five minutes. Id. at 65. Tuggle testified that he\n\n                                   -9-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\nwas interviewed in a room that the detectives called a \u201cholding room.\u201d Id.\n\nat 59.     While the record does not provide a detailed description of the\n\n\u201cholding room,\u201d Tuggle did not testify that the room itself was particularly\n\nintimidating or oppressive.\n\n      Tuggle     noted   that     he    had   been      consuming     marijuana     from\n\napproximately 2:30 a.m. until 5:00 a.m. on the morning of his arrest. N.T.\n\nat 67. The interview with Detective Reynolds during which Tuggle executed\n\nthe waiver of his Miranda rights began at 11:00 a.m., approximately six\n\nhours after he had stopped smoking marijuana. While the fact that Tuggle\n\nhad consumed marijuana prior to executing the waiver is relevant to\n\nTuggle\u2019s physical and psychological state, Tuggle testified that, at the time\n\nthat he gave the statement to Detective Reynolds, he was not impaired to a\n\ndegree that would prevent him from giving a statement. Id. at 69.\n\n      The most pertinent factor to be considered in determining whether\n\nTuggle\u2019s waiver is valid is the attitude exhibited by the police during the\n\ninterrogation, because Tuggle\u2019s argument is premised upon the alleged\n\nintimidation that he felt after interacting with Detective Vinter. However, as\n\nwe   discussed    above,     Tuggle\u2019s     testimony     about   the   interaction   was\n\ncontradicted by Detective Vinter\u2019s testimony.            Furthermore, the trial court\n\nappropriately    exercised      its   discretion   in   crediting   Detective   Vinter\u2019s\n\ntestimony over Tuggle\u2019s\u2014a determination that we will not disturb on appeal.\n\n      The trial court summarized the basis for its legal conclusions as\n\nfollows:\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n      Stated directly, this court heard no evidence indicating that any\n      improper coercive or intimidating tactics were employed to\n      induce the defendant to waive his Miranda rights and provide\n      his statement to Detective Reynolds. The evidence this court\n      heard rather supports the determination that the defendant\u2019s\n      waiver of Miranda rights and his statement to the detective\n      were voluntary, and a product of the defendant\u2019s own free will.\n\nN.T. at 101. We have analyzed the relevant factors, and have determined\n\nthat Tuggle\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights was voluntary, knowing, and\n\nintelligent. As such, his waiver was valid, and the trial court\u2019s conclusions of\n\nlaw were not erroneous.\n\n      Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.

Based upon the probable cause established by this information,\n\npolice applied for and received a search warrant for Tuggle\u2019s residence on\n\nAugust 18, 2011. Upon the execution of that warrant and the recovery of\n\nevidence obtained therefrom, Tuggle was arrested and charged with, inter\n\nalia, the above-referenced crimes. Prior to his trial, Tuggle filed a motion to\n\nsuppress a statement that he provided after his arrest, and the trial court\n\nheld a hearing on Tuggle\u2019s motion on July 15, 2013.\n\n      The trial court has summarized the relevant facts and detailed the\n\ntestimony provided at Tuggle\u2019s suppression hearing as follows:\n\n      During the course of [Tuggle\u2019s] suppression hearing, Detective\n      [James] Vinter testified that, on August 19, 2011, at\n      approximately 6:20 a.m., he participated in the execution of a\n      search warrant at [Tuggle\u2019s] apartment on Corson Street in\n      Norristown, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Various items\n      were discovered during this search, including:       Percocet,\n      marijuana, blank prescription pads, and a handgun. [Tuggle]\n      was immediately taken into custody and was transported to the\n      headquarters of the Montgomery County Detectives, arriving\n      there at approximately 8:30 a.m., and was taken to a \u201cholding\n      facility\u201d within the building.\n\n      Detective Vinter testified that, at some point\u2014either at the\n      Corson Street apartment or in the holding facility\u2014he engaged\n      [Tuggle] in a very brief conversation, during the course of which\n      he asked [Tuggle] if he wanted to cooperate and give a\n      statement. The detective testified that [Tuggle] replied that he\n      did want to make a statement. The detective described [Tuggle]\n      as being \u201cvery cooperative at that time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n       On cross-examination by [defense counsel], Detective Vinter\n       readily acknowledged that he had not informed [Tuggle] of his\n       rights under Miranda v. Arizona[2] prior to asking [Tuggle] if he\n       was willing to cooperate with the police. Detective Vinter further\n       acknowledged that, if the conversation had taken place in the\n       holding facility at the Montgomery County Detectives building,\n       [Tuggle] would have been handcuffed and \u201csecured\u201d at the time\n       of the conversation.\n\n       Asked by [defense counsel] if his conversation with [Tuggle] had\n       \u201cincluded your concern\u201d over a handgun that was discovered\n       during the search of [Tuggle\u2019s] apartment, Detective Vinter\n       testified that he could not recall having any discussion with\n       [Tuggle] concerning the handgun. The detective testified:\n\n          I don\u2019t know if I ever said anything about a handgun, Your\n          Honor. I know I didn\u2019t ask him anything about what was\n          found in his residence, other than asking him if he would\n          supply a statement and cooperate. He said he would. But\n          what was found in the house I never asked him.\n\n       As the [trial court] stated on the record in denying [Tuggle\u2019s]\n       motion to suppress, [the] court fully credited Detective Vinter\u2019s\n       testimony in its entirety.\n\n       Detective [Michael] Reynolds testified that he took [Tuggle\u2019s]\n       statement in an interview room in the Montgomery County\n       Detectives building. The detective testified that, prior to taking\n       the statement, he read [Tuggle] his rights under Miranda v.\n       Arizona, and [Tuggle] then executed a written waiver of those\n       rights. The waiver on its face explicitly advised [Tuggle] that:\n       he had the right to remain silent and that anything he said could\n       and would be used against him; that he had a right to consult a\n       lawyer before being questioned and to have a lawyer present\n       during questioning; that if he could not afford a lawyer, a lawyer\n       would be provided to him without cost prior to questioning; and\n       that he had the right to refuse to answer any questions and to\n       stop talking at any time.\n\n       After [Tuggle] executed the waiver, Detective Reynolds\n       conducted an interview of [Tuggle], beginning at 11:00 a.m. and\n____________________________________________\n\n\n2\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966).\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n     ending at 11:50 a.m. The detective testified that [Tuggle] was\n     cooperative, and that at no point did the conversation become\n     contentious or heated, and at no point did [Tuggle] ask to stop\n     the interview or ask for a lawyer.\n\n     Detective Reynolds then typed [Tuggle\u2019s] statement and gave it\n     to him to review and make any changes he wanted. A copy of\n     the typed statement was entered into evidence at [Tuggle\u2019s]\n     suppression hearing.     The statement on its face contains\n     [Tuggle\u2019s] explicit acknowledgment that no threats or promises\n     had been made to him to induce him to talk to Detective\n     Reynolds, and [Tuggle\u2019s] explicit acknowledgment that his\n     decision to provide a statement . . . was a product of his own\n     free will.\n\n     As the [trial court] stated on the record, [the] court fully credited\n     the testimony of Detective Reynolds in its entirety.\n\n     [Tuggle] testified on his own behalf at the suppression hearing.\n     [Tuggle\u2019s] testimony did not contradict, in any material way, the\n     testimony of Detective Reynolds. [Tuggle\u2019s] testimony was,\n     however, at odds with that of Detective Vinter in regard to the\n     conversation between the two men during which [Tuggle] agreed\n     to provide a statement to the police.\n\n     In contrast to Detective Vinter, [Tuggle] testified:\n\n        That conversation was mainly about the firearm that was\n        recovered in the apartment, more or less. Questioning me\n        about was anything on it, which would refer to like it being\n        a dirty gun or I guess a body or so being on it.\n\n     [Tuggle] further testified:\n\n        I was telling him that I\u2019m not sure if anything\u2019s on it. I\n        was telling him it\u2019s not my firearm. But I was just mostly\n        like a little timid because he was like more persistent with\n        trying to like more or less put it on me or so, or what I\n        would say would be to try to scare me.\n\n     [Tuggle] stated:\n\n        I felt intimidated because I wasn\u2019t sure. I had no idea if\n        anything would come up on the firearm.         So I was\n        intimidated. I was kind of scared.\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n      [Tuggle] testified that he was concerned that the handgun\u2014\n      which he denied owning\u2014might have been used in a crime that\n      the police would try to \u201cpin it on me\u201d because the gun was\n      discovered during a search of his residence. [Tuggle] testified\n      that this concern \u201cplayed a major role\u201d in his decision to waive\n      his Miranda rights and give a statement, testifying that he\n      thought that \u201cif I give him a statement then maybe he would\n      stop asking me about the firearm or so.\u201d\n\n      On cross-examination by the attorney for the Commonwealth,\n      [Tuggle] testified that no threats or promises were made to him\n      to induce him to make a statement, but he asserted that he\n      nonetheless felt \u201cintimidated.\u201d Asked to explain exactly what\n      Detective Vinter said that made him feel intimidated, [Tuggle]\n      testified:\n\n         He said that I better hope nothing came back on the\n         firearm. He intimidated me by saying that a lot of things\n         that\u2019s going on in Norristown as far as the unresolved\n         murders or pertaining to crimes, things of that nature, that\n         if something\u2019s on that firearm then it will reflect on me.\n         That\u2019s what was intimidating to me.\n\n      Asked directly if Detective Vinter had told him that giving a\n      statement would help him, [Tuggle] replied: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nTrial Court Opinion (\u201cT.C.O.\u201d), 3/11/2014, at 2-6 (citations to notes of\n\ntestimony omitted; some punctuation modified).\n\n      In the statement that Tuggle provided to Detective Reynolds, Tuggle\n\nadmitted to stealing blank prescription forms, to filling out these prescription\n\nforms and forging doctors\u2019 signatures, to growing marijuana plants, and to\n\nselling marijuana and Percocet.    Tuggle denied ownership of the handgun,\n\nhowever, and stated that it belonged to a woman that left it in his\n\napartment.\n\n      In his motion, Tuggle sought to suppress the statement that he\n\nprovided during the interview with Detective Reynolds.         The trial court\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\ndenied   Tuggle\u2019s   suppression   motion   because   the   court   credited   the\n\nDetectives\u2019 testimony over that provided by Tuggle and determined that\n\nTuggle\u2019s statement had been preceded by a knowing, voluntary, and\n\nintelligent waiver of his Miranda rights. T.C.O. at 8, 9. On July 16, 2013,\n\nTuggle proceeded to a nonjury trial, and he was convicted on the following\n\nday. On December 16, 2013, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing,\n\nafter which it imposed an aggregate sentence of not less than seven and one\n\nhalf years nor more than fifteen years\u2019 incarceration, to be followed by a two\n\nyear period of probation.\n\n      Tuggle filed a timely notice of appeal on January 15, 2014.             On\n\nJanuary 21, 2014, the trial court directed Tuggle to file a concise statement\n\nof errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), to be\n\nserved upon the court no later than February 11, 2014. Tuggle filed a timely\n\nconcise statement on February 7, 2014. On March 11, 2014, the trial court\n\nissued an opinion pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\n\n      Tuggle raises the following issue for our review:\n\n      Whether the trial court erred in denying [Tuggle\u2019s] Motion to\n      Suppress his statements in that such statements were not\n      preceded by a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of\n      Miranda rights as the alleged waiver was preceded by coercive\n      questioning by Detective James Vinter of [Tuggle] relating to the\n      gun found in the premises and wanting him to cooperate with\n      law enforcement authorities, which tainted the voluntariness of\n      the subsequent Miranda waiver?\n\nBrief for Tuggle at 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\n      When reviewing a trial court\u2019s order denying a suppression motion, our\n\nstandard of review is well-settled:\n\n      In reviewing a suppression ruling, we are bound by the\n      suppression court\u2019s factual findings, unless they are without\n      support in the record. We may reverse the legal conclusions\n      reached by the suppression court, however, if they are in error.\n      Thus, our standard of review of the legal conclusions reached by\n      the suppression court is de novo. Where, as here, the defendant\n      is appealing the ruling of the suppression court, we consider only\n      the evidence of the prosecution, and so much of the evidence for\n      the defense which remains uncontradicted when fairly read in\n      the context of the [suppression] record.\n\nCommonwealth v.

Specifically, Tuggle asserts that\n\nDetective Vinter questioned him about the firearm that was discovered in his\n\napartment, and that the detective intimidated him by implying that Tuggle\n\n                                      -7-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\nmay be implicated in any crimes in which the firearm was previously used.\n\nBrief for Tuggle at 22.        Detective Vinter contradicted Tuggle\u2019s testimony,\n\nasserting that he only asked Tuggle if he was willing to cooperate and\n\nprovide a statement, and that he did not question Tuggle about anything\n\nthat was found in the apartment. On review of a ruling denying suppression,\n\nwe consider only the evidence of the prosecution, and so much of the\n\nevidence for the defense which remains uncontradicted when fairly read in\n\nthe context of the entire record.         Galvin, 985 A.2d at 795.         As Tuggle\u2019s\n\ntestimony was contradicted at the suppression hearing, we may not consider\n\nit on appellate review.\n\n      The trial court fully credited Detective Vinter\u2019s testimony, and found\n\nTuggle\u2019s testimony to be incredible and unpersuasive. T.C.O. at 8. \u201cAs we\n\nbelieve   that   credibility    at   a   suppression   hearing   is   an    important\n\ndetermination best resolved through the court\u2019s personal observations, we\n\nwill not reverse a suppression court\u2019s assessment of credibility absent clear\n\nand manifest error.\u201d Commonwealth v.

Thus, even if we are to consider Tuggle\u2019s testimony\n\nconcerning his interaction with Detective Vinter, we are bound by the trial\n\ncourt\u2019s credibility determinations.\n\n      While our standard of review is highly deferential with respect to the\n\nsuppression court\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations, we afford\n\n                                          -8-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\nno deference to the suppression court\u2019s legal conclusions, and review such\n\nconclusions de novo. In re L.J., 79 A.3d at 1080 n.6. With regard to the\n\nvalidity of a waiver of Miranda rights, our Supreme Court has described the\n\nlaw of our Commonwealth as follows:\n\n     In determining whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of his Miranda\n     rights is valid, a trial court must consider: (1) whether the\n     waiver was voluntary, in the sense that the waiver was not the\n     result of governmental pressure; and (2) whether the waiver\n     was knowing and intelligent, in the sense that it was made with\n     full comprehension of both the nature of the right being\n     abandoned and the consequence of that choice.                The\n     Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing that a\n     defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.\n     Factors to be considered in determining whether a waiver is valid\n     and a confession is voluntary include: the duration and means of\n     interrogation; the defendant\u2019s physical and psychological state;\n     the conditions attendant to the detention; the attitude exhibited\n     by the police during the interrogation; and any other facts which\n     may serve to drain one\u2019s powers of resistance to suggestion and\n     coercion.\n\nCommonwealth v. Patterson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76 (Pa. 2014) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n     Tuggle was apprised fully of his Miranda rights before his interview\n\nwith Detective Reynolds, and he signed a waiver form, which indicated that\n\nhe was aware of his rights and was willing to give a voluntary statement.\n\nTuggle does not allege that Detective Reynolds coerced him, but rather that\n\nhis prior interaction with Detective Vinter \u201cintimidated\u201d him.     Notes of\n\nTestimony, Suppression Hearing, (\u201cN.T.\u201d), 7/15/2013, at 66.       As to the\n\nduration of this alleged interaction with Detective Vinter, Tuggle testified\n\nthat it was approximately five minutes. Id. at 65. Tuggle testified that he\n\n                                   -9-\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n\nwas interviewed in a room that the detectives called a \u201cholding room.\u201d Id.\n\nat 59.     While the record does not provide a detailed description of the\n\n\u201cholding room,\u201d Tuggle did not testify that the room itself was particularly\n\nintimidating or oppressive.\n\n      Tuggle     noted   that     he    had   been      consuming     marijuana     from\n\napproximately 2:30 a.m. until 5:00 a.m. on the morning of his arrest. N.T.\n\nat 67. The interview with Detective Reynolds during which Tuggle executed\n\nthe waiver of his Miranda rights began at 11:00 a.m., approximately six\n\nhours after he had stopped smoking marijuana. While the fact that Tuggle\n\nhad consumed marijuana prior to executing the waiver is relevant to\n\nTuggle\u2019s physical and psychological state, Tuggle testified that, at the time\n\nthat he gave the statement to Detective Reynolds, he was not impaired to a\n\ndegree that would prevent him from giving a statement. Id. at 69.\n\n      The most pertinent factor to be considered in determining whether\n\nTuggle\u2019s waiver is valid is the attitude exhibited by the police during the\n\ninterrogation, because Tuggle\u2019s argument is premised upon the alleged\n\nintimidation that he felt after interacting with Detective Vinter. However, as\n\nwe   discussed    above,     Tuggle\u2019s     testimony     about   the   interaction   was\n\ncontradicted by Detective Vinter\u2019s testimony.            Furthermore, the trial court\n\nappropriately    exercised      its   discretion   in   crediting   Detective   Vinter\u2019s\n\ntestimony over Tuggle\u2019s\u2014a determination that we will not disturb on appeal.\n\n      The trial court summarized the basis for its legal conclusions as\n\nfollows:\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fJ-A28028-14\n\n\n      Stated directly, this court heard no evidence indicating that any\n      improper coercive or intimidating tactics were employed to\n      induce the defendant to waive his Miranda rights and provide\n      his statement to Detective Reynolds. The evidence this court\n      heard rather supports the determination that the defendant\u2019s\n      waiver of Miranda rights and his statement to the detective\n      were voluntary, and a product of the defendant\u2019s own free will.\n\nN.T. at 101. We have analyzed the relevant factors, and have determined\n\nthat Tuggle\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights was voluntary, knowing, and\n\nintelligent. As such, his waiver was valid, and the trial court\u2019s conclusions of\n\nlaw were not erroneous.\n\n      Judgment of sentence affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.
