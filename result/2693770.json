THOMPSON, Atty. Reg. #0055879, 130 West Second Street, Suite\n2050, Dayton, Ohio 45402\n       Attorney for Defendant-Appellant\n\n                                               .............\n\nHALL, J.\n\n        {\u00b6 1}     Laurice Mitchell appeals from his conviction and sentence on charges of\n\f                                                                                                                                      \uf02d2\uf02d\n\n\nimproperly discharging a firearm at or into a habitation, having a weapon while under\n\ndisability, intimidating a crime victim, and a firearm specification.1\n\n         {\u00b6 2}         Mitchell advances four assignments of error on appeal. First, he contends the\n\ntrial court violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation right by declaring two prosecution\n\nwitnesses unavailable and permitting use of their former testimony at trial. Second, he claims\n\nthe trial court erred in admitting the two witnesses\u2019 former testimony where he lacked a\n\nmeaningful opportunity and similar motive to test and develop that testimony. Third, he\n\nasserts that the trial court erred in denying his Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nwhere the State presented insufficient evidence to prove venue and identification. Fourth, he\n\nargues that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance.\n\n         {\u00b6 3}        The present appeal stems from Mitchell\u2019s alleged involvement in events that\n\noccurred at the Northland Village apartment complex. On August 15, 2010, Shalita Williams\n\nargued with Aubrey Jenkins, the father of her four-year-old child, about child-care\n\nresponsibilities. Appellant Mitchell, who was Jenkins\u2019s friend, interjected himself into the\n\nargument. At one point, Mitchell threatened to return with a gun to kill Williams. The police\n\nwere called and when they arrived, Williams told them about Mitchell\u2019s threats and accused\n\nMitchell of having a gun and selling drugs. Later the same night, Williams began receiving\n\nthreatening text messages from a phone number she recognized as belonging to Mitchell. In\n\nthe messages, he expressed anger about Williams telling police he had a gun and sold drugs.\n\nHe used profanity and threatened to shoot her on sight.\n\n\n            1\n             A jury also found Mitchell guilty of felonious assault and retaliation. For purposes of sentencing, these offenses were merged into\n those set forth above.\n\f                                                                                            \uf02d3\uf02d\n\n\n       {\u00b6 4}    The following morning, Williams was inside her apartment when she heard\n\nbeating on the front door. According to Williams, she opened the door and saw Mitchell\n\nstanding there. He proceeded to assault her. Mitchell then left, and Williams called the police.\n\nMitchell\u2019s girlfriend and Williams\u2019s sister then appeared outside the apartment and began\n\nfighting. Police arrived while the fight was in progress and arrested both women.\n\n       {\u00b6 5}    Following his girlfriend\u2019s arrest, Mitchell repeatedly called Williams and\n\nthreatened to shoot her. Around noon that day, Williams and two friends were sitting in her\n\nliving room when multiple gunshots came through the wall of the apartment. The women took\n\ncover and called the police, who arrived within one minute. Police were present in the\n\napartment when Williams received a phone call from Mitchell\u2019s cell phone. During the call,\n\nwhich Williams played over a speaker, Mitchell referred to the shooting as \u201cround one\u201d and\n\nwarned her that he was going to shoot at her every time he saw her.\n\n       {\u00b6 6}    Police pin-pointed the location of Mitchell\u2019s cell phone to an area near\n\nWilliams\u2019s apartment. Deputies in the area saw Mitchell driving a green Dodge Intrepid. They\n\napproached him in the parking lot of an adjoining apartment complex and ordered him out of\n\nhis car. After unsuccessfully attempting to flee, Mitchell was placed under arrest. Police later\n\nwatched a surveillance video that captured the shooting on tape. It showed a man matching\n\nMitchell\u2019s physical appearance, and wearing clothes matching those he was wearing at the\n\ntime of his arrest, fire several shots into Williams\u2019s apartment and run past two individuals\n\nstanding outside. During their investigation, police located the two individuals who had\n\nwitnessed the shooting. The witnesses, Kiera Veal and Marquasha Stewart, positively\n\nidentified Mitchell as the shooter. Months later, Mitchell began calling Williams from jail\n\f                                                                                              \uf02d4\uf02d\n\n\nand threatening to kill her. On another occasion, Williams received a call from a third-party\n\nwho offered her money not to testify.\n\n        {\u00b6 7}    Following Mitchell\u2019s indictment, the trial court overruled a motion to\n\nsuppress that challenged, inter alia, the eyewitness identification by Veal and Stewart. The\n\ncase then proceeded to trial. Despite the issuance of subpoenas and material-witness warrants,\n\nVeal and Stewart refused to appear to testify. After holding a hearing on the matter, the trial\n\ncourt declared them unavailable and allowed the State to use as evidence a videotape of their\n\ntestimony from the hearing on Mitchell\u2019s motion to suppress. The jury ultimately convicted\n\nMitchell of all charges, and the trial court imposed an aggregate twenty-one-year prison term.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n        {\u00b6 8}    In his first assignment of error, Mitchell contends the trial court erred in\n\ndeclaring Veal and Stewart unavailable to testify at trial and allowing the State to present their\n\nsuppression-hearing testimony to the jury. More specifically, he argues that the State failed to\n\nestablish a reasonable, good-faith effort to locate the two women and to secure their\n\nattendance at trial.\n\n        {\u00b6 9}    This court recently summarized the law governing the foregoing issue in State\n\nv. Jackson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24430, 2012-Ohio-2335:\n\n                The United States Supreme Court has held that testimonial,\n\n        out-of-court statements are barred under the Confrontation Clause unless the\n\n        witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to\n\n        cross-examine the witness, regardless of whether the statements are deemed\n\n        reliable by the trial court. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct.\n\f                                                                                      \uf02d5\uf02d\n\n\n1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Evid.R. 804(A), which addresses exceptions to\n\nthe hearsay rule, defines unavailability as follows: \u201c\u2018Unavailability as a\n\nwitness\u2019 includes any * * * situations in which the declarant: * * * (5) is absent\n\nfrom the hearing and the proponent of the declarant\u2019s statement has been\n\nunable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance * * * by process or other\n\nreasonable means.\u201d\n\n       Evid.R. 804(B)(1) provides that, if the declarant is unavailable as a\n\nwitness, the following are not excluded by the hearsay rule: \u201cFormer testimony.\n\nTestimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different\n\nproceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the course of the\n\nsame or another proceeding, if the party against whom the testimony is now\n\noffered * * * had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony\n\nby direct, cross, or redirect examination. * * *\u201d\n\n       In criminal cases, the State bears the burden to produce the declarant\n\nregarding hearsay made at a prior judicial hearing, or to establish that the\n\ndeclarant is unavailable to testify; the State must satisfy this burden in order to\n\nutilize hearsay made at the prior judicial proceeding. State v. Smith, 2d Dist.\n\nMontgomery No. 22926, 2010-Ohio-745, \u00b610, citing Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S.\n\n56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). The Confrontation Clause of the\n\nSixth Amendment and Evid.R. 804(B)(1) normally require a showing by the\n\nState that the hearsay declarant is unavailable despite reasonable efforts made\n\nin good faith to secure his presence for trial. Id. at \u00b6 11, citing State v.\n\f                                                                                              \uf02d6\uf02d\n\n\n       Keairns, 9 Ohio St.3d 228, 460 N.E.2d 245 (1984). A showing of\n\n       unavailability must be based on testimony of witnesses rather than hearsay;\n\n       mere statements that a search has been made lack sufficient particularity to\n\n       allow the court to determine what steps have been taken and whether they were\n\n       reasonable. Id. at \u00b6 11, \u00b6 13.\n\n               Decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence at trial are within the\n\n       broad discretion of the trial court and will be upheld absent an abuse of\n\n       discretion and material prejudice. State v. Haines, 112 Ohio St.3d 393,\n\n       2006-Ohio-6711, 860 N.E.2d 91, \u00b650; State v. Noling, 98 Ohio St.3d 44,\n\n       2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, \u00b643.\n\nJackson at \u00b6 48-51.\n\n       {\u00b6 10} With the foregoing standards in mind, we find no merit in Mitchell\u2019s\n\nchallenge to the trial court\u2019s unavailability ruling. Notably, at the outset of the hearing below,\n\nwhich took place on the first day of trial, defense counsel clarified that his \u201conly objection\u201d to\n\nthe State\u2019s use of Veal\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s suppression-hearing testimony was that he had not had\n\nthe opportunity for meaningful cross examination. Defense counsel did not object on the basis\n\nthat unavailability could not be established. (Tr. Vol. I at 227-228). Given defense counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to dispute unavailability below, Mitchell has waived all but plain error.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} But even if Mitchell had preserved the issue, we would find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling. Despite defense counsel\u2019s lack of an objection, the State\n\nproceeded to present sworn testimony from detective Brad Daugherty regarding efforts taken\n\nto secure the two witnesses\u2019 appearance. Daugherty explained that Veal and Stewart\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d7\uf02d\n\n\npreviously had appeared and testified in the suppression hearing once material-witness\n\nwarrants were issued. (Id. at 228-229). Daugherty testified that he then spoke to Veal on the\n\nphone a few days before trial and advised her that she needed to appear. When Veal replied\n\nthat she could not come on the first day, Daugherty told her that she probably could testify on\n\nthe second day. Daugherty also gave Veal the prosecutor\u2019s phone number. (Id. at 229).\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Daugherty further testified that he had visited the separate residences of\n\nVeal\u2019s parents on multiple occasions. Each time, he was told that Veal did not live there but\n\nthat he would be called if they heard from her. (Id. at 229-230). Veal previously had given\n\npolice her mother\u2019s address as her own, but Daugherty never found her there. (Id. at 230).\n\nDespite the issuance of subpoenas, he failed to make contact with her. (Id.). Finally,\n\nDaugherty testified that a deputy was in the process of attempting to serve Veal with a\n\nmaterial-witness warrant to compel her appearance at trial. To Daugherty\u2019s knowledge,\n\nhowever, Veal had not been located. (Id.).\n\n       {\u00b6 13} With regard to Stewart, Daugherty testified that he had not had any recent\n\ncontact with her. Shortly before trial, he had gone to her last known address to attempt to\n\nserve a material-witness warrant, but he received no answer. (Id.). Daugherty also contacted\n\nthe office at the apartment complex where Stewart was believed to live. (Id. at 231). Upon\n\nbeing told that she had not turned in her keys or given notice that she was vacating, Daugherty\n\nsent deputies to the apartment. (Id. at 231). They spoke to neighbors who reported that they\n\nhad not seen Stewart for days and did not know where she could be found. (Id.). While\n\nattempting to serve a material-witness warrant for trial, deputies obtained a key and entered\n\nthe apartment. They found some items inside, but it appeared as if Stewart might have\n\f                                                                                             \uf02d8\uf02d\n\n\nvacated. (Id.). Stewart subsequently called the police from a blocked phone number and told\n\nthem to \u201cleave [her] alone.\u201d (Id.). On cross examination, Daugherty testified that he had been\n\ntrying to make contact with Veal and Stewart for at least a month. (Id. at 232). Daugherty\n\nadded that he had no working phone number for Stewart and that neither woman was\n\nemployed. (Id. at 233).\n\n       {\u00b6 14} After hearing Daugherty\u2019s testimony, the trial court found that the State had\n\nestablished unavailability. While Mitchell insists more could have been done to locate Veal\n\nand Stewart, the test is whether the State made reasonable, good-faith efforts to secure their\n\nappearance, not whether it took every conceivable step. Keairns, 9 Ohio St.3d at 248, 460\n\nN.E.2d 245; Hardy v. Cross, 132 S.Ct. 490, 495, 181 L.Ed. 468 (2011) (\u201c[W]hen a witness\n\ndisappears before trial, it is always possible to think of additional steps that the prosecution\n\nmight have taken to secure the witness\u2019 presence, * * * but the Sixth Amendment does not\n\nrequire the prosecution to exhaust every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b6 15} Before the trial court declared the two women unavailable, subpoenas and\n\nmaterial-witness warrants had been issued to compel their appearance. In addition, Detective\n\nDaugherty visited known addresses on multiple occasions, spoke to Veal on the phone,\n\ncontacted Stewart\u2019s neighbors, and had deputies enter her apartment. Daugherty could not\n\ncontact employers because neither woman worked. He also had no current phone number for\n\nStewart. After trying for more than a month, he failed to make direct contact with either\n\nwoman and did not know their whereabouts. In light of these facts, the trial court did not err in\n\nfinding the existence of reasonable, good-faith efforts to secure their appearance.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Mitchell\u2019s reliance on State v. Smith, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22926,\n\f                                                                                            \uf02d9\uf02d\n\n\n2010-Ohio-745, fails to persuade us otherwise. In Smith, a detective had spoken to the\n\nwitness, Cassie Davis, at her apartment shortly before trial. She indicated that she would not\n\nappear despite the issuance of a subpoena. The witness also told police she would hide if a\n\nwarrant were issued. When the witness failed to appear for trial, police went to her apartment\n\nand knocked on her door. She did not answer. Police then spoke to the witness\u2019s sister, who\n\nadvised them that the witness in fact was home. Id. at \u00b6 19-21. On review, this court reasoned:\n\n               We agree with Smith that the State failed to demonstrate that it had\n\n        exerted reasonable efforts to secure Cassie Davis\u2019 appearance for trial. The\n\n        State knew as early as the Friday before trial that the sole witness who could\n\n        convict the defendant had received a subpoena and had no intention to appear\n\n        for trial. The State was informed by Ms. Davis\u2019 sister that Ms. Davis intended\n\n        to hide in her apartment and refuse to answer the door if requested to come to\n\n        court. The trial court permitted the State to introduce the witness\u2019 former\n\n        testimony even before efforts to bring her to court under a material witness\n\n        warrant had been attempted. Surely, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to\n\n        confront his accuser requires something more than the efforts that were used to\n\n        secure Ms. Davis\u2019 appearance than was demonstrated by the State of Ohio.\n\nId. at \u00b6 24.\n\n        {\u00b6 17} Unlike Smith, police in this case did not simply serve a subpoena, wait until\n\nVeal and Stewart failed to appear, knock on their door, and then give up. As set forth above,\n\nthe two women were subpoenaed, warrants were issued, and Detective Daugherty actively\n\nsought them out, describing the specific actions he took. Other deputies also assisted by\n\f                                                                                                                                 \uf02d10\uf02d\n\n\nsearching Stewart\u2019s apartment and speaking to neighbors. We are satisfied that the facts\n\nbefore us are sufficiently distinguishable from Smith to support a different result. The first\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n         {\u00b6 18} In his second assignment of error, Mitchell claims the trial court erred in\n\nadmitting Veal\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s former testimony where he lacked a meaningful opportunity\n\nand similar motive for cross examination.\n\n         {\u00b6 19} Although Mitchell raises his argument under the Sixth Amendment, the actual\n\ntest he applies is found in Evid.R. 804(B)(1).2 The rule provides that \u201cformer testimony\u201d is\n\nnot excluded under the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable and the testimony was\n\n\u201cgiven as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding * * * if the party\n\nagainst whom the testimony is now offered * * * had an opportunity and similar motive to\n\ndevelop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 20} Having reviewed the suppression-hearing transcript, we believe Mitchell had\n\na similar motive for developing the women\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing and at trial,\n\nnamely to challenge their eyewitness identification of him as the perpetrator\u2014the only real\n\nissue in the case. Compare State v. White, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20324, 2005-Ohio-212,\n\n\u00b6 26 (\u201cWith respect to the admission at trial of Hurlburt\u2019s former testimony at the suppression\n\nhearing pursuant to Evid.R. 804(B)(1), we conclude that Defendant had a similar \u2018motive\u2019 for\n\ndeveloping Hurlburt\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing as would exist at trial, which was\n\n\n           2\n             In any event, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause has been interpreted as containing a similar requirement for\n meaningful cross examination. See, e.g., State v. Mills, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21146, 2005-Ohio-2128, \u00b6 26 (\u201cIt is the opportunity to\n meaningfully test and develop by direct and cross-examination the witness\u2019 testimony at the prior proceeding where the witness is under oath\n that provides the indicia of trustworthiness and reliability that satisfies the confrontation clause.\u201d).\n\f                                                                                             \uf02d11\uf02d\n\n\nto question the reliability of Hurlburt\u2019s identification of Defendant as his attacker, as the\n\nidentity of the perpetrator was the central issue in this case.\u201d). \u201cAn identical motive to develop\n\ntestimony is not required by Evid.R. 804(B)(1), only a similar motive.\u201d Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Mitchell also contends he lacked a meaningful opportunity for cross\n\nexamination at the suppression hearing. Specifically, he suggests that his attorney lacked not\n\njust the motive, but also the opportunity to delve into what Veal and Stewart saw because the\n\nhearing was limited to the suggestiveness of the photo-spread. We disagree.\n\n       {\u00b6 22} Veal and Stewart did not testify about the suggestiveness of the photo-spread\n\nitself. They did provide some testimony, however, about the identification procedure. But they\n\nalso testified about other things, including (1) the fact that they knew Mitchell before the\n\nshooting incident, (2) where they were at the time of the shooting, and (3) what they saw\n\nMitchell do. On cross examination, defense counsel questioned the witnesses regarding their\n\nprior knowledge of Mitchell and their ability to observe the incident. If defense counsel had\n\nother questions to ask about what they saw or the reliability of their identification, he could\n\nhave asked them. On appeal, Mitchell has not identified anything in particular that he believes\n\na \u201cmeaningful\u201d cross examination would have covered that was not asked by his attorney at\n\nthe suppression hearing. Although defense counsel\u2019s questioning was not lengthy, we are\n\npersuaded that a meaningful opportunity for cross examination existed.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} Finally, even if the trial court had erred in allowing the State to use Veal\u2019s and\n\nStewart\u2019s suppression-hearing testimony at trial, we would find the error to be harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. This is so because the evidence of Mitchell\u2019s guilt was\n\noverwhelming. The day after Mitchell sent Shalita Williams threatening messages, he\n\f                                                                                            \uf02d12\uf02d\n\n\nappeared at her door and assaulted her. He then began calling her and threatening to shoot her.\n\nWithin hours, shots were fired into her apartment. With police still at the scene, Mitchell\n\ncalled Williams and threatened to shoot at her again. A surveillance video showed a man\n\nmatching Mitchell\u2019s physical description and clothing firing shots into Williams\u2019s apartment.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Mitchell called Williams from jail, threatening once again to kill her.\n\nEven setting aside the identification testimony from Veal and Stewart, the foregoing evidence\n\noverwhelmingly points to Mitchell\u2019s guilt. Thus, any possible error in the trial court\u2019s\n\nadmission of the suppression-hearing testimony was harmless. Compare White at \u00b6 32. The\n\nsecond assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} In his third assignment of error, Mitchell contends the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal on the charges of retaliation and intimidation of a\n\ncrime victim. These charges were based on telephone calls the victim, Shalita Williams,\n\nreceived after Mitchell\u2019s arrest.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} On appeal, Mitchell asserts that the State failed to prove identity because\n\nWilliams never identified his voice on the calls. He further claims the State failed to establish\n\nvenue by proving that the calls were made from the Montgomery County jail.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} \u201cWhen considering a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, the trial court must\n\nconstrue the evidence in a light most favorable to the State and determine whether reasonable\n\nminds could reach different conclusions on whether the evidence proves each element of the\n\noffense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Haggerty, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n24405, 2011-Ohio-6705, \u00b6 19. \u201cA Crim.R. 29 motion challenges the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence. A sufficiency of the evidence argument challenges whether the State has presented\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d13\uf02d\n\n\nadequate evidence on each element of the offense to allow the case to go to the jury or sustain\n\nthe verdict as a matter of law.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20.\n\n        {\u00b6 27} Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the record\n\nsupports reasonable inferences that Mitchell made the calls. Although Williams did not\n\nidentify him by name when testifying about the calls, her testimony left no doubt that Mitchell\n\nwas the \u201che\u201d to whom she was referring. Indeed, the context of her testimony supports no\n\nreasonable inference other than that Mitchell was the caller. (Tr. Vol. I at 148-149). According\n\nto Williams, the calls continued until she reported them. (Id. at 149). Detective Daugherty\n\nacknowledged receiving such a complaint from Williams about Mitchell making threatening\n\ncalls. (Id. at 318). Therefore, the State presented legally sufficient evidence to establish the\n\nidentity of the caller.\n\n        {\u00b6 28} We reach the same conclusion regarding venue. Williams testified that the\n\ncalls were coming from \u201cthe jail.\u201d (Id. at 148). Moreover, detective Daugherty, a Montgomery\n\nCounty sheriff\u2019s deputy, testified about obtaining phone records from \u201cour jail\u201d and \u201cthe\n\nCounty Jail.\u201d (Id. at 318-320). He identified 83 phone calls from \u201cthe jail\u201d to Williams\u2019s cell\n\nphone. (Id. at 324). This testimony was legally sufficient to establish venue in Montgomery\n\nCounty. Accordingly, the third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n        {\u00b6 29} In his fourth assignment of error, Mitchell alleges that he received\n\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. To prevail on this claim, he must\n\nshow that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance\n\nprejudiced him. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674\n\n(1984). Prejudice exists where \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d14\uf02d\n\n\ndeficient performance, the outcome would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} Mitchell first argues that his attorney provided deficient performance by\n\nfailing to conduct a \u201cvigorous cross examination\u201d of Veal and Stewart, the eyewitnesses\n\nwhose suppression-hearing testimony was used at trial. According to Mitchell, the two women\n\nshould have been cross examined \u201cabout their perceptions of the event and their reliability.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 31} Having reviewed the suppression-hearing transcript, however, we note that\n\nboth women were cross examined. On direct examination, Veal and Stewart testified that they\n\nknew Mitchell before the shooting incident. They also testified about picking him out of a\n\nphoto-spread and about being sure he was the shooter. On cross examination, defense counsel\n\ninquired into the witnesses\u2019 prior knowledge of Mitchell and their ability to observe the\n\nshooting incident. Defense counsel also asked questions to determine whether the women had\n\nbeen coached or influenced prior to identifying Mitchell\u2019s picture.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} On appeal, Mitchell fails to identify anything in particular that defense\n\ncounsel should have asked to make the cross examination sufficiently \u201cvigorous.\u201d Based on\n\nour review of the testimony, we fail to see any deficient representation in defense counsel\u2019s\n\nquestioning.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Mitchell next alleges deficient representation based on his attorney\u2019s failure to\n\nobject to hearsay testimony from detective Jeff Papanak. At trial, Papanak testified that he\n\nresponded to the shooting scene within about one minute. Upon arriving, he spoke to three or\n\nfour females who identified \u201cSlim\u201d as the shooter. (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 212-213). Papanak later\n\ndetermined that \u201cSlim\u201d was defendant Mitchell. (Id.).\n\n       {\u00b6 34} Although Mitchell contends Papanak\u2019s testimony about being told \u201cSlim\u201d was\n\f                                                                                               \uf02d15\uf02d\n\n\nthe shooter was hearsay, defense counsel reasonably could have declined to object on the basis\n\nof Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). The females to whom Papanak spoke included                   Kiera Veal,\n\nMarquasha Stewart, Shalita Williams, and Lashana Crawford. (See, e.g, Tr. Vol. I at 145).\n\nPapanak\u2019s testimony that these women identified \u201cSlim\u201d as the shooter at least arguably met\n\nthe requirements for admissibility under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). The rule provides that a\n\nstatement is not hearsay if \u201cthe declarant testifies at trial or hearing and is subject to\n\ncross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * one of identification of\n\na person soon after perceiving the person, if the circumstances demonstrate the reliability of\n\nthe prior identification.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 35} Here Veal and Stewart testified at a pretrial suppression hearing and identified\n\nMitchell, who they knew as \u201cSlim,\u201d as the person they saw shooting a gun at Williams\u2019s\n\napartment. (Suppression Tr. at 9-11, 18-19). During the hearing, Veal also reaffirmed the\n\ncontent of a police statement she had provided at the scene. In it, Veal stated that she saw\n\n\u201cSlim\u201d run up to a gate, pull out a gun, and start firing. (Id. at 11-12). The two women were\n\nsubject to cross examination about their identification, their statements about \u201cSlim\u201d were\n\nones of identification, and the trial court found the statements sufficiently reliable to allow a\n\nvideo of the suppression hearing to be played as evidence at trial. For purposes of Evid.R.\n\n801(D)(1)(c), it matters not that Veal and Stewart were unavailable to testify at trial. \u201c[A]\n\nprior identification that is found reliable by a trial judge falls outside the hearsay rule if it is\n\nshown that the [victim], either at trial or a hearing, had been or is subject to\n\ncross-examination under oath concerning the identification statement and the [victim]\n\nresponds willingly to questions about the previous identification. If these conditions are met\n\f                                                                                                                                      \uf02d16\uf02d\n\n\nand the judge finds the statement of prior identification reliable, then the statement of the\n\ndeclarant can be admitted at trial through a third person to whom or in whose presence the\n\nidentification was made.\u201d State v. Boston, 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 124, 545 N.E.2d 1220 (1989)\n\n(Emphasis added.) 3 Finally, we note that the other two women, Williams and Crawford,\n\nactually testified at trial and identified Mitchell as the shooter. (See, e.g., Tr. Vol. I at 146,\n\n177-178, 182).4 They were subject to cross examination, their identifications were made soon\n\nafter the event, and the circumstances demonstrated reliability insofar as they knew Mitchell\n\nbeforehand.\n\n         {\u00b6 36} Based on the foregoing analysis, we do not find that defense counsel provided\n\ndeficient representation by failing to lodge a hearsay objection to Papanak\u2019s testimony that the\n\nwitnesses told him that \u201cSlim\u201d (Mitchell) was the shooter. But even assuming, arguendo, that\n\ndefense counsel should have objected, the failure to do so constituted harmless error beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. As we noted in our analysis of the second assignment of error above, the\n\nevidence of Mitchell\u2019s guilt, and his identity by the nickname \u201cSlim,\u201d was overwhelming.\n\n         {\u00b6 37} Mitchell also claims deficient representation based on defense counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to object to (1) shoe-print testimony from deputy Patrick O\u2019Connell, an evidence\n\ntechnician and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s argument about a \u201cmatching\u201d print.\n\n            3\n            In Boston, the Ohio Supreme Court reasoned that \u201cadmitting a child\u2019s out-of-court identification of the perpetrator under Evid.R.\n 801(D)(1)(c), without the child\u2019s testimony at trial, requires the trial judge to conduct a voir dire examination of the child at which the child,\n under oath, is subject to cross-examination concerning her identification and responds willingly to questions about her identification.\u201d\n (Emphasis added.) Boston at 124. Similarly, although Veal and Stewart did not testify at trial, they did testify under oath, and subject to cross\n examination, at a pretrial suppression hearing where they answered questions concerning their identification of Mitchell.\n            4\n            Although Williams and Crawford were inside the apartment and did not see the shooter, they both provided testimony that\n circumstantially identified Mitchell as the gunman.\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d17\uf02d\n\n\n       {\u00b6 38} At trial, O\u2019Connell testified that he found a couple of \u201cfresh\u201d prints in dirt\n\noutside the victim\u2019s apartment. He took pictures of the prints as well as pictures of the bottom\n\nof Mitchell\u2019s shoe. In closing argument, the prosecutor claimed the print in the dirt matched\n\nthe pattern on Mitchell\u2019s shoe. On appeal, Mitchell contends O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony about the\n\nprint found in the dirt was objectionable because he was not an expert in shoe prints. Mitchell\n\nfurther contends the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was objectionable because the assertion\n\nabout the print in the dirt matching Mitchell\u2019s shoe tread was a mischaracterization.\n\n       {\u00b6 39} Upon review, we find nothing objectionable in the disputed testimony.\n\nO\u2019Connell admitted that he was not a shoe-print expert and that he could not tell the age of the\n\nprint in the dirt. (Id. at 293, 295). He explained that the print he photographed appeared to be\n\n\u201cfresh\u201d insofar as it was well-defined and did not appear to be covered with dust or lose dirt.\n\n(Id.). In our view, any potential weaknesses in O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony went to its weight rather\n\nthan its admissibility. We also see nothing objectionable about the prosecutor\u2019s statement, in\n\nclosing argument, that the tread pattern on Mitchell\u2019s shoe \u201cmatched\u201d the print found in the\n\ndirt. (Id. at 357). The claim constituted permissible argument with which the jury was free to\n\nagree or disagree based on its own interpretation of the evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 40} Finally, Mitchell claims deficient representation based on defense counsel\u2019s\n\nconcession that Veal and Stewart were unavailable to testify at trial.

THOMPSON, Atty. Reg. #0055879, 130 West Second Street, Suite\n2050, Dayton, Ohio 45402\n       Attorney for Defendant-Appellant\n\n                                               .............\n\nHALL, J.\n\n        {\u00b6 1}     Laurice Mitchell appeals from his conviction and sentence on charges of\n\f                                                                                                                                      \uf02d2\uf02d\n\n\nimproperly discharging a firearm at or into a habitation, having a weapon while under\n\ndisability, intimidating a crime victim, and a firearm specification.1\n\n         {\u00b6 2}         Mitchell advances four assignments of error on appeal. First, he contends the\n\ntrial court violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation right by declaring two prosecution\n\nwitnesses unavailable and permitting use of their former testimony at trial. Second, he claims\n\nthe trial court erred in admitting the two witnesses\u2019 former testimony where he lacked a\n\nmeaningful opportunity and similar motive to test and develop that testimony. Third, he\n\nasserts that the trial court erred in denying his Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nwhere the State presented insufficient evidence to prove venue and identification. Fourth, he\n\nargues that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance.\n\n         {\u00b6 3}        The present appeal stems from Mitchell\u2019s alleged involvement in events that\n\noccurred at the Northland Village apartment complex. On August 15, 2010, Shalita Williams\n\nargued with Aubrey Jenkins, the father of her four-year-old child, about child-care\n\nresponsibilities. Appellant Mitchell, who was Jenkins\u2019s friend, interjected himself into the\n\nargument. At one point, Mitchell threatened to return with a gun to kill Williams. The police\n\nwere called and when they arrived, Williams told them about Mitchell\u2019s threats and accused\n\nMitchell of having a gun and selling drugs. Later the same night, Williams began receiving\n\nthreatening text messages from a phone number she recognized as belonging to Mitchell. In\n\nthe messages, he expressed anger about Williams telling police he had a gun and sold drugs.\n\nHe used profanity and threatened to shoot her on sight.\n\n\n            1\n             A jury also found Mitchell guilty of felonious assault and retaliation. For purposes of sentencing, these offenses were merged into\n those set forth above.\n\f                                                                                            \uf02d3\uf02d\n\n\n       {\u00b6 4}    The following morning, Williams was inside her apartment when she heard\n\nbeating on the front door. According to Williams, she opened the door and saw Mitchell\n\nstanding there. He proceeded to assault her. Mitchell then left, and Williams called the police.\n\nMitchell\u2019s girlfriend and Williams\u2019s sister then appeared outside the apartment and began\n\nfighting. Police arrived while the fight was in progress and arrested both women.\n\n       {\u00b6 5}    Following his girlfriend\u2019s arrest, Mitchell repeatedly called Williams and\n\nthreatened to shoot her. Around noon that day, Williams and two friends were sitting in her\n\nliving room when multiple gunshots came through the wall of the apartment. The women took\n\ncover and called the police, who arrived within one minute. Police were present in the\n\napartment when Williams received a phone call from Mitchell\u2019s cell phone. During the call,\n\nwhich Williams played over a speaker, Mitchell referred to the shooting as \u201cround one\u201d and\n\nwarned her that he was going to shoot at her every time he saw her.\n\n       {\u00b6 6}    Police pin-pointed the location of Mitchell\u2019s cell phone to an area near\n\nWilliams\u2019s apartment. Deputies in the area saw Mitchell driving a green Dodge Intrepid. They\n\napproached him in the parking lot of an adjoining apartment complex and ordered him out of\n\nhis car. After unsuccessfully attempting to flee, Mitchell was placed under arrest. Police later\n\nwatched a surveillance video that captured the shooting on tape. It showed a man matching\n\nMitchell\u2019s physical appearance, and wearing clothes matching those he was wearing at the\n\ntime of his arrest, fire several shots into Williams\u2019s apartment and run past two individuals\n\nstanding outside. During their investigation, police located the two individuals who had\n\nwitnessed the shooting. The witnesses, Kiera Veal and Marquasha Stewart, positively\n\nidentified Mitchell as the shooter. Months later, Mitchell began calling Williams from jail\n\f                                                                                              \uf02d4\uf02d\n\n\nand threatening to kill her. On another occasion, Williams received a call from a third-party\n\nwho offered her money not to testify.\n\n        {\u00b6 7}    Following Mitchell\u2019s indictment, the trial court overruled a motion to\n\nsuppress that challenged, inter alia, the eyewitness identification by Veal and Stewart. The\n\ncase then proceeded to trial. Despite the issuance of subpoenas and material-witness warrants,\n\nVeal and Stewart refused to appear to testify. After holding a hearing on the matter, the trial\n\ncourt declared them unavailable and allowed the State to use as evidence a videotape of their\n\ntestimony from the hearing on Mitchell\u2019s motion to suppress. The jury ultimately convicted\n\nMitchell of all charges, and the trial court imposed an aggregate twenty-one-year prison term.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\n        {\u00b6 8}    In his first assignment of error, Mitchell contends the trial court erred in\n\ndeclaring Veal and Stewart unavailable to testify at trial and allowing the State to present their\n\nsuppression-hearing testimony to the jury. More specifically, he argues that the State failed to\n\nestablish a reasonable, good-faith effort to locate the two women and to secure their\n\nattendance at trial.\n\n        {\u00b6 9}    This court recently summarized the law governing the foregoing issue in State\n\nv. Jackson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24430, 2012-Ohio-2335:\n\n                The United States Supreme Court has held that testimonial,\n\n        out-of-court statements are barred under the Confrontation Clause unless the\n\n        witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to\n\n        cross-examine the witness, regardless of whether the statements are deemed\n\n        reliable by the trial court.

Notably, at the outset of the hearing below,\n\nwhich took place on the first day of trial, defense counsel clarified that his \u201conly objection\u201d to\n\nthe State\u2019s use of Veal\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s suppression-hearing testimony was that he had not had\n\nthe opportunity for meaningful cross examination. Defense counsel did not object on the basis\n\nthat unavailability could not be established. (Tr. Vol. I at 227-228). Given defense counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to dispute unavailability below, Mitchell has waived all but plain error.\n\n       {\u00b6 11} But even if Mitchell had preserved the issue, we would find no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the trial court\u2019s ruling. Despite defense counsel\u2019s lack of an objection, the State\n\nproceeded to present sworn testimony from detective Brad Daugherty regarding efforts taken\n\nto secure the two witnesses\u2019 appearance. Daugherty explained that Veal and Stewart\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d7\uf02d\n\n\npreviously had appeared and testified in the suppression hearing once material-witness\n\nwarrants were issued. (Id. at 228-229). Daugherty testified that he then spoke to Veal on the\n\nphone a few days before trial and advised her that she needed to appear. When Veal replied\n\nthat she could not come on the first day, Daugherty told her that she probably could testify on\n\nthe second day. Daugherty also gave Veal the prosecutor\u2019s phone number. (Id. at 229).\n\n       {\u00b6 12} Daugherty further testified that he had visited the separate residences of\n\nVeal\u2019s parents on multiple occasions. Each time, he was told that Veal did not live there but\n\nthat he would be called if they heard from her. (Id. at 229-230). Veal previously had given\n\npolice her mother\u2019s address as her own, but Daugherty never found her there. (Id. at 230).\n\nDespite the issuance of subpoenas, he failed to make contact with her. (Id.). Finally,\n\nDaugherty testified that a deputy was in the process of attempting to serve Veal with a\n\nmaterial-witness warrant to compel her appearance at trial. To Daugherty\u2019s knowledge,\n\nhowever, Veal had not been located. (Id.).\n\n       {\u00b6 13} With regard to Stewart, Daugherty testified that he had not had any recent\n\ncontact with her. Shortly before trial, he had gone to her last known address to attempt to\n\nserve a material-witness warrant, but he received no answer. (Id.). Daugherty also contacted\n\nthe office at the apartment complex where Stewart was believed to live. (Id. at 231). Upon\n\nbeing told that she had not turned in her keys or given notice that she was vacating, Daugherty\n\nsent deputies to the apartment. (Id. at 231). They spoke to neighbors who reported that they\n\nhad not seen Stewart for days and did not know where she could be found. (Id.). While\n\nattempting to serve a material-witness warrant for trial, deputies obtained a key and entered\n\nthe apartment. They found some items inside, but it appeared as if Stewart might have\n\f                                                                                             \uf02d8\uf02d\n\n\nvacated. (Id.). Stewart subsequently called the police from a blocked phone number and told\n\nthem to \u201cleave [her] alone.\u201d (Id.). On cross examination, Daugherty testified that he had been\n\ntrying to make contact with Veal and Stewart for at least a month. (Id. at 232). Daugherty\n\nadded that he had no working phone number for Stewart and that neither woman was\n\nemployed. (Id. at 233).\n\n       {\u00b6 14} After hearing Daugherty\u2019s testimony, the trial court found that the State had\n\nestablished unavailability. While Mitchell insists more could have been done to locate Veal\n\nand Stewart, the test is whether the State made reasonable, good-faith efforts to secure their\n\nappearance, not whether it took every conceivable step.

In addition, Detective\n\nDaugherty visited known addresses on multiple occasions, spoke to Veal on the phone,\n\ncontacted Stewart\u2019s neighbors, and had deputies enter her apartment. Daugherty could not\n\ncontact employers because neither woman worked. He also had no current phone number for\n\nStewart. After trying for more than a month, he failed to make direct contact with either\n\nwoman and did not know their whereabouts. In light of these facts, the trial court did not err in\n\nfinding the existence of reasonable, good-faith efforts to secure their appearance.\n\n       {\u00b6 16} Mitchell\u2019s reliance on State v. Smith, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22926,\n\f                                                                                            \uf02d9\uf02d\n\n\n2010-Ohio-745, fails to persuade us otherwise. In Smith, a detective had spoken to the\n\nwitness, Cassie Davis, at her apartment shortly before trial. She indicated that she would not\n\nappear despite the issuance of a subpoena. The witness also told police she would hide if a\n\nwarrant were issued. When the witness failed to appear for trial, police went to her apartment\n\nand knocked on her door. She did not answer. Police then spoke to the witness\u2019s sister, who\n\nadvised them that the witness in fact was home. Id. at \u00b6 19-21. On review, this court reasoned:\n\n               We agree with Smith that the State failed to demonstrate that it had\n\n        exerted reasonable efforts to secure Cassie Davis\u2019 appearance for trial. The\n\n        State knew as early as the Friday before trial that the sole witness who could\n\n        convict the defendant had received a subpoena and had no intention to appear\n\n        for trial. The State was informed by Ms. Davis\u2019 sister that Ms. Davis intended\n\n        to hide in her apartment and refuse to answer the door if requested to come to\n\n        court. The trial court permitted the State to introduce the witness\u2019 former\n\n        testimony even before efforts to bring her to court under a material witness\n\n        warrant had been attempted. Surely, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to\n\n        confront his accuser requires something more than the efforts that were used to\n\n        secure Ms. Davis\u2019 appearance than was demonstrated by the State of Ohio.\n\nId. at \u00b6 24.\n\n        {\u00b6 17} Unlike Smith, police in this case did not simply serve a subpoena, wait until\n\nVeal and Stewart failed to appear, knock on their door, and then give up. As set forth above,\n\nthe two women were subpoenaed, warrants were issued, and Detective Daugherty actively\n\nsought them out, describing the specific actions he took. Other deputies also assisted by\n\f                                                                                                                                 \uf02d10\uf02d\n\n\nsearching Stewart\u2019s apartment and speaking to neighbors. We are satisfied that the facts\n\nbefore us are sufficiently distinguishable from Smith to support a different result. The first\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n         {\u00b6 18} In his second assignment of error, Mitchell claims the trial court erred in\n\nadmitting Veal\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s former testimony where he lacked a meaningful opportunity\n\nand similar motive for cross examination.\n\n         {\u00b6 19} Although Mitchell raises his argument under the Sixth Amendment, the actual\n\ntest he applies is found in Evid.R. 804(B)(1).2 The rule provides that \u201cformer testimony\u201d is\n\nnot excluded under the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable and the testimony was\n\n\u201cgiven as a witness at another hearing of the same or a different proceeding * * * if the party\n\nagainst whom the testimony is now offered * * * had an opportunity and similar motive to\n\ndevelop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\u201d\n\n         {\u00b6 20} Having reviewed the suppression-hearing transcript, we believe Mitchell had\n\na similar motive for developing the women\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing and at trial,\n\nnamely to challenge their eyewitness identification of him as the perpetrator\u2014the only real\n\nissue in the case. Compare State v. White, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20324, 2005-Ohio-212,\n\n\u00b6 26 (\u201cWith respect to the admission at trial of Hurlburt\u2019s former testimony at the suppression\n\nhearing pursuant to Evid.R. 804(B)(1), we conclude that Defendant had a similar \u2018motive\u2019 for\n\ndeveloping Hurlburt\u2019s testimony at the suppression hearing as would exist at trial, which was\n\n\n           2\n             In any event, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause has been interpreted as containing a similar requirement for\n meaningful cross examination. See, e.g., State v. Mills, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21146, 2005-Ohio-2128, \u00b6 26 (\u201cIt is the opportunity to\n meaningfully test and develop by direct and cross-examination the witness\u2019 testimony at the prior proceeding where the witness is under oath\n that provides the indicia of trustworthiness and reliability that satisfies the confrontation clause.\u201d).\n\f                                                                                             \uf02d11\uf02d\n\n\nto question the reliability of Hurlburt\u2019s identification of Defendant as his attacker, as the\n\nidentity of the perpetrator was the central issue in this case.\u201d). \u201cAn identical motive to develop\n\ntestimony is not required by Evid.R. 804(B)(1), only a similar motive.\u201d Id.\n\n       {\u00b6 21} Mitchell also contends he lacked a meaningful opportunity for cross\n\nexamination at the suppression hearing. Specifically, he suggests that his attorney lacked not\n\njust the motive, but also the opportunity to delve into what Veal and Stewart saw because the\n\nhearing was limited to the suggestiveness of the photo-spread. We disagree.\n\n       {\u00b6 22} Veal and Stewart did not testify about the suggestiveness of the photo-spread\n\nitself. They did provide some testimony, however, about the identification procedure. But they\n\nalso testified about other things, including (1) the fact that they knew Mitchell before the\n\nshooting incident, (2) where they were at the time of the shooting, and (3) what they saw\n\nMitchell do. On cross examination, defense counsel questioned the witnesses regarding their\n\nprior knowledge of Mitchell and their ability to observe the incident. If defense counsel had\n\nother questions to ask about what they saw or the reliability of their identification, he could\n\nhave asked them. On appeal, Mitchell has not identified anything in particular that he believes\n\na \u201cmeaningful\u201d cross examination would have covered that was not asked by his attorney at\n\nthe suppression hearing. Although defense counsel\u2019s questioning was not lengthy, we are\n\npersuaded that a meaningful opportunity for cross examination existed.\n\n       {\u00b6 23} Finally, even if the trial court had erred in allowing the State to use Veal\u2019s and\n\nStewart\u2019s suppression-hearing testimony at trial, we would find the error to be harmless\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. This is so because the evidence of Mitchell\u2019s guilt was\n\noverwhelming. The day after Mitchell sent Shalita Williams threatening messages, he\n\f                                                                                            \uf02d12\uf02d\n\n\nappeared at her door and assaulted her. He then began calling her and threatening to shoot her.\n\nWithin hours, shots were fired into her apartment. With police still at the scene, Mitchell\n\ncalled Williams and threatened to shoot at her again. A surveillance video showed a man\n\nmatching Mitchell\u2019s physical description and clothing firing shots into Williams\u2019s apartment.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Mitchell called Williams from jail, threatening once again to kill her.\n\nEven setting aside the identification testimony from Veal and Stewart, the foregoing evidence\n\noverwhelmingly points to Mitchell\u2019s guilt. Thus, any possible error in the trial court\u2019s\n\nadmission of the suppression-hearing testimony was harmless. Compare White at \u00b6 32. The\n\nsecond assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {\u00b6 24} In his third assignment of error, Mitchell contends the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal on the charges of retaliation and intimidation of a\n\ncrime victim. These charges were based on telephone calls the victim, Shalita Williams,\n\nreceived after Mitchell\u2019s arrest.\n\n       {\u00b6 25} On appeal, Mitchell asserts that the State failed to prove identity because\n\nWilliams never identified his voice on the calls. He further claims the State failed to establish\n\nvenue by proving that the calls were made from the Montgomery County jail.\n\n       {\u00b6 26} \u201cWhen considering a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, the trial court must\n\nconstrue the evidence in a light most favorable to the State and determine whether reasonable\n\nminds could reach different conclusions on whether the evidence proves each element of the\n\noffense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Haggerty, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n24405, 2011-Ohio-6705, \u00b6 19. \u201cA Crim.R. 29 motion challenges the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence. A sufficiency of the evidence argument challenges whether the State has presented\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d13\uf02d\n\n\nadequate evidence on each element of the offense to allow the case to go to the jury or sustain\n\nthe verdict as a matter of law.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20.\n\n        {\u00b6 27} Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the record\n\nsupports reasonable inferences that Mitchell made the calls. Although Williams did not\n\nidentify him by name when testifying about the calls, her testimony left no doubt that Mitchell\n\nwas the \u201che\u201d to whom she was referring. Indeed, the context of her testimony supports no\n\nreasonable inference other than that Mitchell was the caller. (Tr. Vol. I at 148-149). According\n\nto Williams, the calls continued until she reported them. (Id. at 149). Detective Daugherty\n\nacknowledged receiving such a complaint from Williams about Mitchell making threatening\n\ncalls. (Id. at 318). Therefore, the State presented legally sufficient evidence to establish the\n\nidentity of the caller.\n\n        {\u00b6 28} We reach the same conclusion regarding venue. Williams testified that the\n\ncalls were coming from \u201cthe jail.\u201d (Id. at 148). Moreover, detective Daugherty, a Montgomery\n\nCounty sheriff\u2019s deputy, testified about obtaining phone records from \u201cour jail\u201d and \u201cthe\n\nCounty Jail.\u201d (Id. at 318-320). He identified 83 phone calls from \u201cthe jail\u201d to Williams\u2019s cell\n\nphone. (Id. at 324). This testimony was legally sufficient to establish venue in Montgomery\n\nCounty. Accordingly, the third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n        {\u00b6 29} In his fourth assignment of error, Mitchell alleges that he received\n\nconstitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. To prevail on this claim, he must\n\nshow that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance\n\nprejudiced him. Strickland v.

Prejudice exists where \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d14\uf02d\n\n\ndeficient performance, the outcome would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694.\n\n       {\u00b6 30} Mitchell first argues that his attorney provided deficient performance by\n\nfailing to conduct a \u201cvigorous cross examination\u201d of Veal and Stewart, the eyewitnesses\n\nwhose suppression-hearing testimony was used at trial. According to Mitchell, the two women\n\nshould have been cross examined \u201cabout their perceptions of the event and their reliability.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b6 31} Having reviewed the suppression-hearing transcript, however, we note that\n\nboth women were cross examined. On direct examination, Veal and Stewart testified that they\n\nknew Mitchell before the shooting incident. They also testified about picking him out of a\n\nphoto-spread and about being sure he was the shooter. On cross examination, defense counsel\n\ninquired into the witnesses\u2019 prior knowledge of Mitchell and their ability to observe the\n\nshooting incident. Defense counsel also asked questions to determine whether the women had\n\nbeen coached or influenced prior to identifying Mitchell\u2019s picture.\n\n       {\u00b6 32} On appeal, Mitchell fails to identify anything in particular that defense\n\ncounsel should have asked to make the cross examination sufficiently \u201cvigorous.\u201d Based on\n\nour review of the testimony, we fail to see any deficient representation in defense counsel\u2019s\n\nquestioning.\n\n       {\u00b6 33} Mitchell next alleges deficient representation based on his attorney\u2019s failure to\n\nobject to hearsay testimony from detective Jeff Papanak. At trial, Papanak testified that he\n\nresponded to the shooting scene within about one minute. Upon arriving, he spoke to three or\n\nfour females who identified \u201cSlim\u201d as the shooter. (Trial Tr. Vol. I at 212-213). Papanak later\n\ndetermined that \u201cSlim\u201d was defendant Mitchell. (Id.).\n\n       {\u00b6 34} Although Mitchell contends Papanak\u2019s testimony about being told \u201cSlim\u201d was\n\f                                                                                               \uf02d15\uf02d\n\n\nthe shooter was hearsay, defense counsel reasonably could have declined to object on the basis\n\nof Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). The females to whom Papanak spoke included                   Kiera Veal,\n\nMarquasha Stewart, Shalita Williams, and Lashana Crawford. (See, e.g, Tr. Vol. I at 145).\n\nPapanak\u2019s testimony that these women identified \u201cSlim\u201d as the shooter at least arguably met\n\nthe requirements for admissibility under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c). The rule provides that a\n\nstatement is not hearsay if \u201cthe declarant testifies at trial or hearing and is subject to\n\ncross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * one of identification of\n\na person soon after perceiving the person, if the circumstances demonstrate the reliability of\n\nthe prior identification.\u201d\n\n        {\u00b6 35} Here Veal and Stewart testified at a pretrial suppression hearing and identified\n\nMitchell, who they knew as \u201cSlim,\u201d as the person they saw shooting a gun at Williams\u2019s\n\napartment. (Suppression Tr. at 9-11, 18-19). During the hearing, Veal also reaffirmed the\n\ncontent of a police statement she had provided at the scene. In it, Veal stated that she saw\n\n\u201cSlim\u201d run up to a gate, pull out a gun, and start firing. (Id. at 11-12). The two women were\n\nsubject to cross examination about their identification, their statements about \u201cSlim\u201d were\n\nones of identification, and the trial court found the statements sufficiently reliable to allow a\n\nvideo of the suppression hearing to be played as evidence at trial. For purposes of Evid.R.\n\n801(D)(1)(c), it matters not that Veal and Stewart were unavailable to testify at trial. \u201c[A]\n\nprior identification that is found reliable by a trial judge falls outside the hearsay rule if it is\n\nshown that the [victim], either at trial or a hearing, had been or is subject to\n\ncross-examination under oath concerning the identification statement and the [victim]\n\nresponds willingly to questions about the previous identification. If these conditions are met\n\f                                                                                                                                      \uf02d16\uf02d\n\n\nand the judge finds the statement of prior identification reliable, then the statement of the\n\ndeclarant can be admitted at trial through a third person to whom or in whose presence the\n\nidentification was made.\u201d State v.

(See, e.g., Tr. Vol. I at 146,\n\n177-178, 182).4 They were subject to cross examination, their identifications were made soon\n\nafter the event, and the circumstances demonstrated reliability insofar as they knew Mitchell\n\nbeforehand.\n\n         {\u00b6 36} Based on the foregoing analysis, we do not find that defense counsel provided\n\ndeficient representation by failing to lodge a hearsay objection to Papanak\u2019s testimony that the\n\nwitnesses told him that \u201cSlim\u201d (Mitchell) was the shooter. But even assuming, arguendo, that\n\ndefense counsel should have objected, the failure to do so constituted harmless error beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. As we noted in our analysis of the second assignment of error above, the\n\nevidence of Mitchell\u2019s guilt, and his identity by the nickname \u201cSlim,\u201d was overwhelming.\n\n         {\u00b6 37} Mitchell also claims deficient representation based on defense counsel\u2019s\n\nfailure to object to (1) shoe-print testimony from deputy Patrick O\u2019Connell, an evidence\n\ntechnician and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s argument about a \u201cmatching\u201d print.\n\n            3\n            In Boston, the Ohio Supreme Court reasoned that \u201cadmitting a child\u2019s out-of-court identification of the perpetrator under Evid.R.\n 801(D)(1)(c), without the child\u2019s testimony at trial, requires the trial judge to conduct a voir dire examination of the child at which the child,\n under oath, is subject to cross-examination concerning her identification and responds willingly to questions about her identification.\u201d\n (Emphasis added.) Boston at 124. Similarly, although Veal and Stewart did not testify at trial, they did testify under oath, and subject to cross\n examination, at a pretrial suppression hearing where they answered questions concerning their identification of Mitchell.\n            4\n            Although Williams and Crawford were inside the apartment and did not see the shooter, they both provided testimony that\n circumstantially identified Mitchell as the gunman.\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d17\uf02d\n\n\n       {\u00b6 38} At trial, O\u2019Connell testified that he found a couple of \u201cfresh\u201d prints in dirt\n\noutside the victim\u2019s apartment. He took pictures of the prints as well as pictures of the bottom\n\nof Mitchell\u2019s shoe. In closing argument, the prosecutor claimed the print in the dirt matched\n\nthe pattern on Mitchell\u2019s shoe. On appeal, Mitchell contends O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony about the\n\nprint found in the dirt was objectionable because he was not an expert in shoe prints. Mitchell\n\nfurther contends the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was objectionable because the assertion\n\nabout the print in the dirt matching Mitchell\u2019s shoe tread was a mischaracterization.\n\n       {\u00b6 39} Upon review, we find nothing objectionable in the disputed testimony.\n\nO\u2019Connell admitted that he was not a shoe-print expert and that he could not tell the age of the\n\nprint in the dirt. (Id. at 293, 295). He explained that the print he photographed appeared to be\n\n\u201cfresh\u201d insofar as it was well-defined and did not appear to be covered with dust or lose dirt.\n\n(Id.). In our view, any potential weaknesses in O\u2019Connell\u2019s testimony went to its weight rather\n\nthan its admissibility. We also see nothing objectionable about the prosecutor\u2019s statement, in\n\nclosing argument, that the tread pattern on Mitchell\u2019s shoe \u201cmatched\u201d the print found in the\n\ndirt. (Id. at 357). The claim constituted permissible argument with which the jury was free to\n\nagree or disagree based on its own interpretation of the evidence.\n\n       {\u00b6 40} Finally, Mitchell claims deficient representation based on defense counsel\u2019s\n\nconcession that Veal and Stewart were unavailable to testify at trial. As noted above, defense\n\ncounsel objected to the State\u2019s use of the two witnesses\u2019 suppression-hearing testimony only\n\non the basis that he lacked an opportunity for meaningful cross examination. Defense counsel\n\ndid not claim unavailability could not be established. Defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge\n\nthe witnesses\u2019 unavailability necessarily did not constitute deficient representation, however,\n\f                                                                                           \uf02d18\uf02d\n\n\nin light of our conclusion above that the trial court correctly declared them unavailable.\n\nFailure to raise a meritless argument will not support an ineffective-assistance claim.
