The Commission denied GTE's request based on GTE's election to be\r\ngoverned by the rate-freeze provisions of Subtitle H of PURA 95.  <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> \u00a7\u00a7 3.351-.359.  The\r\ndistrict court affirmed the Commission's order.  On appeal, GTE challenges the Commission's\r\ndecision, claiming that the Commission erroneously applied the Subtitle H rate-freeze provision\r\nto GTE's request to increase its 1996 franchise tax \"pass-through.\"  We will affirm.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</strong>\tThis case concerns the relationship between Subtitle H of PURA 95, and PURA\r\n95 section 3.211(i).  To fully understand the issues presented in this case, we will first discuss the\r\nstatutes in question in some detail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>PURA 95 Section 3.211(i)</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>In 1991, the Texas Legislature passed House Bill 11 (\"H.B. 11\"), a comprehensive\r\ntax bill that increased franchise and other taxes for most corporations.<sup> (3)</sup>  At the same time, the\r\nLegislature amended the predecessor of PURA 95 to permit a <em>temporary</em> adjustment to the billings\r\nof a public utility to account for the effects of H.B. 11 on the utility's state franchise tax liability. \r\n<em>See </em>PURA 95 \u00a7 3.211(i).<sup> (4)</sup>  This temporary adjustment provides a mechanism for a utility, like\r\nGTE, to recover its increased franchise tax costs, until such costs can be incorporated into the\r\nutility's rates in the utility's next full-blown rate case.   Specifically, PURA 95 section 3.211(i)\r\nprovides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The commission on its own motion or on the petition of a utility shall provide for\r\nthe adjustment of a utility's billing to reflect any increase or decrease of tax\r\nliability of the utility to the state resulting from [H.B. 11] and that is attributable\r\nto activities that are subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.  Any adjustment\r\nto billings under this section must be apportioned prorata to all types and classes\r\nof service provided by the utility and is effective only until the commission alters\r\nthe adjustment as provided by this subsection or enters an order for the utility\r\nunder this section or Section [3.210] of this Act.  The adjustment of billings must\r\nbe made effective at the same time as the increase or decrease of tax liability\r\nresulting from [H.B. 11] or as soon after as is reasonably practical.  Each year\r\nafter any original adjustment, the commission shall review the utility's increase or\r\ndecrease of tax liability resulting from [H.B. 11] and alter the adjustment to reflect\r\nthe increase or decrease.  A proceeding under this subsection is not a rate case\r\nunder this section. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>PURA 95 \u00a7 3.211.  Thus, this provision allows the utility to temporarily \"pass-through\" to its\r\ncustomer-ratepayers the increase in its state franchise tax liability until the utility's next rate case. \r\nFurthermore, it anticipates that the Commission will review and alter the adjustment to reflect\r\nadditional increases or decreases in H.B. 11 tax liability each year following the original\r\nadjustment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn January 1992, the Commission adopted a rule implementing PURA 95\r\n\u00a7\u00a03.211(i).  <em>See </em>17 Tex. Reg. 110 (1992).  That rule specifies the mechanism by which a utility\r\nmay <em>temporarily</em> \"pass-through\" the effect of H.B. 11 on its state franchise tax liability to its\r\ncustomers until its next rate case.  <em>See </em>16 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 23.21(e) (West 1997) (\"Rule\r\n23.21(e)\").  Rule 23.21(e) directs all utilities that are eligible for the \"pass-through\" to file, in\r\nDecember of each year, a tariff setting forth an \"interim\" H.B. 11 tax adjustment factor for the\r\nnext calendar year.  <em>See id.</em> \u00a7 23.21(e)(1),(3).  Moreover, the rule requires that the adjustment\r\nfactor be stated as a percentage of the customer's bill.  <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 23.21(e)(6)(B).  Finally, the rule\r\nprescribes that the proposed \"interim\" factor be subject to an annual \"true-up\" or adjustment filed\r\non or before March 1 of the year following the year that the \"interim\" factor was in effect. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>Subtitle H of PURA 95</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFour years after the enactment of H.B. 11, Subtitle H was added to PURA 95. \r\nSubtitle H was enacted to \"provide a framework for an orderly transition from traditional return-on-invested-capital regulation to a fully competitive telecommunications marketplace where all\r\ntelecommunications providers compete on fair terms.\"  PURA 95<em> </em>\u00a7 3.351.  Under Subtitle H, an\r\nincumbent local exchange company (\"ILEC\"),<sup> (5)</sup> like GTE, may voluntarily opt out of traditional\r\ncost-of-service rate regulation under Subtitle E of PURA 95 by notifying the Commission of its\r\nelection to be regulated under Subtitle H.  <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3.352(a).  Subtitle H specifies that the notice\r\nof election must state the company's commitment to freeze any increase in the rates charged for\r\ncovered services for a four-year period.  <em>Id.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPURA 95 directs that the services provided by an ILEC, electing Subtitle H\r\nregulation, be classified into three categories or \"baskets,\" each including a variety of services. \r\nBasket I (basic network) lists fifteen services;<sup> (6)</sup> Basket II (discretionary) lists eight services;<sup> (7)</sup> and\r\nBasket III (competitive) lists nine services.<sup> (8)</sup>  <em>Id.</em> \u00a7\u00a7 3.352(b)(1), .353, .355, .356.  With limited\r\nexceptions not relevant to this case, an ILEC electing Subtitle H incentive regulation is prohibited\r\nfrom increasing rates for Basket I (basic network) services for four years following its election. \r\n<em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3.353(b).  The Subtitle H company may, however, change its rates for Basket II\r\n(discretionary) and Basket III (competitive) services largely without any regulatory oversight by\r\nthe Commission.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong>The Controversy</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPursuant to PURA 95 section 3.211(i), GTE filed for, and received, a franchise tax\r\nadjustment to its billing for the 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 tax years.  On September 20, 1995,\r\nGTE, pursuant to PURA 95 section 3.352, notified the Commission that it voluntarily elected to\r\nbe subject to Subtitle H incentive regulation.  GTE's letter notifying the Commission of its\r\nelection states, in part:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>This is to notify the Commission that pursuant to Section 3.352 of the Public\r\nUtility Regulatory Act of 1995 (\"Act\"), GTE Southwest Incorporated\r\n(\"Company\") hereby elects to be regulated under the provisions of Subtitle H of\r\nthe Act, Incentive Regulation of Telecommunications.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The Company commits to limit any increase in the rates charged for services in\r\nSection 3.353 of the Act for a four-year period . . . .  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThereafter, on December 1, 1995, GTE filed an application requesting an <em>increase</em>\r\nin its interim H.B. 11 franchise tax adjustment factor from its 1995 level of .001759 to .002117\r\nfor 1996.<sup> (9)</sup>  On April 15, 1996, a Commission Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") denied GTE's\r\nrequest for an <em>increase</em> to its H.B. 11 tax adjustment factor as contrary to its commitment to freeze\r\nrates for Basket I (basic network) services.  The ALJ, however, granted interim approval of\r\nGTE's request for a change in its H.B. 11 tax adjustment factor for its Basket II (discretionary)\r\nand Basket III (competitive) services.  The ALJ therefore directed GTE to \"file the necessary\r\ntariffs to effectuate this ruling on or before May 1, 1996.\"  GTE refused to file the increased\r\nadjustment factor on Basket II and Basket III services stating that the computation \"would be\r\nextremely burdensome if not impossible.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn January 15, 1997, the Commission issued a final order denying GTE's\r\napplication for an increase to its H.B. 11 tax adjustment factor relating to Basket I services.  The\r\nOrder also denied GTE's request for an increase to its H.B. 11 tax adjustment factor for its Basket\r\nII (discretionary) and Basket III (competitive) services for a failure to prosecute such requests. \r\nThe district court affirmed the Commission's Order.  GTE now appeals to this Court the district\r\ncourt's judgment and the Commission's order denying its request to increase its 1996 franchise\r\ntax adjustment factor pursuant to PURA 95 section 3.211(i).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn two points of error, GTE primarily contends that the Subtitle H rate-freeze\r\nprovision was erroneously applied to its request to increase its 1996 franchise tax adjustment\r\nfactor pursuant to PURA 95 section 3.211(i).  Specifically, GTE argues as follows: the rate-freeze\r\nprovision applies <em>only</em> to the fifteen services listed as a Basket I (basic network) service; the H.B.\r\n11 tax adjustment factor is not among that list of Basket I services; therefore, the rate-freeze\r\nprovision is not applicable to its request to increase its 1996 tax adjustment factor pursuant to\r\nsection 3.211(i). <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>GTE misconstrues its obligation under Subtitle H of PURA 95.  PURA 95 sections\r\n3.352(a) and 3.353(b) clearly state that upon election of Subtitle H, GTE <em>commits</em> itself \"to limit\r\n<em>any</em> increase\" \"in rates for basic network services\" \"for a four year period\" of time.  PURA 95\r\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a03.352(a), .353(b).  Given this commitment by GTE, we hold that an increase in GTE's\r\nfranchise tax adjustment would be contrary to GTE's promise and election under Subtitle H. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tPURA 95 section 3.211(i) prescribes that \"[a]ny adjustment to billings under\r\n[section<strong> </strong>3.211(i)] <em>must be apportioned prorata to all types and classes of service provided by the\r\nutility. . . .\" </em> <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3.211(i).  Because this provision requires a prorata increase to \"all types\" of\r\nservice, GTE faces the impossible task of keeping its rates for Basket I services at the status quo\r\nas prescribed by Subtitle H.  <em>See id.</em> \u00a7\u00a7 3.352(a), .353(b).<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>Despite this provision of PURA, the dissent argues that GTE's requested franchise\r\ntax adjustment-increase does not constitute a <em>rate increase</em>, but rather is merely an automatic pass-through or adjustment.  This Court has addressed and rejected a similar argument offered by the\r\ndissent in two previous cases.  <em>See</em> <em>Southwestern Public Serv. Co. v. Public Util.

App.--Austin 1993, writ denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t In <em>Southwestern Bell,</em> we were asked to determine whether a rate-freeze provision\r\ncontained<strong> </strong>in a non-unanimous settlement stipulation (\"NUS\") agreed to by Southwestern Bell\r\n<em>before</em> the enactment of H.B. 11 and section 3.211(i) prohibited Southwestern Bell from seeking\r\na franchise tax adjustment pursuant to the predecessor of section 3.211(i).<strong><em>  </em></strong></span><span><em>See Southwestern Bell\r\nTel. Co.</em>, 863 S.W.2d at 755-57<em>.</em>  The NUS, which Southwestern Bell entered into voluntarily\r\nstipulated in part:<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Southwestern Bell agrees. . . . <em>not to propose any increase</em> in its local exchange,\r\nService Connection Charges, Direct Inward Dialing (DID), Direct Outward\r\nDialing (DOD), toll (MTS), WATS, 800 Service, Touch-tone, or Access Service\r\ntariff rates for four years from the date of Commission approval.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><strong><em></em></strong></span><span><em>See id. </em>at 758.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining whether this agreement prohibited Southwestern Bell from seeking\r\nan H.B. 11 franchise tax adjustment, we examined whether \"the <em>effect</em> of the tax pass-through\r\nresulted in an increase in <em>tariff rates</em> to Southwestern Bell's Customers\" in violation of\r\nSouthwestern Bell's rate-freeze agreement.  <em>Id. </em>at 758.  We concluded that it did.  <em>Id</em>.  Such an\r\nanalysis is persuasive under the facts of this case.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs stated above, PURA 95 section 3.211(i) requires the adjustment to be\r\napportioned <em>prorata</em> to all types and classes of services.  Thus, an H.B. 11 tax adjustment\r\n<em>effectively increases</em> the rates for Basket I services.  Therefore, just as we held that the\r\nCommission properly prohibited Southwestern Bell from adjusting its franchise tax rates as\r\ncontrary to its NUS, we sustain the Commission's action in refusing to allow GTE to \"effectively\"\r\nincrease rates on Basket I services in violation of its Subtitle H election<strong>. </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>Moreover, we believe that the facts of this case are even more compelling to\r\nprohibit a franchise tax adjustment-increase than the circumstances that were present in\r\n<em>Southwestern Bell</em>.  Southwestern Bell, unlike GTE, entered into the NUS <em>prior</em> to the enactment\r\nof H.B. 11 and the franchise tax adjustment provision.  Therefore, Southwestern Bell was able\r\nto argue that equitably it should not be deprived of a legislative tax adjustment provision that it\r\nhad no knowledge of at the time it entered into its rate-freeze agreement.  By contrast, in the\r\npresent case, we are presented with a situation where GTE: (1) knew of the franchise tax\r\nadjustment provision and had, in fact, taken advantage of it the previous four years; (2) knew of\r\nthe Commission's explicit commentary suggesting the potential loss of the franchise tax\r\nadjustment-increase as a direct consequence of entering into a rate-freeze agreement<strong>;</strong><sup> (10)</sup></span><span><strong> </strong>and (3)\r\nknew of our decision in <em>Southwestern Bell </em>affirming the Commission's refusal to allow a franchise\r\ntax adjustment if the utility had agreed to freeze rates.<em>  </em>Armed with this knowledge, GTE\r\nvoluntarily elected to embrace the incentive regulation provisions of Subtitle H.  Thus, while these\r\nprovisions contain significant benefits for GTE, it is likewise bound to uphold its obligation to\r\nfreeze rates for Basket I services even if this means the forfeiture of an increase in its franchise\r\ntax adjustment</span><span>.<strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>Finally, in a more recent opinion,<em> </em>we implicitly rejected the exact argument offered\r\nby the dissent that a pass-through or an adjustment does not constitute a rate.  <em>See</em> <em>Southwestern\r\nPublic Serv. Co</em>, 962 S.W.2d at 218.  In <em>Southwestern</em>, we were asked to determine,<em> inter alia,</em>\r\nwhether a fuel reconciliation proceeding constituted a ratemaking proceeding.  <em>Id.  </em>A fuel\r\nreconciliation proceeding allows a utility company to reconcile its fuel expenses when its\r\npredetermined customer rates result in either over or under recovery for fuel expenses.  Based on\r\nwhether there is an over or under recovery for fuel expenses, the utility must impose either a\r\nsurcharge or refund on a customer's bill.<em>  See id. </em>at 210. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tImportant to this appeal was Southwestern's argument that the fuel reconciliation\r\nadjustment did not constitute a ratemaking proceeding because the <em>adjustment</em> to the customer's\r\nbill was not a <em>rate</em>.  <em>See id.</em> at 218.  In rejecting this argument, we stated that a \"rate\" includes\r\n\"every compensation . . . charged, or collected whether directly or indirectly by any public utility\r\nfor any [service] . . .\" <em>see id</em>.; PURA 95 \u00a71.003.  We held that any proceeding resulting in an\r\nincrease in compensation to the utility via its customers is, broadly speaking, a ratemaking\r\nproceeding.  <em>Id</em>.  This rationale is instructive in the present cause.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe franchise tax adjustment-increase in the instant cause is analogous to the\r\nadjustment in a fuel reconciliation proceeding.  They are both \"adjustments\" to the customer's\r\nutility bill that are done outside of a full-blown rate case.  GTE cannot escape our holding in\r\n<em>Southwestern</em> that through its prorata application, a franchise tax adjustment-increase imposes a\r\nprohibited \"rate\" increase on GTE's customers for Basket I services.  As in <em>Southwestern,</em> we\r\nnote that a rate also includes every <em>tariff</em> charged by a utility for its service.  PURA 95 \u00a7 1.003. \r\nIt is undisputed that the franchise tax adjustment-increase is a \"tariff . . . charged\" by GTE. \r\nTherefore, because the requested franchise tax adjustment-increase does increase overall <em>rates</em> for\r\nBasket I services as prohibited by Subtitle H, we hold that the Commission did not err in refusing\r\nGTE's request to increase its franchise tax adjustment.  We overrule GTE's points of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>Having overruled GTE's points of<strong> </strong>error, we affirm the Commission's order and\r\nthe district court's judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t<span>                                                                       \r\n \t\t\t\t\t</span>Mack Kidd, Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Before Justices Powers, Kidd and B.

In 1997, the\r\nLegislature adopted the Texas Utilities Code and codified the provisions of PURA 95.  <em>See </em>Act\r\nof May 8, 1997, 75th Leg., R.S., ch. 166, \u00a7 10, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 713, 1018. This\r\ncodification, however was non-substantive.  Therefore, for the sake of consistency with the briefs\r\nfiled in this appeal, we will cite to the provisions in effect immediately prior to codification.\r\n</p><p>3.         Act of Aug. 22, 1991, 72d Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 5, 1991 Tex. Gen. Laws 134.  \r\n</p><p>4.         The predecessor of PURA 95 contained an almost identical provision to section 3.211(i) \r\n<em>See </em>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1446c, \u00a7 43(j) (West Supp. 1993).  For the sake of simplicity\r\nwe will only refer to PURA 95 section 3.211(i).   \r\n</p><p>5.         An \"incumbent local exchange company\" is a telecommunications utility that held as of\r\nSeptember 1, 1995, a certificate of convenience and necessity to provide local exchange telephone\r\nservice, basic local telecommunications service, or switched access service within the state. <em> See\r\n</em>PURA 95 \u00a7 3.002(3), (5).  GTE is such a company.\r\n</p><p>6.         The following services are Basket I (basic network) services:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(1) flat rate residential and business local exchange telephone service, including\r\nprimary directory listings and the receipt of a directory and any applicable mileage\r\nor zone charges;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(2) tone dialing service;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(3) lifeline and tel-assistance service;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(4) service connection for basic services;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(5) direct inward dialing service for basic services;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(6) private pay telephone access service;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(7) call trap and trace service;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(8) access to 911 service provided by a local authority and access to dual party relay\r\nservice;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(9) switched access service;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(10) interconnection to competitive providers;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(11) mandatory extended area service arrangements;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(12) mandatory extended metropolitan service or other mandatory toll-free calling\r\narrangements;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(13) interconnection for commercial mobile service providers;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(14) directory assistance; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(15) \"1-plus\" intraLATA message toll service. \r\n<p>7.         The following services are discretionary services:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(1) \"1-plus\" intraLATA message toll services, if intraLATA equal access is\r\navailable;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(2) 0+ and 0- operator services;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(3) call waiting, call forwarding, and custom calling features that are not classified\r\nas a competitive service under Section 58.151;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(4) call return, caller identification, and call control options that are not classified as\r\na competitive service under Section 58.151;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(5) central office based PBX-type services;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(6) billing and collection services;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(7) integrated services digital network (ISDN) services; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(8) new services\r\n<p>8.         The following services are classified as competitive services:</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t(1) services described in the WATS tariff as the tariff existed on January 1, 1995;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(2) 800 and foreign exchange services;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(3) private line service;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(4) special access service;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(5) services from public pay telephones;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(6) paging services and mobile services (IMTS);</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(7) 911 premises equipment;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(8) speed dialing; and</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(9) three-way calling. \r\n<p>9.         The H.B. 11 surcharge factor is simply a percentage factor by which the rates for\r\ntelecommunications services, including Basket I services, are increased to recover cost-of-service\r\nincreases in franchise taxes.  For example, in 1995, GTE's surcharge factor was .001759.  This\r\nmeans that if a customer purchased only Basket I services, that customer did not pay the tariff\r\nrates for those Basket I services; instead, the customer paid 1.001759 times those tariff rates.  For\r\n1996, GTE requested an <em>increase</em> in the surcharge factor to .002117.  If the Commission had\r\ngranted this request, then the total charges paid by the customer-ratepayers for Basket I services\r\nwould have increased.  By increasing the amount of money paid by customer-ratepayers for Basket\r\nI services, the increases to the surcharge have the effect of increasing the rates for those services. \r\nThis is expressly forbidden by Subtitle H.\r\n</p><p>10.        GTE, unlike Southwestern Bell, was privy to the following commentary by the Commission\r\nregarding the effects of a rate-freeze agreement on implementing section 3.211(i):</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span><em>If a utility has agreed to a rate-freeze or similar restriction</em>, the parties agreeing to\r\nthe stipulation have already in some manner allocated the risk of changing tax laws. \r\n<em>The utility has accepted the risk of increasing taxes</em>; the signing ratepayers have\r\naccepted the risk of decreasing taxes.  In deference to standard means of changing\r\nrates and the agreement of the parties, the commission should not by rule move to\r\nadjust the utility's bills to decrease rates.  Likewise, the commission assumes that the\r\nutilities will be willing to honor their previous agreements.  The language [of the\r\nrule] has been changed so that utilities that have an agreement concerning changes\r\nin cost of service will not be required to implement the change.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>17 Tex.
