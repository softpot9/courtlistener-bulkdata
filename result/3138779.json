Murphy,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Judge Presiding.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>PRESIDING JUSTICE CAHILL delivered the opinion of the court:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner appeals the trial court's denial of his motion to expunge his arrest record. \u00a0We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>We address the following issue: when addressing a petition to expunge an arrest record, to what extent, if at all, may a court consider the petitioner's behavior after he is released without being convicted or after he has completed supervision. \u00a0We conclude that a trial judge may consider relevant postdisposition behavior. \u00a0We also conclude that postdisposition behavior must be relevant to the charges for which the petitioner seeks expungement. \u00a0\t</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner's then wife, Sarah Chesler, filed a petition for dissolution of marriage in December 1987. \u00a0She alleged mental and physical cruelty and sought sole custody of their twin daughters. \u00a0A dissolution of marriage was entered on October 15, 1990, and Sarah was granted custody of their daughters. \u00a0Sarah made allegations against petitioner in the course of the dissolution proceedings that led to the arrest records petitioner now seeks to expunge. \u00a0\t</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner was first arrested on November 27, 1987, and charged with assault. \u00a0Petitioner was later charged with separate counts of simple battery on December 19, 1987, January 20, 1988, and January 26, 1988. \u00a0Petitioner was charged with battery again on March 29, 1988. \u00a0Sarah was the complaining witness in each case. \u00a0Petitioner was found not guilty of these charges in a bench trial on June 28, 1988. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner was again arrested on March 11, 1988, and charged with battery of Sarah. \u00a0Petitioner was also charged with violating an order of protection obtained by Sarah. \u00a0Petitioner was found guilty of these charges and sentenced to two months' supervision. \u00a0Petitioner successfully completed supervision on July 31, 1989. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>In an incident unrelated to the dissolution of marriage, petitioner was charged with retail theft in Cook County on August 31, 1991. \u00a0This case was dismissed after petitioner completed a theft deterrent program on November 9, 1991. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner was charged with retail theft in DuPage County on January 27, 1992. \u00a0Petitioner was found guilty and given one year of supervision. \u00a0Petitioner later filed a </span>\n<span>petition to expunge his DuPage County arrest record. \u00a0Expungement was granted on June 8, 1998. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner filed a motion to expunge his Cook County arrest records on January 14, 1997. \u00a0He alleged that he was arrested for the offenses stated, that he was released without being convicted, and that he had not been arrested or convicted of a criminal or municipal offense since 1992. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The State objected, arguing that petitioner's subsequent conduct should be considered, given the current state of his relationship with his two daughters. \u00a0At a hearing on the petition, Sarah testified, over objection, about events that happened after, but were allegedly related to, petitioner's Cook County arrests. \u00a0Petitioner's daughters did not testify.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Sarah testified that, in the summer of 1991, petitioner went on a cross-country trip with his daughters. \u00a0Sarah said that her daughters told her that, during the trip, petitioner became angry twice, left the girls alone and drove away. \u00a0The first incident was in Yellowstone Park, where petitioner left the girls alone in a closed visitor's center. \u00a0In a second incident, petitioner left one of the girls at the side of a road in Arizona. \u00a0Petitioner's continuing hearsay objections to this testimony were overruled. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Sarah then testified that, except for a brief visit with petitioner in 1992, the girls have not seen and do not wish to see petitioner. \u00a0Sarah said that the 1991 trip with petitioner so \"deeply affected\" the girls that they needed counseling. \u00a0Sarah mentioned two letters petitioner sent to his daughters in 1992 and 1993. \u00a0The letters are described as demanding and dictatorial. \u00a0Sarah testified that petitioner made certain demands of her daughters in these letters, but she did not elaborate. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Sarah then testified about mail she and her neighbors received in New York. \u00a0Sarah said that packages containing newspaper clippings about the charges against petitioner and a letter addressed to a New York newspaper were mailed to or dropped off with friends and Sarah's business associates in 1988 and 1989. \u00a0Sarah identified the handwriting on one of the envelopes and newspaper clippings as that of petitioner. \u00a0None of the packages are part of the record on appeal. \u00a0On cross-examination, Sarah admitted that she did not cooperate with petitioner's visitation rights, causing him to file emergency petitions to enforce his rights. \u00a0Sarah said that her children were fearful of petitioner and she intervened to protect them. \u00a0But Sarah admitted that the judge in the dissolution proceeding did not find the children were fearful of petitioner. \u00a0Sarah also admitted that, after the incidents on the 1991 trip, she did not file a police report or charges with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. \u00a0She did file a report with a New York agency one year later, but after an investigation that agency found the charges unfounded. \u00a0Sarah also said that the judge who found petitioner not guilty of five of the battery charges had \"made a mistake.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner testified that after Sarah filed for divorce in December 1987, she filed criminal charges against him in 1988. \u00a0Petitioner denied mailing the packages to Sarah or anyone else in New York. \u00a0Petitioner said that he was not in New York in 1988 or 1989, when the packages were sent. \u00a0Petitioner admitted writing the two letters to his daughters. \u00a0Petitioner explained that the letters were \"harsh\" because Sarah continuously blocked his repeated attempts to see his children. \u00a0Petitioner said that his children do not want to see him because they are afraid of their mother, not him. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner denied abandoning his daughters during the 1991 trip. \u00a0He said that the girls were scared because the trip was physically demanding, involving off-trail backpacking, canoeing and hiking. \u00a0Petitioner said that his relationship with his daughters was very close.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The court then addressed the retail theft charge, noting that no evidence was presented on that charge. \u00a0The State said it had no objection to expungement of that charge. \u00a0The court then expunged the retail theft charge. \u00a0The court later vacated this order of expungement on June 25, 1997, </span>\n<span>sua sponte</span>\n<span>. \u00a0Final argument on petitioner's petition was heard on November 18, 1997. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The court entered an order on February 13, 1998, denying in its entirety his petition to expunge. \u00a0The court found that petitioner had not shown good cause to have his record expunged, citing to </span>\n<span>People v. Hansen</span>\n<span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></span> (1990). \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner raises five issues on appeal: (1) the court created a new standard for \"good cause shown\" by misapplying </span>\n<span>People v. Hansen</span>\n<span>; (2) the evidence he presented at the hearing was enough to allow expungement; (3) the court abused its discretion in denying expungement of the retail theft charge where no evidence was presented and the State did not object to expungement of that charge; (4) the State missed the 30-day deadline to object to his petition; and (5) the trial judge was biased against petitioner. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner contends that postarrest and postdisposition behavior is irrelevant in the expungement context. \u00a0Petitioner focuses on section 5(a) of the Criminal Identification Act, which permits expungement \"upon good cause shown.\" \u00a020 ILCS 2630/5(a) (West 1996). \u00a0Petitioner contends that the \u201cgood cause shown\u201d element requires only that a petitioner meet the statutory criteria for expungement. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Section 5(a) allows a petitioner to petition for expungement if there are no current or earlier convictions and petitioner was released without being convicted or completed supervision. \u00a020 ILCS 2630/5(a) (West 1996). \u00a0Cases resolved by supervision require a two-year waiting period before expungement may be sought. Supervision for other offenses not relevant here require a five-year waiting period. \u00a020 ILCS 2630/5(a) (West 1996). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner reasons that, since he met the statutory requirements, he met the \"good cause shown\" criterion and is entitled to expungement. \u00a0Petitioner claims that the court changed the \"good cause shown\" standard and abused its discretion by interpreting </span>\n<span>People v. Hansen</span>\n<span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></span> (1990), as authority to consider postarrest and postdisposition behavior. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner\u2019s argument assumes that satisfaction of the statutory criteria entitles him to expungement as of right. \u00a0We believe the plain language of the statute contradicts this argument. \u00a0Section 5(d) of the Criminal Identification Act gives the court the discretion to grant or deny an expungement petition. \u00a020 ILCS 2630/5(d) (West 1996). \u00a0This permissive language shows \u00a0that the statutory criteria establish eligibility for, rather than entitlement to, expungement.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>We read section 5(a) as creating two categories of expungeable charges--where the petitioner is found not guilty and where the \u00a0petitioner is placed on supervision. \u00a0We believe the statute's two-</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>year (and sometimes five-year) waiting period for expungement of charges disposed of by supervision is a legislative recognition that postdisposition behavior is a relevant, if not mandatory, consideration. \u00a0There would be no point to a waiting period if this were not so. \u00a0This leaves us with the question of the relevance of postdisposition behavior in deciding whether to expunge a record where the petitioner was found not guilty, where no waiting period is mandated.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>We first note that petitioner's not-guilty findings do not mean he is innocent of the battery charges. \u00a0A not-guilty verdict expresses no view on a defendant's innocence, but reflects the prosecution's failure to meet its burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00a0</span>\n<span>People v. Smith</span>\n<span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098487\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098487/people-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 545, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2098487\"><a href=\"/opinion/2098487/people-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span> (1999). </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The trial court here appeared to rely on a comment made by the trial court in </span>\n<span>Hansen</span>\n<span>: \"that defendant's 'indiscretion' appeared to be out of character with his current mode of behavior.\" \u00a0</span>\n<span>Hansen</span>\n<span>, 198 Ill. App. 3d at 167. \u00a0A fair reading of this remark would lead to the conclusion that the trial court in </span>\n<span>Hansen</span>\n<span> considered the petitioner's postdisposition good behavior. \u00a0After citing to </span>\n<span>Hansen</span>\n<span>, the trial judge in this case said the record here exhibited a pattern of conduct that did \"not appear to be indiscretions or out of [petitioner's] character,\" and did not outweigh the public's right to safety. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Our reading of that remark leads us to conclude that the trial judge reasoned that if good behavior is relevant in an expungement context, bad behavior is equally relevant. \u00a0We agree, but we do not rely on </span>\n<span>Hansen</span>\n<span>, where the trial judge's remark was ultimately irrelevant to the disposition of the case. \u00a0We choose instead to rely on the language of the statute itself and </span>\n<span>People v.

App. 3d at 409. \u00a0The factors include: the strength of the State's case against the petitioner; the State's reasons for wishing to retain the records; the petitioner's age, criminal record and employment history; the length of time between the arrest and the expungement petition; and the adverse consequences the petitioner may suffer if expungement is not granted. \u00a0</span>\n<span>This list is not exhaustive and each case should be decided on its own merits. \u00a0</span>\n<span>W.P</span>\n<span>., 417 Pa.

App. 3d at 167. \u00a0</span>\n<span>(Emphasis added.) \u00a0\u00a0In context, the remark was </span>\n<span>dictum </span>\n<span>at most, but it is</span>\n<span> dictum </span>\n<span>that comports with the statute and </span>\n<span>Wells</span>\n<span>. \u00a0</span>\n<span> </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Reading </span>\n<span>Hansen</span>\n<span> and </span>\n<span>Wells</span>\n<span> together, we believe that postdisposition behavior may be relevant in deciding to grant an arrest expungement even where the petitioner was found not guilty. \u00a0\u00a0We believe that in some cases, but not all, postdisposition behavior related to pre-disposition behavior should be considered. \u00a0The court in this case acted within its discretion in considering evidence beyond the statutory eligibility requirements. \u00a0The trial judge was faced with a set of facts that could lead her to conclude that the petitioner's alleged behavior arising out of his domestic relationship continued after the dissolution and was reflected in his behavior toward his daughters. \u00a0Although he was found not guilty of assault and four counts of battery between November 1987 and March 1988, he was found guilty of a separate charge of battery and of violating an order of protection in the same time frame. \u00a0In evaluating the arrest history in the light of the subsequent allegations of child abuse, the trial court may well have concluded that the State's reasons for retaining the records bore a rational relationship to its duty to consider the best interests of the petitioner's daughters. \u00a0Given the broad discretion invested in the trial court under the statute and </span>\n<span>Wells</span>\n<span>, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion. \u00a0</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Petitioner next argues that even if the court applied the correct standard, there was enough evidence to support expungement. \u00a0Petitioner then sets out the three reasons he says the court relied on to deny his petition and claims that none are supported by the record.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>First, petitioner complains that the evidence does not support the court\u2019s finding that petitioner\u2019s conduct exhibits a pattern of abusive behavior. \u00a0Petitioner states that this finding is based solely on Sarah\u2019s testimony about petitioner\u2019s conduct after his criminal trials. \u00a0Petitioner claims that the record shows this testimony was discredited. \u00a0Petitioner also emphasizes that the State did not present testimony about petitioner\u2019s current behavior. \u00a0The only testimony presented addressed petitioner\u2019s conduct in 1992. \u00a0The argument stresses the inconsistencies in and credibility of Sarah\u2019s testimony and the absence of testimony about petitioner\u2019s conduct since 1992. \u00a0But issues of credibility and resolving conflicting evidence are left to the trier of fact. \u00a0</span>\n<span>People v.
