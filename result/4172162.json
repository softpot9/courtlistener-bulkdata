We will affirm.\n\n\n*\n This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not\nconstitute binding precedent.\n\f       Robredo was involved with two transactions with Metro Honda\u2014a 2009\n\ninstallment agreement for the purchase of a 2006 Honda CR-V, and a 2010 agreement for\n\nthe lease of a 2010 Honda CR-V. She believed that Metro Honda had engaged in\n\nfraudulent and deceptive sales practices in those transactions and brought suit in New\n\nJersey state court. On the basis of arbitration clauses in the two agreements with Metro\n\nHonda that Robredo had signed, the New Jersey Superior Court dismissed her complaint\n\nand compelled her to engage in binding arbitration with Metro Honda.\n\n       Robredo was represented by counsel in the arbitration of the dispute, which the\n\nparties settled. Robredo then contested the settlement and won the right to pursue a\n\nsecond arbitration, this time proceeding pro se. The arbitrator in the second case\n\nconcluded that Robredo\u2019s claims had no merit, and denied Metro Honda\u2019s counterclaims\n\nfor fees and costs.\n\n       Eleven months after the arbitrator issued the award, Robredo sued Metro Honda in\n\nthe District Court, bringing substantially the same cause of action but also invoking\n\nvarious federal statutes. Metro Honda moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction, on res judicata grounds, and as untimely filed under the applicable\n\nstatutes of limitations. Metro Honda acknowledged that its motion referred to matters\n\noutside of the pleadings and might, accordingly, have to be considered in the alternative\n\nas a motion for summary judgment. After Robredo responded to the motion, the District\n\nCourt granted summary judgment in favor of Metro Honda. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.

In particular, the parties agreed to arbitrate all\n\nclaims that might arise out of, or would be related to, the automobile transactions\u2014\n\nincluding all state, federal, or statutory claims. The agreement included non-exclusive\n\nexamples of such claims: \u201cConsumer Fraud, Used Car Lemon Law, and Truth-in-\n\nLending claims.\u201d The parties agreed to waive their rights to pursue other remedies in\n\nother forums, including in court. The parties also agreed that the arbitration decision\n\nwould bind them. After Robredo brought suit in state court, the New Jersey Superior\n\nCourt ruled definitively that her suit was subject to arbitration.\n\n       On appeal, Robredo argues that the arbitration proceedings were somehow unfair\n\nor one-sided, but the record does not bear out that assertion. In those proceedings, the\n\nparties had the opportunity to present and rebut evidence to support their legal claims.\n\nRobredo provided both pre-hearing and post-hearing submissions to the arbitrator before\n\na final decision issued, and Robredo herself testified at the hearing. The proceedings then\n                                                3\n\fconcluded when the arbitrator issued a reasoned opinion in December 2014. Robredo\n\nnever appealed that decision to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New\n\nJersey, nor sought to vacate or modify the award within the prescribed period to do so.\n\nSee 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 12 (\u201cNotice of a motion to vacate, modify, or correct an award must be\n\nserved upon the adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed\n\nor delivered.\u201d). Robredo\u2019s contention that the District Court could hear her claims in\n\nfederal court because the arbitration proceedings were somehow unfair or biased\n\ntherefore has no support in the record.1\n\n       For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Metro Honda\u2019s\n\nmotion to summarily affirm is dismissed as moot.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In addition, we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Robredo\u2019s claims were\ntime-barred\u2014an issue that Robredo did not address on appeal in her briefs. Also,\nalthough the parties did not discuss tolling in their briefing, no basis for equitable tolling\nof the statutes of limitations is apparent in the record.\n                                                4\n\f</pre>", "Case_Text": "                                                               NOT PRECEDENTIAL\n\n                       UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                            FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n                                 ___________\n\n                                       No. 16-3317\n                                       ___________\n\n                                  KARINA ROBREDO,\n                                           Appellant\n\n                                             v.\n\n                                    METRO HONDA\n\n                       ____________________________________\n\n                     On Appeal from the United States District Court\n                              for the District of New Jersey\n                         (D.C.
