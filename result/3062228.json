The BIA dismissed his appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ)\n\ndecision denying his request for cancellation of removal. We have jurisdiction under\n\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petition.\n\n\n\n*\n      After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this\nappeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral\nestoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with\nFed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                  BACKGROUND\n\n      Mr. Chairez-Perez is a native and citizen of Mexico. He entered the United\n\nStates illegally in 1992. He and his wife have two United States citizen children.\n\nIn 2008, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against\n\nMr. Chairez-Perez. He conceded removability, but applied for cancellation of\n\nremoval based on exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his United States\n\ncitizen children.\n\n      The IJ held a hearing on the cancellation-of-removal request. During\n\nthe hearing, Mr. Chairez-Perez\u2019s son, Jorge Chairez, began testifying about\n\nconditions in Mexico. The IJ questioned the relevance of this testimony, noting that\n\nMr. Chairez-Perez\u2019s application indicated the children would not return to Mexico if\n\nhe were removed. His counsel responded that they wished to present their case in the\n\nalternative, detailing the hardship that would occur both if the children remained in\n\nthe United States and if they left with their father for Mexico. The IJ denied\n\ncounsel\u2019s request to present an alternative case, ordering him to \u201cmove onto a\n\ndifferent area.\u201d Admin. R. at 189.\n\n      The IJ denied the application for cancellation of removal. He found\n\nMr. Chairez-Perez had failed to establish two of the requisite elements: good moral\n\ncharacter, and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his citizen children.\n\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(B), (D).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      Mr. Chairez-Perez appealed to the BIA. He argued, among other things, the IJ\n\nhad \u201cerred in not allowing all relevant and cogent evidence to establish extreme and\n\nunusual hardship.\u201d Admin. R. at 465. The BIA remanded to the IJ \u201cso that testimony\n\ncan be presented on [Mr. Chairez-Perez\u2019s] alternative theory of exceptional and\n\nextremely unusual hardship[.]\u201d Id. at 457. The BIA instructed that \u201c[o]n remand,\n\nboth parties may present additional evidence relevant to the respondent\u2019s claim.\u201d Id.\n\n      On remand, the IJ said the BIA had remanded solely to permit Mr. Chairez-\n\nPerez to present additional evidence on his alternative hardship theory. Mr.\n\nChairez-Perez disagreed, contending the BIA had granted him \u201ca new trial . . . on all\n\nclaims, [at which to] present our evidence.\u201d Id. at 240. In particular, he wished to\n\npresent additional, updated evidence concerning his good moral character. The IJ\n\nrejected this argument and denied Mr. Chairez-Perez\u2019s request to make an offer of\n\nproof on good moral character. Mr. Chairez-Perez and his citizen children then\n\ntestified concerning the hardship they would suffer if all of them left the United\n\nStates for Mexico.\n\n      In his subsequent oral decision, the IJ incorporated by reference his previous\n\ndetermination concerning Mr. Chairez-Perez\u2019s lack of good moral character. On the\n\nhardship issue, he found that Mr. Chairez-Perez had \u201cfailed to establish that if he\n\nwere removed from the United States, and his children . . . were to accompany him to\n\nMexico, that they would be subject to exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fAdmin. R. at 115. He therefore again denied Mr. Chairez-Perez\u2019s application on the\n\nhardship and moral character grounds.\n\n      But in his decision, the IJ also presented an alternate reason for denying relief:\n\n      In the event that the United States Board of Immigration Appeals or the\n      10th Circuit Court of Appeals on review were to find that the Court\u2019s\n      analysis of the hardship question was in error, the Court would note as\n      an alternative finding, that the respondent\u2019s application would also be\n      denied in the exercise of discretion. Pursuant to the REAL ID Act of\n      2005, a respondent seeking a grant of non-LPR cancellation must\n      establish that he is deserving of a favorable exercise of this Court\u2019s\n      discretion.\n\nId. at 115-16 (emphasis added).\n\n      In support of his discretionary decision, the IJ noted evidence showing that\n\nMr. Chairez-Perez:\n\n   \uf0b7 Had been working in the United States illegally and without authorization\n\n       since 1992;\n\n   \uf0b7 Purchased a false lawful permanent resident card in the United States, and\n\n       used the card to gain employment;\n\n   \uf0b7 Claimed, on more than one occasion, to be a lawful permanent resident of the\n\n       United States to seek employment in this country;\n\n   \uf0b7 Had purchased, four or five times, false Social Security cards, and had\n\n       purchased, four or five times, false Social Security numbers;\n\n   \uf0b7 Used false Social Security numbers even after he lawfully obtained a taxpayer\n\n       identification number;\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f    \uf0b7 Paid a smuggler to bring him to the United States, and later paid a smuggler to\n\n       bring his family here;\n\n    \uf0b7 Failed to register for the draft, as required by the Selective Service Act; and\n\n    \uf0b7 Had two convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\n      The IJ concluded that \u201ceven if the respondent had established the hardship\n\nrequirement [he] would deny the application in the exercise of discretion for the\n\nreasons set forth above.\u201d Id. at 117.\n\n      Mr. Chairez-Perez appealed to the BIA. His appeal brief addressed the scope\n\nof the hearing on remand and the IJ\u2019s denial of relief on hardship and good moral\n\ncharacter grounds. But he did not specifically challenge the alternative disposition\n\ndenying him relief in the exercise of discretion.\n\n      The BIA dismissed the appeal. It noted Mr. Chairez-Perez\u2019s complaints about\n\nthe scope of the hearing on remand, but found it \u201cunnecessary to consider whether\n\nthe Immigration Judge should have reconsidered his previous findings regarding the\n\nrespondent\u2019s good moral character\u201d and unnecessary to address the IJ\u2019s decision\n\nconcerning hardship. Id. at 4 & n.1. Instead, the BIA relied on the IJ\u2019s alternative\n\ndecision denying the application in his discretion, which it found adequately\n\nsupported. It noted Mr. Chairez-Perez did not dispute the IJ\u2019s factual findings in\n\nsupport of his discretionary decision. The BIA summarized the factual findings in\n\nfavor of that decision and concluded \u201c[t]he respondent does not address the [IJ\u2019s]\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdiscretionary denial on appeal. Under these circumstances, we find no reason to\n\ndisturb the [IJ\u2019s] decision in this case.\u201d Id. at 4.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n       Our scope of review is narrow. The BIA reached its challenged decision on\n\ndiscretionary grounds. We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary aspects of the\n\nagency\u2019s decision to deny an application for cancellation of removal. See 8 U.S.C.\n\n\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I) (\u201c[N]o court shall have jurisdiction to review . . . any judgment\n\nregarding the granting of relief under section . . . 1229b\u201d); Sabido Valdivia v.\n\nGonzales, 423 F.3d 1144, 1148-49 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding that \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(I)\n\nstrips this court of jurisdiction to review discretionary aspects of a decision\n\nconcerning cancellation of removal). We may, however, address substantial\n\nconstitutional claims or questions of law pertaining to the denial of the application,\n\n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); Alvarez-Delmuro v. Ashcroft, 360 F.3d 1254, 1256\n\n(10th Cir. 2004). Our review of such constitutional and legal issues is de novo.\n\nAlzainati v. Holder, 568 F.3d 844, 851 (10th Cir. 2009).\n\n       Mr. Chairez-Perez attempts to raise a constitutional due process issue. He\n\nargues the IJ and the BIA could not have decided his application on discretionary\n\ngrounds because they lacked an adequate factual basis. He contends the IJ did not\n\npermit him to present evidence on remand concerning his moral character, thereby\n\ndepriving him of a full and fair hearing and due process of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f      We cannot address the merits of this argument. Though he was aware of the\n\nIJ\u2019s alternate, discretionary ground for his decision, in his second appeal to the BIA,\n\nMr. Chairez-Perez raised no objection to that alternate ground at all. See Appeal Br.,\n\nAdmin. R. at 15-35; Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to Notice of Appeal, id. at 71-72. He only obliquely\n\neven mentioned the discretionary component of the cancellation inquiry. See id. at\n\n24 (noting that to receive cancellation of removal, among other things, alien must\n\nshow he is deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion). His generalized\n\ncomplaints to the BIA about due process and about his not being permitted to present\n\ngood moral character evidence did not address the discretionary decision.\n\n      In sum, Mr. Chairez-Perez failed to exhaust his challenge to the IJ\u2019s\n\ndiscretionary decision before the agency, and we thus lack jurisdiction to consider his\n\nchallenge to that decision. See, e.g., Sidabutar v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 1116, 1118\n\n(10th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[W]e generally assert jurisdiction only over those arguments that a\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fpetitioner properly presents to the BIA\u201d).1 The petition for review is therefore\n\ndenied.\n\n                                               Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                               Scott M.

But Mr. Chairez-Perez\u2019s constitutional claim was the type of due process\nclaim that we have held must be exhausted.\n\n             Courts have carved out an exception to the exhaustion\n      requirement for constitutional challenges to the immigration laws,\n      because the BIA has no jurisdiction to review such claims.\n      Nevertheless, the BIA does have the authority to reopen cases to fix\n      administratively correctable procedural errors, even when these errors\n      are failures to follow due process.\n\nAkinwunmi v.

The BIA summarized the factual findings in\n\nfavor of that decision and concluded \u201c[t]he respondent does not address the [IJ\u2019s]\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdiscretionary denial on appeal.

The BIA reached its challenged decision on\n\ndiscretionary grounds. We lack jurisdiction to review the discretionary aspects of the\n\nagency\u2019s decision to deny an application for cancellation of removal.

He\n\nargues the IJ and the BIA could not have decided his application on discretionary\n\ngrounds because they lacked an adequate factual basis. He contends the IJ did not\n\npermit him to present evidence on remand concerning his moral character, thereby\n\ndepriving him of a full and fair hearing and due process of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f      We cannot address the merits of this argument. Though he was aware of the\n\nIJ\u2019s alternate, discretionary ground for his decision, in his second appeal to the BIA,\n\nMr. Chairez-Perez raised no objection to that alternate ground at all. See Appeal Br.,\n\nAdmin. R. at 15-35; Exhibit \u201cA\u201d to Notice of Appeal, id. at 71-72. He only obliquely\n\neven mentioned the discretionary component of the cancellation inquiry. See id. at\n\n24 (noting that to receive cancellation of removal, among other things, alien must\n\nshow he is deserving of a favorable exercise of discretion). His generalized\n\ncomplaints to the BIA about due process and about his not being permitted to present\n\ngood moral character evidence did not address the discretionary decision.\n\n      In sum, Mr. Chairez-Perez failed to exhaust his challenge to the IJ\u2019s\n\ndiscretionary decision before the agency, and we thus lack jurisdiction to consider his\n\nchallenge to that decision.
