Eaton, of the United States Court of International Trade,\nsitting by designation.\n\fAppeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Geraci, J.).\n\n     ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED,\nAND DECREED that this appeal hereby is DISMISSED.\n\n        Ronald Cleveland appeals from the November 14, 2014 judgment entered in the United\nStates District Court for the Western District of New York (Geraci, J.). The district court\nsentenced Cleveland principally to 125 months\u2019 imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019\nfamiliarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.\n\n       Cleveland pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement that contained the following\nappeal waiver:\n\n       The defendant understands that Title 18, United States Code, Section 3742 affords\n       a defendant a limited right to appeal the sentence imposed. The defendant,\n       however, knowingly waives the right to appeal and collaterally attack any\n       component of a sentence imposed by the Court which falls within or is less than\n       the sentencing range for imprisonment, a fine and supervised release set forth in\n       Section III, \u00b6 13, above, notwithstanding the manner in which the Court\n       determines the sentence. In the event of an appeal of the defendant\u2019s sentence by\n       the government, the defendant reserves the right to argue the correctness of the\n       defendant\u2019s sentence.\n\nApp\u2019x at 52. The district court\u2019s 125-month sentence \u201cfalls within . . . the sentencing range for\nimprisonment\u201d set forth in the plea agreement. The government argues that we should enforce\nthis agreement and dismiss this appeal.\n\n       \u201cIt is . . . well established that a knowing and voluntary waiver of the right to appeal is\ngenerally enforceable.\u201d United States v. Hernandez, 242 F.3d 110, 113 (2d Cir. 2001). However,\n\u201c[e]ven if the plain language of the plea agreement bar[s] [an] appeal, we [will] not enforce such\na waiver of appellate rights . . . [where] the defendant is challenging the constitutionality of the\nprocess by which he waived those rights.\u201d Id.\n\n        Cleveland contends that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in\nmaking his plea agreement, including the appeal-waiver provision. \u201cIneffective assistance with\nrespect to an appeal waiver, if proven, would cast doubt on enforceability of the appeal-waiver\nprovision.\u201d United States v. Oladimeji, 463 F.3d 152, 155 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n        Typically, \u201ca waiver of appellate or collateral attack rights does not foreclose an attack on\nthe validity of the process by which the waiver has been procured, [such as] the plea agreement,\u201d\nincluding an ineffective assistance claim. Frederick v. Warden, Lewisburg Corr. Facility, 308\nF.3d 192, 195 (2d Cir. 2002). However, \u201c[w]here the record on appeal does not include the facts\nnecessary to adjudicate a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, our usual practice is not to\nconsider the claim on the direct appeal, but to leave it to the defendant to raise the claims on a\npetition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d Id. at 154. \u201c[C]ollateral review typically\nprovides a far better opportunity for an evaluation of an ineffective-assistance claim than direct\nreview, because a factual record focused on the defendant\u2019s claim can be developed in the\n\n                                                 2\n\fdistrict court, including by \u2018tak[ing] testimony from witnesses for the defendant and the\nprosecution and from the counsel alleged to have rendered the deficient performance.\u2019\u201d Id.\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500, 504-05 (2003)).\n\n        Our preference for not considering claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct\nappeal applies equally to the circumstance where, as here, the defendant claims that his counsel\u2019s\nineffective assistance rendered his appeal waiver unenforceable. See id. at 154-55. If \u201cthe record\ndoes not permit assessment of the claim of ineffective assistance and its potential effects on the\nappeal waiver, the defendant\u2019s undertaking not to appeal will be provisionally enforced as to any\nappellate claim that falls under the appeal waiver, unless and until he prevails (by a habeas\npetition) in proving that his appeal waiver should be voided because he received ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\u201d Id. at 155.\n\n        Here, the record before us does not contain the information necessary to resolve\nCleveland\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective in failing to seek to reserve his right to appeal\nthe district court\u2019s imposition of the obstruction-of-justice enhancement. Accordingly, we\ndismiss this appeal. The dismissal is without prejudice to Cleveland reasserting his claims in a\npetition for habeas corpus if he demonstrates that his appeal waiver should be nullified because\nhe received ineffective assistance.\n\n        We have considered the remainder of Cleveland\u2019s arguments and find them to be without\nmerit. Accordingly, this appeal is DISMISSED.\n\n                                                      FOR THE COURT:\n                                                      Catherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">14-4389-cr\nUnited States v.
