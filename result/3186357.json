The defendant,\n       however, knowingly waives the right to appeal and collaterally attack any\n       component of a sentence imposed by the Court which falls within or is less than\n       the sentencing range for imprisonment, a fine and supervised release set forth in\n       Section III, \u00b6 13, above, notwithstanding the manner in which the Court\n       determines the sentence.
