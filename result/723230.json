Although the EEOC had ruled that Lawrence was entitled to reinstatement and back pay, the district court refused to enter an order of enforcement.  With regard to the issue of reinstatement, the district court noted that the Postal Service had offered Lawrence reinstatement subject to her taking a standard medical examination, but that Lawrence rejected the offer by letter dated April 13, 1991.  As for Lawrence's claim for back pay, the court noted that Lawrence had been receiving disability payments since March 23, 1984 under the Civil Service Retirement Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 8331-8348, after the Office of Personnel Management had determined that she was disabled and hence unable to work.  The court concluded that Lawrence's lost wages since March 23, 1984 were the result of her disability, not any discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her opening brief on appeal, Lawrence offers no intelligible argument for reversing the district court's judgment.  She presents one page of argument, in which she discusses neither the district court's reasoning nor any pertinent legal authorities.  As a result, she has waived any argument on appeal.  Gagan v.
