Jensen,\nAssistant Attorney General, Tampa, for\nAppellee.\n\n\nALTENBERND, Judge.\n\n             Samuel Cornel Hilliard appeals his judgments and sentences for delivery\n\nof cocaine, possession of cocaine, and possession of paraphernalia. The trial and\n\nsentencing hearing were conducted in Mr. Hilliard's absence. We conclude that the trial\n\fcourt erred in summarily denying a motion following sentencing that challenged whether\n\nhis absence was voluntary. As we did in Jackson v. State, 144 So. 3d 658 (Fla. 2d DCA\n\n2014), we remand this case for an evidentiary hearing on the motion to determine the\n\nfactual issue of whether his absence from both his trial and sentencing hearing was\n\nvoluntary or involuntary.\n\n              Mr. Hilliard was charged with these offenses in May 2013 within about six\n\nmonths of his release from prison for other offenses. His trial was first set for\n\nSeptember 16, 2013. He did not appear and a capias was issued. On September 17,\n\nhe filed a motion to withdraw the capias, in which he stated that his failure to appear\n\nwas not willful but was due to his admission to Northside Mental Health Center on\n\nSeptember 13. A letter from his case manager was attached to his motion and\n\nexplained that as of September 16, Mr. Hilliard had not been discharged. His trial was\n\ncontinued and rescheduled for October 28, 2013.\n\n              Mr. Hilliard attended jury selection as scheduled on October 28. On that\n\nday, the trial court ordered him to appear for trial on October 31, 2013, and advised him\n\nthat the trial could continue in his absence if he did not appear. Mr. Hilliard failed to\n\nappear for trial on October 31, 2013. Mr. Hilliard's attorney informed the trial judge that\n\nhe had not heard from him and did not know where he was. The judge commented on\n\nthe record that while he did not know whether something had happened to Mr. Hilliard\n\nor why he had not appeared, the court had warned Mr. Hilliard that his trial could\n\ncontinue in his absence and thus it would. The trial proceeded without Mr. Hilliard, and\n\nhe was convicted as charged that same day. The trial court immediately sentenced Mr.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fHilliard in absentia to concurrent sentences, the longest of which is fifteen years'\n\nimprisonment.\n\n              On November 15, 2013, Mr. Hilliard was arrested for failure to appear. On\n\nNovember 22, 2013, Mr. Hilliard's attorney filed a motion in which he represented that\n\nMr. Hilliard did not appear for trial on October 31 because he was hospitalized that day\n\nat Tampa General Hospital and subsequently transferred to Memorial Hospital under\n\nthe Baker Act. Mr. Hilliard apparently had been released from the hospital on\n\nNovember 1. Mr. Hilliard's attorney supported his motion with a copy of the medical\n\nrecords from this hospitalization. Neither the motion nor the record explains Mr.\n\nHilliard's whereabouts for the two weeks following his release from the hospital. The\n\ntrial court summarily denied this motion.1\n\n              Among a defendant's most basic constitutional rights is the right to be\n\npresent at all critical stages of his criminal proceeding, including trial and sentencing.\n\nIllinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 338 (1970). It is possible, however, to waive this right.\n\nSee id. at 339-47; see also Blair v. State, 25 So. 3d 46, 47 (Fla. 5th DCA 2009). Florida\n\nRule of Criminal Procedure 3.180(c) accordingly provides that a defendant's trial and\n\nsentencing can proceed when the defendant is present at the beginning of trial but\n\nthereafter \"voluntarily absents himself or herself.\" Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.180(c)(1)-(2).\n\n\n\n              1\n                As was the case in Jackson v. State, 144 So. 3d 658, 659 n.1 (Fla. 2d\nDCA 2014), Mr. Hilliard filed the motion prior to the direct appeal and titled the motion\nas one to reduce or modify sentence under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.800(c).\nThis is an odd choice of rules to use for this motion, but because this motion was filed\noutside of the time period allowed for a motion for new trial, see Fla. R. Crim. P.\n3.590(a), there may have been no other alternative vehicle with which to raise the issue.\nGiven the important constitutional right in question, there is no doubt that Mr. Hilliard\nwas entitled to raise and obtain a ruling on this issue of the voluntariness of his absence\nat this stage in the proceedings so that it could be reviewed on this direct appeal.\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fOnce a defendant appears for the commencement of trial but is thereafter absent, it is\n\nthe defendant's burden to demonstrate to the trial court that his or her absence was\n\ninvoluntary. See Jackson, 144 So. 3d at 659; Blair, 25 So. 3d at 48.\n\n              Here, the trial court did not err by proceeding with the trial and sentencing\n\nwithout Mr. Hilliard where Mr. Hilliard had appeared for jury selection and was warned\n\nthat his trial could continue without him if he did not thereafter appear. It did err,\n\nhowever, in summarily denying Mr. Hilliard's motion without granting him an evidentiary\n\nhearing to determine whether his absence was voluntary or involuntary. See Jackson,\n\n144 So. 3d at 659-60; Blair, 25 So. 3d at 48-49. The submission of his hospital records,\n\nwhich showed that he was admitted to Tampa General on the day of trial with serious\n\nmental health symptoms, was enough to warrant a hearing on the matter.\n\n              We reject the State's argument that because Mr. Hilliard's medical records\n\nreflect that he admitted himself to Tampa General on the day of trial, the record\n\nconclusively shows that his absence from trial and sentencing was voluntary. It is\n\nentirely possible that a criminal defendant with legitimate mental health issues could\n\nvoluntarily seek medical treatment that would render him involuntarily unavailable for\n\ntrial. Certainly, if Mr. Hilliard had voluntarily admitted himself to the hospital due to a\n\nstroke or heart attack, the State would not make this argument. Mental illness in some\n\ninstances can be as debilitating as other serious illnesses.\n\n              For this same reason, while we recognize that Mr. Hilliard's absence from\n\nhis initial trial date in September and the similar circumstances surrounding it may make\n\nthe nature of his second absence more suspect, this also does not compel the\n\nconclusion that the second absence was voluntary. It is possible that Mr. Hilliard has\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\flegitimate mental health issues that caused him to be involuntarily absent in both\n\ninstances, and he has met the threshold to require a full evidentiary hearing on the\n\nmatter.\n\n              We thus remand this case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to\n\ndetermine whether Mr. Hilliard's absence from his trial and sentencing hearing was\n\nvoluntary or involuntary. Procedurally, we reverse the judgments and sentences to\n\nfacilitate this hearing and its possible appellate review. If the trial court determines that\n\nMr. Hilliard's absence from trial was voluntary, it should enter an appropriate order\n\ndenying the motion and it should reinstate the judgments and sentences. This court,\n\nupon timely notice of appeal from the reinstated judgments and sentences, will review\n\nthat order. If the trial court determines that Mr. Hilliard's absence was involuntary, it\n\nshould enter an appropriate order on the motion and, under the circumstances of this\n\ncase as reflected in the record, enter an order granting a new trial. The order granting a\n\nnew trial may be timely appealed by the State to permit review of the order on the\n\nmotion. See Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(c)(1)(C).\n\n              Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\nSLEET and LUCAS, JJ., Concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">               NOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING\n                      MOTION AND, IF FILED, DETERMINED\n\n                                               IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL\n\n                                               OF FLORIDA\n\n                                               SECOND DISTRICT\n\nSAMUEL C.

It did err,\n\nhowever, in summarily denying Mr. Hilliard's motion without granting him an evidentiary\n\nhearing to determine whether his absence was voluntary or involuntary. See Jackson,\n\n144 So. 3d at 659-60; Blair, 25 So. 3d at 48-49. The submission of his hospital records,\n\nwhich showed that he was admitted to Tampa General on the day of trial with serious\n\nmental health symptoms, was enough to warrant a hearing on the matter.\n\n              We reject the State's argument that because Mr. Hilliard's medical records\n\nreflect that he admitted himself to Tampa General on the day of trial, the record\n\nconclusively shows that his absence from trial and sentencing was voluntary. It is\n\nentirely possible that a criminal defendant with legitimate mental health issues could\n\nvoluntarily seek medical treatment that would render him involuntarily unavailable for\n\ntrial. Certainly, if Mr. Hilliard had voluntarily admitted himself to the hospital due to a\n\nstroke or heart attack, the State would not make this argument. Mental illness in some\n\ninstances can be as debilitating as other serious illnesses.\n\n              For this same reason, while we recognize that Mr. Hilliard's absence from\n\nhis initial trial date in September and the similar circumstances surrounding it may make\n\nthe nature of his second absence more suspect, this also does not compel the\n\nconclusion that the second absence was voluntary. It is possible that Mr. Hilliard has\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\flegitimate mental health issues that caused him to be involuntarily absent in both\n\ninstances, and he has met the threshold to require a full evidentiary hearing on the\n\nmatter.\n\n              We thus remand this case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to\n\ndetermine whether Mr. Hilliard's absence from his trial and sentencing hearing was\n\nvoluntary or involuntary. Procedurally, we reverse the judgments and sentences to\n\nfacilitate this hearing and its possible appellate review. If the trial court determines that\n\nMr. Hilliard's absence from trial was voluntary, it should enter an appropriate order\n\ndenying the motion and it should reinstate the judgments and sentences. This court,\n\nupon timely notice of appeal from the reinstated judgments and sentences, will review\n\nthat order. If the trial court determines that Mr. Hilliard's absence was involuntary, it\n\nshould enter an appropriate order on the motion and, under the circumstances of this\n\ncase as reflected in the record, enter an order granting a new trial. The order granting a\n\nnew trial may be timely appealed by the State to permit review of the order on the\n\nmotion. See Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(c)(1)(C).\n\n              Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\nSLEET and LUCAS, JJ., Concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
