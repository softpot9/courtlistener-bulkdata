INTRODUCTION\n\n      Appellant George Jamil Wehbe appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his\n\napplication for post-conviction writ of habeas corpus. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\n\nAnn. art. 11.072 (West 2005). Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nby denying his application, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s order.\n\n\n      1\n       See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\f                                 II. BACKGROUND\n\n      Wehbe was convicted of theft of vehicles with a combined value of not less\n\nthan $1,500 but not more than $20,000, a state jail felony. See Tex. Penal Code\n\nAnn. \u00a7 31.03(a), (e)(4) (West Supp. 2012). The trial court sentenced Wehbe to a\n\n$1,000 fine and two years\u2019 confinement, with the confinement portion of his\n\nsentence probated for five years. Wehbe appealed to this court, arguing in part\n\nthat the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. See Wehbe v. State,\n\nNo. 02-07-00407-CR, 2011 WL 1743785, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth May 5,\n\n2011, pet. ref\u2019d) (mem. op., not designated for publication). We held that the\n\nevidence was insufficient to support a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nas to theft of two of the four vehicles that the State alleged Wehbe had stolen,\n\nbut we ultimately upheld the state-jail-felony theft conviction because we held the\n\nevidence sufficient as to theft of the remaining two vehicles and because the\n\nevidence showed that the combined value of those two vehicles was over\n\n$1,500. See id. at *6\u20138; see also Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 31.03(e)(4).\n\n      Wehbe subsequently filed an application for writ of habeas corpus, seeking\n\nreformation of the judgment to reflect conviction for class A misdemeanor theft\n\nand to lower his community supervision term to two years. He argued that this\n\ncourt\u2019s determination on appeal that insufficient evidence existed to show theft of\n\ntwo of the vehicles, coupled with the trial court\u2019s determination that Wehbe owed\n\nrestitution to the owners of the two remaining vehicles in the amount of $1,100,\n\ndemonstrate that the value of the property stolen does not satisfy the\n\n\n                                        2\n\fjurisdictional $1,500 minimum for state jail felony theft. After the State filed a\n\nresponse, the trial court denied Wehbe\u2019s application and entered findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law.2\n\n                      III. SUFFICIENCY CLAIM NOT COGNIZABLE\n\n      Article 11.072 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure \u2015establishes the\n\nprocedures for an application for a writ of habeas corpus in a felony or\n\nmisdemeanor case in which the applicant seeks relief from an order or a\n\njudgment of conviction ordering community supervision.\u2016 Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\n\nAnn. art. 11.072, \u00a7 1. When reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of an application for\n\nwrit of habeas corpus under article 11.072, the appellate court must view the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling and uphold that ruling\n\nabsent an abuse of discretion. See Ex Parte Wheeler, 203 S.W.3d 317, 324\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\n      Generally, a claim that has been previously raised and rejected on direct\n\nappeal is not cognizable on habeas corpus. Ex parte Torres, 943 S.W.2d 469,\n\n475 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997); Doyle v. State, 317 S.W.3d 471, 476 (Tex. App.\u2014\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. ref\u2019d); see also Ex parte Brown, 205 S.W.3d 538,\n\n      2\n        The trial court did not enter a written order denying the application, but at\nthe end of its findings of fact and conclusions of law, under a paragraph entitled,\n\u2015Recommendation,\u2016 it states, \u2015For all the above reasons, this Court recommends\nthat relief be denied on Applicant\u2019s habeas petition. So ordered on this 10 day of\nMay of 2013.\u2016 We will consider this as a written order. See Tex. Code Crim.\nProc. Ann. art. 11.072, \u00a7 6(a) (\u2015[T]he trial court shall enter a written order granting\nor denying the relief sought in the application.\u2016); Few v. State, 230 S.W.3d 184,\n189 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (declining to elevate form over substance).\n\n\n                                          3\n\f546 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). Additionally, a challenge to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence is not cognizable on an application for a post-conviction writ of habeas\n\ncorpus. Ex parte Perales, 215 S.W.3d 418, 419 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Ex parte\n\nGrigsby, 137 S.W.3d 673, 674 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). The sole exception is\n\nwhen the record is \u2015totally devoid\u2016 of evidentiary support so as to render the\n\nconviction unconstitutional under the due process clause of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution. Perales, 215 S.W.3d at 419\u201320.\n\n      Wehbe\u2019s complaint in his application\u2014that the value of the two vehicles\n\nstolen does not satisfy the jurisdictional $1,500 minimum for a state-jail-felony\n\ntheft conviction\u2014boils down to a complaint about the sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nSee Perales, 215 S.W.3d at 419\u201320; see also Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n11.072, \u00a7 3(a) (\u2015An application may not be filed under this article if the applicant\n\ncould obtain the requested relief by means of an appeal . . . .\u2016). We addressed\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence on direct appeal, where we determined that \u2015[t]he\n\nevidence shows that the combined value of [the two vehicles] exceeded the\n\n$1,500 jurisdictional minimum for state jail felony theft.\u2016      Wehbe, 2011 WL\n\n1743785, at *8. Having previously rejected his sufficiency claim on direct appeal,\n\nwe hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that\n\nWehbe\u2019s claim is not cognizable in a habeas proceeding.3 See Ex parte Torres,\n\n943 S.W.2d at 475; Doyle, 317 S.W.3d at 476.\n\n\n      3\n        Wehbe has filed a motion requesting that this court take judicial notice of\nthe trial court\u2019s record from his trial and of our opinion on direct appeal. See Tex.\n\n                                         4\n\f                               IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We affirm the trial court\u2019s order denying Wehbe\u2019s application for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus.\n\n\n\n                                          PER CURIAM\n\nPANEL: WALKER, J.; LIVINGSTON, C.J.; and GABRIEL, J.\n\nDO NOT PUBLISH\nTex.
