These alterations were made by the attorneys for both parties after the execution of the bond and after the bond had been served, filed, and become a court record. In these circumstances the attorneys were without authority to make the changes in the bond. 1 R.C.L. 983; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></span>.

The case is authority for the proposition that this court to promote the ends of justice may either order or direct the filing of an amended complaint. Fuller v. Fried, supra.
