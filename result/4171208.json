The trial court conducted a jury trial in\nJune 2015.\n\n            The State\u2019s proof at trial showed that the victim, C.H.,1 resided in Morgan\nCounty with his mother, A.H.,2 in September 2012. A.H. testified that the victim was\n\n1\n       It is the policy of this court to refer to minors by initials.\n2\n       To protect the anonymity of the minor victim, we will refer to his mother by her initials as well.\n\fborn on December 17, 2009, and that he was three months shy of his third birthday on\nSeptember 10, 2012.\n\n              A few days prior to September 10, the victim was accidentally run over by\na vehicle in a library parking lot but fortunately sustained only minor injuries. On\nSeptember 10, the defendant paid a visit to A.H.\u2019s residence to \u201ccheck on\u201d the victim\u2019s\nwell-being. The defendant sat on the floor of the living room and helped the victim play\nwith some toy trucks. After a few minutes, the victim decided to play in his bedroom,\nand the defendant asked A.H. if he could assist the victim in carrying the toys to the\nvictim\u2019s bedroom; A.H. acquiesced and followed them. While A.H. was standing outside\nof the victim\u2019s bedroom, her husband requested her assistance in locating an item, and\nA.H. walked away \u201cfor maybe a minute, minute and a half.\u201d When she returned to the\nvictim\u2019s bedroom, she saw the defendant \u201csticking his [penis] in my kid[\u2019]s mouth.\u201d\nA.H. stated that the defendant had one of his hands on the victim\u2019s head and that he was\nusing his other hand to hold his penis.\n\n               A.H. testified that she immediately \u201cstarted screaming,\u201d and the defendant\nreplied that he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing nothing,\u201d although A.H. could \u201cclearly see his pants were\nunbuttoned.\u201d A.H.\u2019s husband \u201chad to force [the defendant] out of the whole house,\u201d and\nthe defendant was \u201cscreaming I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d When police\nofficers arrived at the house, the defendant continued \u201cscreaming I\u2019m not right in the\nhead, I didn\u2019t mean to, I wasn\u2019t right, I didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d\n\n               A.H. admitted that she had been previously convicted of attempted forgery,\nmisdemeanor theft, misdemeanor criminal impersonation, and possession of less than half\na gram of methamphetamine and that she was currently serving a jail sentence in\nCumberland County. A.H. clarified that all of her criminal convictions had occurred after\nthe rape of the victim.\n\n              On cross-examination, A.H. stated that, when she reentered the victim\u2019s\nbedroom, the defendant was on his knees, and A.H. was adamant that she saw the\ndefendant\u2019s penis inside the victim\u2019s mouth. A.H. denied using any drugs on September\n10, 2012, and testified that she did not begin using methamphetamine until after the\nvictim\u2019s rape. A.H. denied that the victim had a history of grabbing men in the crotch.\nA.H. confirmed that she had contacted Mark and Linda Peterson shortly after the rape\noccurred, explaining that she had met the defendant through the Petersons and that she\nwanted to inform them of what had transpired because the defendant \u201cwould slip off into\nthe bedroom\u201d with the Petersons\u2019 children on prior occasions.\n\n             Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Department (\u201cMCSD\u201d) Chief Deputy Steve\nCochran testified that he interviewed the defendant on September 12, 2012. Chief\n                                          -2-\n\fCochran provided the defendant with his Miranda warnings, and the defendant signed a\nwaiver of his rights and agreed to speak with Chief Cochran. At that time, the defendant\nadmitted that he had placed his penis in the victim\u2019s mouth. Chief Cochran asked the\ndefendant \u201cwhat made [him] excited . . . about the child,\u201d and the defendant replied that\n\u201che was excited and turned on by\u201d seeing the victim \u201cin his diaper.\u201d The defendant\ndenied that he had committed any other sexual assaults or that \u201clittle boys turned him on\u201d\nprior to his assault of the victim. Following the interview, Chief Cochran asked the\ndefendant to give a handwritten statement, and the defendant complied, writing that he\n\u201cwent to his bedroom to play with him then after [I] played with him [I] stuck my penis\nin his mouth.\u201d\n\n              On cross-examination, Chief Cochran admitted that no video or audio\nrecording of his interview with the defendant existed. Chief Cochran acknowledged that\nhe did not inquire about the defendant\u2019s educational background but stated that he had\nread the Miranda warnings aloud to the defendant \u201cjust in case\u201d the defendant was unable\nto read. Chief Cochran conceded that the defendant had not signed his handwritten\nstatement, which was on the back side of the rights waiver form which he had signed.\n\n              On redirect examination, Chief Cochran stated that he had given\n\u201chundreds\u201d of interviews and Miranda warnings throughout his career in law\nenforcement and that he was able to discern when an interviewee understands the\nquestions being asked of him. Chief Cochran had \u201cno question\u201d about the defendant\u2019s\nability to understand his rights.\n\n              Kingston Police Department Officer Brian Luttrell testified that in\nSeptember 2012 he was employed as an MCSD corrections officer.

He went\n             over to see him. He went into the back room and was playing\n             with him, I think with some toy cars. And they were back\n             there by their self [sic]. He stated that the little boy being\n             injured and he was wearing a t-shirt and a diaper and that, in\n             some way, aroused him. Then he forced himself into the little\n             boy\u2019s mouth.\n\n                    ....\n\n                    He forced his penis into the little boy\u2019s mouth.\n                                           -3-\n\fOfficer Luttrell testified that he witnessed the defendant\u2019s signing of the rights waiver\nform and that he was present when the defendant handwrote his statement.\n\n              With this evidence, the State rested. The defendant then elected to testify\nand to present proof.\n\n              Kathy Bolden, the defendant\u2019s mother, testified that the defendant suffered\nfrom a learning disability, explaining that he \u201chad to have special learning all the way\nthrough school\u201d and had received \u201ca special learning diploma.\u201d Ms. Bolden elaborated,\nexplaining that \u201c[y]ou have to keep telling him in detail what you want him to do\u201d and\nthat, in school, he struggled with \u201ccomprehension and speech.\u201d Ms. Bolden testified that\nthe defendant disliked conflict and violence and that she was unaware of any prior history\nof sexual assault on the defendant\u2019s part.\n\n               Rob Wall, Ms. Bolden\u2019s boyfriend, described himself as a pseudo-\nstepfather to the defendant. Mr. Wall testified that the defendant was \u201ca little slow\u201d and\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t comprehend things\u201d quickly. On cross-examination, both Mr. Wall and Ms.\nBolden testified that the defendant knew the difference between right and wrong.\n\n               Steven Bolden, the defendant\u2019s younger brother, testified that the defendant\nwas \u201ca little autistic\u201d and had \u201ca short fuse\u201d with respect to conflict. Mr. Bolden recalled\none occasion on which the victim had \u201cgrabbed\u201d him by \u201chis privates.\u201d\n\n              Linda Peterson testified that she had become acquainted with the defendant\nwhen Steven Bolden began dating Ms. Peterson\u2019s roommate. Ms. Peterson stated that\nshe did not know the defendant \u201cthat well,\u201d explaining that he had visited her house on\nprior occasions and that he had played with her children. Ms. Peterson explained that the\nvictim was a year younger than her youngest child and stated that the victim \u201ccouldn\u2019t\ntalk\u201d and would \u201chit\u201d people to get what he wanted. Ms. Peterson testified that she had\nobserved the victim strike people in the crotch on prior occasions.\n\n               With respect to the victim\u2019s rape, Ms. Peterson recalled that A.H. had\ncalled her on September 10 to inform her that the defendant \u201chad molested\u201d the victim.\nAccording to Ms. Peterson, A.H. was hysterical and told her that she had seen the victim\n\u201cright at [the defendant\u2019s] crotch area.\u201d Ms. Peterson stated that, after the rape, A.H. was\ninconsistent in her description of the assault:\n\n                      One time he\u2019s on his knees. The next time he was\n              standing up. It didn\u2019t happen, it did happen. She never could\n              tell the same story.\n                                            -4-\n\f               The defendant testified and categorically denied engaging in any sexual\ncontact with the victim. According to the defendant, he had been at the local library on\nSeptember 10, 2012, conducting research on a \u201ctruck driving job\u201d when he noticed A.H.\nat the library. As he was walking home, it occurred to him that he should speak with\nA.H.\u2019s husband about a job, so he walked to A.H.\u2019s residence. Upon his arrival, he\nencountered A.H. standing by her mailbox. She told him about the victim\u2019s recent\naccident and asked the defendant if he would like to see the victim. The defendant said\nthat he would, explaining to the jury that he \u201cused that excuse to ask [A.H.\u2019s husband]\nabout\u201d a job.\n\n              Once inside, the defendant sat in the living room and chatted with A.H.\nwhile the victim played in the floor and A.H.\u2019s husband sat nearby. Because A.H.\u2019s\nhusband \u201cnever spoke\u201d to the defendant, the defendant became uncomfortable and asked\nA.H. if he \u201ccould go check on the little boy\u2019s toys.\u201d A.H. responded in the affirmative,\nand the defendant proceeded to the victim\u2019s bedroom. While the victim was playing on\nthe floor with his toys, the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone \u201cvibrated,\u201d and the defendant\nremoved the telephone from his pocket. Upon spotting the telephone, the victim\nadvanced toward the defendant and attempted to grab the telephone but missed and struck\nthe defendant in the area of his crotch. The defendant moved the victim\u2019s hand away and\ninstructed him not to do that again. The victim then sat down in the floor, resumed\nplaying, and pointed to the upper area of the closet where the victim\u2019s trucks were\nlocated. When the defendant was attempting to retrieve the trucks, A.H. appeared. She\nremoved the victim from the bedroom, and her husband \u201cescorted\u201d the defendant from\nthe house. A.H. then walked outside while speaking on her cellular telephone, stating\nthat the defendant was \u201cdown here trying to put his [penis] in [the victim\u2019s] mouth.\u201d\n\n              When the defendant arrived at the jail, officers forced him \u201cto strip down in\nfront of a bunch of people\u201d and informed him that he was being charged with aggravated\nrape of a child; he testified that he did not know what \u201caggravated\u201d meant at that time.\nThe defendant claimed that Officer Luttrell \u201charass[ed him] verbally\u201d throughout the\nnight. When Officer Luttrell brought him to Chief Cochran\u2019s office, Chief Cochran read\nthe Miranda rights to the defendant and asked him if he understood his rights. The\ndefendant testified that he did not respond because he was \u201cso scared.\u201d He stated that he\nwrote the statement for the officers \u201cout of fear, not guilt,\u201d believing that the officers\n\u201cwould leave [him] alone.\u201d The defendant testified that he merely wrote a statement of\nwhat he was being accused of rather than what had actually transpired.\n\n             Chief Cochran testified on rebuttal for the State and denied telling the\ndefendant what to write in his statement. Chief Cochran stated that the defendant never\ndenied assaulting the victim and that the defendant even volunteered the detail about the\n                                           -5-\n\fvictim\u2019s diaper causing him to be aroused. With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that\nOfficer Luttrell had verbally harassed him, Chief Cochran explained that Officer Luttrell\ncould not have worked an overnight shift at the jail and then been present the following\nmorning to assist in the the defendant\u2019s interview.\n\n              Based on this evidence, the jury convicted the defendant as charged of one\ncount of aggravated rape of a child. Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court\nsentenced the defendant as a deemed Range III offender to a term of 40 years\u2019\nincarceration to be served at 100 percent by operation of law.\n\n               Following the denial of his timely motion for new trial, the defendant filed\na timely notice of appeal. In this appeal, the defendant contends that the evidence is\ninsufficient to support his conviction and that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the\njury on rape of a child as a lesser included offense. We will address each issue in turn.\n\n                                        I. Sufficiency\n\n              The defendant first contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his\nconviction of aggravated rape of a child. We disagree.\n\n              We review the defendant\u2019s claim of insufficient evidence mindful that our\nstandard of review is whether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt. Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.\n307, 319 (1979); State v. Winters, 137 S.W.3d 641, 654 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003). This\nstandard applies to findings of guilt based upon direct evidence, circumstantial evidence,\nor a combination of direct and circumstantial evidence. State v. Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d\n370, 379 (Tenn. 2011).\n\n               When examining the sufficiency of the evidence, this court should neither\nre-weigh the evidence nor substitute its inferences for those drawn by the trier of fact. Id.\nQuestions concerning the credibility of the witnesses, the weight and value of the\nevidence, as well as all factual issues raised by the evidence are resolved by the trier of\nfact. State v. Cabbage, 571 S.W.2d 832, 835 (Tenn. 1978). Significantly, this court must\nafford the State the strongest legitimate view of the evidence contained in the record as\nwell as all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the evidence.\nId.\n\n              As charged in this case, \u201c[a]ggravated rape of a child is the unlawful sexual\npenetration of a victim by the defendant or the defendant by a victim if the victim is three\n(3) years of age or less.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-531(a). \u201cSexual penetration\u201d is defined as\n                                              -6-\n\f\u201csexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any other intrusion,\nhowever slight, of any part of a person\u2019s body or of any object into the genital or anal\nopenings of the victim\u2019s, the defendant\u2019s, or any other person\u2019s body, but emission of\nsemen is not required.\u201d Id. \u00a7 39-13-501(7).\n\n              In the instant case, the proof at trial established that the defendant inserted\nhis penis into the two-year-old victim\u2019s mouth. A.H. testified that she witnessed this\nassault, and the defendant admitted to Chief Cochran and Officer Luttrell that he had\nbecome \u201caroused\u201d by the sight of the toddler in a diaper, resulting in his placing his penis\ninside the victim\u2019s mouth. Although the defendant denied the rape and claimed that he\nwas \u201cintimidated\u201d into confessing to the crime, such matters of witness credibility and\nevidentiary weight are within the exclusive province of the trier of fact, and this court\nwill not reweigh such evidence. See Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d at 379.\n\n               The defendant primarily takes issue with the evidence of the victim\u2019s age,\nclaiming that \u201cthere was minimal and somewhat conflicting evidence of the age of the\nchild at the time of the incident.\u201d To the contrary, the victim\u2019s mother, A.H., testified\nthat the victim was born on December 17, 2009; thus, the victim was one week shy of\ntwo years and nine months when the rape occurred on September 10, 2012. Furthermore,\na review of the trial transcript reveals that A.H. referenced the victim\u2019s being two years\nof age no less than nine times during the course of her testimony.\n\n              Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we\nfind that the evidence adduced at trial overwhelmingly supports the defendant\u2019s\nconviction of aggravated rape of a child.\n\n                                     II. Jury Instruction\n\n               The defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the\njury \u201con the lesser included offense of Rape of a Child.\u201d Again, we disagree.\n\n              Nothing in the record suggests that the defendant contemporaneously\nobjected to the trial court\u2019s failure to include an instruction on rape of a child, and thus,\nhe has waived our consideration of this issue. A defendant complaining of the omission\nof an instruction must make a special request that the instruction be given or otherwise\nobject to the omission. See Tenn. R. Crim. P. 30(a), (b); State v. Cravens, 764 S.W.2d\n754, 757-78 (Tenn. 1989); State v. Haynes, 720 S.W.2d 76, 84-85 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n1986); Bolton v. State, 591 S.W.2d 446, 448 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1979). In addition,\nneither a transcript of the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury nor the written jury instructions\nare included in the record. The appellant bears the burden of preparing an adequate\nrecord on appeal, see State v. Ballard, 855 S.W.2d 557, 560 (Tenn. 1993), which includes\n                                             -7-\n\fthe duty to \u201chave prepared a transcript of such part of the evidence or proceedings as is\nnecessary to convey a fair, accurate and complete account of what transpired with respect\nto those issues that are the bases of appeal,\u201d Tenn. R. App. P. 24(b). If the appellant fails\nto prepare an adequate record, this court must presume the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.\nSee State v. Richardson, 875 S.W.2d 671, 674 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\n\n                Furthermore, the scant reference to jury instructions in the trial transcript\nreveals that both the State and the defense agreed on the pertinent instructions to be\ngiven. Just prior to the return of the jury to the courtroom and the reading of the verdict,\nthe trial court made the following announcement:\n\n                     All right, for the record we had a chambers meeting\n              going over the jury instructions for this case and determined\n              that with both sides that the proper charge would be the\n              Aggravated Rape Of A Child, and as a lesser included\n              Aggravated Sexual Battery. And that that would complete\n              the part on the charge.\n\n              In any event, an instruction on rape of a child would have been improper in\nthis case because rape of a child is not a lesser included offense of aggravated rape of a\nchild. An offense is considered a lesser included offense if it contains all of the statutory\nelements of the offense charged, if it involves the facilitation, attempt, or solicitation of\nthe offense charged, or if it is specifically designated as a lesser included offense by\nstatute. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-18-110(f). In addition, an offense is lesser included if it differs from\nthe charged offense only in that it requires a less culpable mental state or requires a less\nserious harm or risk of harm to the same victim. See State v. Howard, 504 S.W.3d 260,\n268-75 (Tenn. 2016) (citing State v. Burns, 6 S.W.3d 453 (Tenn. 1999)).\n\n               Here, the defendant was convicted of aggravated rape of a child, which is\ndefined as \u201cthe unlawful sexual penetration of a victim by the defendant or the defendant\nby a victim, if the victim is three (3) years of age or less.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-531(a). Rape\nof a child is defined as \u201cthe unlawful sexual penetration of a victim by the defendant or\nthe defendant by the victim, if the victim is more than three (3) years of age but less than\nthirteen (13) years of age.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-522(a).\n\n              Clearly, rape of a child is not a lesser included offense of aggravated rape\nof a child. The latter offense requires that the victim be three years of age or less; the\nformer requires that the victim be over the age of three but less than the age of 13.\nBecause these two statutes each require a different element, i.e., a victim of a different\nage, rape of a child cannot be a lesser included offense of aggravated rape of a child. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-18-110(f)(1). Certainly, the instant offense does not involve facilitation,\n                                            -8-\n\fattempt, or solicitation nor has it been specifically designated by statute as a lesser\nincluded offense. See id., \u00a7 40-18-110(f)(2)-(4); (g)(1)-(4). Finally, a differing mental\nstate or lesser risk of harm is not applicable in the instant case. See Howard, 504 S.W.3d\nat 268.\n\n               Accordingly, no error attends the trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jury as to\nrape of a child.\n\n                              III. Correction of Clerical Error\n\n              Although not raised by either party, we detect an error that requires\ncorrection in the judgment. Based on the transcript of the sentencing hearing, the\ndefendant had no prior criminal history, and the prosecutor announced to the trial court\nthat the defendant was a \u201crange one, standard offender.\u201d The court and the parties all\nagreed that, by statute, the defendant must be sentenced as a Range III offender. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-531(b) (\u201cAggravated rape of a child is a Class A felony and shall be\nsentenced within Range III, as set forth in title 40, chapter 35.\u201d).\n\n               On the judgment form, however, the trial court checked the box for\n\u201cMultiple\u201d in the offender status section, although the court correctly checked the box for\n\u201cChild Rapist 100%\u201d in the release eligibility section. Without question, the defendant is\nnot a multiple offender, and although the defendant is considered a Range III offender by\nstatute due to the severity of the conviction, he is not a persistent offender. See T.C.A. \u00a7\n40-35-107(a). We believe the trial court was attempting to communicate that the\ndefendant was a Range III offender, and simply erroneously checked the box for\n\u201cMultiple\u201d rather than \u201cPersistent\u201d in the offender status section. However, no section on\nthe judgment form merely indicates a defendant\u2019s sentencing range. On remand, the trial\ncourt should amend the judgment to remove the multiple-offender designation and\nreplace it with an asterisk to direct the reader to the special conditions box. In that box,\nthe trial court should indicate that the defendant is deemed a Range III offender pursuant\nto the terms of T.C.A. \u00a7 39-15-531(b).\n\n             Accordingly, on remand, the trial court shall enter an amended judgment to\nremove the designation of offender status as \u201cMultiple.\u201d\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n              Based upon the foregoing analysis, the judgment of the trial court is\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\f          _________________________________\n         JAMES CURWOOD WITT, JR., JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n- 10 -\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                                                                                            05/23/2017\n\n\n\n\n        IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE\n                         AT KNOXVILLE\n                                   February 22, 2017 Session\n\n               STATE OF TENNESSEE v.

The trial court conducted a jury trial in\nJune 2015.\n\n            The State\u2019s proof at trial showed that the victim, C.H.,1 resided in Morgan\nCounty with his mother, A.H.,2 in September 2012. A.H. testified that the victim was\n\n1\n       It is the policy of this court to refer to minors by initials.\n2\n       To protect the anonymity of the minor victim, we will refer to his mother by her initials as well.\n\fborn on December 17, 2009, and that he was three months shy of his third birthday on\nSeptember 10, 2012.\n\n              A few days prior to September 10, the victim was accidentally run over by\na vehicle in a library parking lot but fortunately sustained only minor injuries. On\nSeptember 10, the defendant paid a visit to A.H.\u2019s residence to \u201ccheck on\u201d the victim\u2019s\nwell-being. The defendant sat on the floor of the living room and helped the victim play\nwith some toy trucks. After a few minutes, the victim decided to play in his bedroom,\nand the defendant asked A.H. if he could assist the victim in carrying the toys to the\nvictim\u2019s bedroom; A.H. acquiesced and followed them. While A.H. was standing outside\nof the victim\u2019s bedroom, her husband requested her assistance in locating an item, and\nA.H. walked away \u201cfor maybe a minute, minute and a half.\u201d When she returned to the\nvictim\u2019s bedroom, she saw the defendant \u201csticking his [penis] in my kid[\u2019]s mouth.\u201d\nA.H. stated that the defendant had one of his hands on the victim\u2019s head and that he was\nusing his other hand to hold his penis.\n\n               A.H. testified that she immediately \u201cstarted screaming,\u201d and the defendant\nreplied that he \u201cwasn\u2019t doing nothing,\u201d although A.H. could \u201cclearly see his pants were\nunbuttoned.\u201d A.H.\u2019s husband \u201chad to force [the defendant] out of the whole house,\u201d and\nthe defendant was \u201cscreaming I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d When police\nofficers arrived at the house, the defendant continued \u201cscreaming I\u2019m not right in the\nhead, I didn\u2019t mean to, I wasn\u2019t right, I didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d\n\n               A.H. admitted that she had been previously convicted of attempted forgery,\nmisdemeanor theft, misdemeanor criminal impersonation, and possession of less than half\na gram of methamphetamine and that she was currently serving a jail sentence in\nCumberland County. A.H. clarified that all of her criminal convictions had occurred after\nthe rape of the victim.\n\n              On cross-examination, A.H. stated that, when she reentered the victim\u2019s\nbedroom, the defendant was on his knees, and A.H. was adamant that she saw the\ndefendant\u2019s penis inside the victim\u2019s mouth. A.H. denied using any drugs on September\n10, 2012, and testified that she did not begin using methamphetamine until after the\nvictim\u2019s rape. A.H. denied that the victim had a history of grabbing men in the crotch.\nA.H. confirmed that she had contacted Mark and Linda Peterson shortly after the rape\noccurred, explaining that she had met the defendant through the Petersons and that she\nwanted to inform them of what had transpired because the defendant \u201cwould slip off into\nthe bedroom\u201d with the Petersons\u2019 children on prior occasions.\n\n             Morgan County Sheriff\u2019s Department (\u201cMCSD\u201d) Chief Deputy Steve\nCochran testified that he interviewed the defendant on September 12, 2012. Chief\n                                          -2-\n\fCochran provided the defendant with his Miranda warnings, and the defendant signed a\nwaiver of his rights and agreed to speak with Chief Cochran. At that time, the defendant\nadmitted that he had placed his penis in the victim\u2019s mouth. Chief Cochran asked the\ndefendant \u201cwhat made [him] excited . . . about the child,\u201d and the defendant replied that\n\u201che was excited and turned on by\u201d seeing the victim \u201cin his diaper.\u201d The defendant\ndenied that he had committed any other sexual assaults or that \u201clittle boys turned him on\u201d\nprior to his assault of the victim. Following the interview, Chief Cochran asked the\ndefendant to give a handwritten statement, and the defendant complied, writing that he\n\u201cwent to his bedroom to play with him then after [I] played with him [I] stuck my penis\nin his mouth.\u201d\n\n              On cross-examination, Chief Cochran admitted that no video or audio\nrecording of his interview with the defendant existed. Chief Cochran acknowledged that\nhe did not inquire about the defendant\u2019s educational background but stated that he had\nread the Miranda warnings aloud to the defendant \u201cjust in case\u201d the defendant was unable\nto read. Chief Cochran conceded that the defendant had not signed his handwritten\nstatement, which was on the back side of the rights waiver form which he had signed.\n\n              On redirect examination, Chief Cochran stated that he had given\n\u201chundreds\u201d of interviews and Miranda warnings throughout his career in law\nenforcement and that he was able to discern when an interviewee understands the\nquestions being asked of him. Chief Cochran had \u201cno question\u201d about the defendant\u2019s\nability to understand his rights.\n\n              Kingston Police Department Officer Brian Luttrell testified that in\nSeptember 2012 he was employed as an MCSD corrections officer. Officer Luttrell was\npresent during Chief Cochran\u2019s interview of the defendant, and he described the\ndefendant\u2019s statements as follows:\n\n                    He stated that the little boy had been in an accident,\n             was injured and had just got home from the hospital. He went\n             over to see him. He went into the back room and was playing\n             with him, I think with some toy cars. And they were back\n             there by their self [sic]. He stated that the little boy being\n             injured and he was wearing a t-shirt and a diaper and that, in\n             some way, aroused him. Then he forced himself into the little\n             boy\u2019s mouth.\n\n                    ....\n\n                    He forced his penis into the little boy\u2019s mouth.\n                                           -3-\n\fOfficer Luttrell testified that he witnessed the defendant\u2019s signing of the rights waiver\nform and that he was present when the defendant handwrote his statement.\n\n              With this evidence, the State rested. The defendant then elected to testify\nand to present proof.\n\n              Kathy Bolden, the defendant\u2019s mother, testified that the defendant suffered\nfrom a learning disability, explaining that he \u201chad to have special learning all the way\nthrough school\u201d and had received \u201ca special learning diploma.\u201d Ms. Bolden elaborated,\nexplaining that \u201c[y]ou have to keep telling him in detail what you want him to do\u201d and\nthat, in school, he struggled with \u201ccomprehension and speech.\u201d Ms. Bolden testified that\nthe defendant disliked conflict and violence and that she was unaware of any prior history\nof sexual assault on the defendant\u2019s part.\n\n               Rob Wall, Ms. Bolden\u2019s boyfriend, described himself as a pseudo-\nstepfather to the defendant. Mr. Wall testified that the defendant was \u201ca little slow\u201d and\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t comprehend things\u201d quickly. On cross-examination, both Mr. Wall and Ms.\nBolden testified that the defendant knew the difference between right and wrong.\n\n               Steven Bolden, the defendant\u2019s younger brother, testified that the defendant\nwas \u201ca little autistic\u201d and had \u201ca short fuse\u201d with respect to conflict. Mr. Bolden recalled\none occasion on which the victim had \u201cgrabbed\u201d him by \u201chis privates.\u201d\n\n              Linda Peterson testified that she had become acquainted with the defendant\nwhen Steven Bolden began dating Ms. Peterson\u2019s roommate. Ms. Peterson stated that\nshe did not know the defendant \u201cthat well,\u201d explaining that he had visited her house on\nprior occasions and that he had played with her children. Ms. Peterson explained that the\nvictim was a year younger than her youngest child and stated that the victim \u201ccouldn\u2019t\ntalk\u201d and would \u201chit\u201d people to get what he wanted. Ms. Peterson testified that she had\nobserved the victim strike people in the crotch on prior occasions.\n\n               With respect to the victim\u2019s rape, Ms. Peterson recalled that A.H. had\ncalled her on September 10 to inform her that the defendant \u201chad molested\u201d the victim.\nAccording to Ms. Peterson, A.H. was hysterical and told her that she had seen the victim\n\u201cright at [the defendant\u2019s] crotch area.\u201d Ms. Peterson stated that, after the rape, A.H. was\ninconsistent in her description of the assault:\n\n                      One time he\u2019s on his knees. The next time he was\n              standing up. It didn\u2019t happen, it did happen. She never could\n              tell the same story.\n                                            -4-\n\f               The defendant testified and categorically denied engaging in any sexual\ncontact with the victim. According to the defendant, he had been at the local library on\nSeptember 10, 2012, conducting research on a \u201ctruck driving job\u201d when he noticed A.H.\nat the library. As he was walking home, it occurred to him that he should speak with\nA.H.\u2019s husband about a job, so he walked to A.H.\u2019s residence. Upon his arrival, he\nencountered A.H. standing by her mailbox. She told him about the victim\u2019s recent\naccident and asked the defendant if he would like to see the victim. The defendant said\nthat he would, explaining to the jury that he \u201cused that excuse to ask [A.H.\u2019s husband]\nabout\u201d a job.\n\n              Once inside, the defendant sat in the living room and chatted with A.H.\nwhile the victim played in the floor and A.H.\u2019s husband sat nearby. Because A.H.\u2019s\nhusband \u201cnever spoke\u201d to the defendant, the defendant became uncomfortable and asked\nA.H. if he \u201ccould go check on the little boy\u2019s toys.\u201d A.H. responded in the affirmative,\nand the defendant proceeded to the victim\u2019s bedroom. While the victim was playing on\nthe floor with his toys, the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone \u201cvibrated,\u201d and the defendant\nremoved the telephone from his pocket. Upon spotting the telephone, the victim\nadvanced toward the defendant and attempted to grab the telephone but missed and struck\nthe defendant in the area of his crotch. The defendant moved the victim\u2019s hand away and\ninstructed him not to do that again. The victim then sat down in the floor, resumed\nplaying, and pointed to the upper area of the closet where the victim\u2019s trucks were\nlocated. When the defendant was attempting to retrieve the trucks, A.H. appeared. She\nremoved the victim from the bedroom, and her husband \u201cescorted\u201d the defendant from\nthe house. A.H. then walked outside while speaking on her cellular telephone, stating\nthat the defendant was \u201cdown here trying to put his [penis] in [the victim\u2019s] mouth.\u201d\n\n              When the defendant arrived at the jail, officers forced him \u201cto strip down in\nfront of a bunch of people\u201d and informed him that he was being charged with aggravated\nrape of a child; he testified that he did not know what \u201caggravated\u201d meant at that time.\nThe defendant claimed that Officer Luttrell \u201charass[ed him] verbally\u201d throughout the\nnight. When Officer Luttrell brought him to Chief Cochran\u2019s office, Chief Cochran read\nthe Miranda rights to the defendant and asked him if he understood his rights. The\ndefendant testified that he did not respond because he was \u201cso scared.\u201d He stated that he\nwrote the statement for the officers \u201cout of fear, not guilt,\u201d believing that the officers\n\u201cwould leave [him] alone.\u201d The defendant testified that he merely wrote a statement of\nwhat he was being accused of rather than what had actually transpired.\n\n             Chief Cochran testified on rebuttal for the State and denied telling the\ndefendant what to write in his statement. Chief Cochran stated that the defendant never\ndenied assaulting the victim and that the defendant even volunteered the detail about the\n                                           -5-\n\fvictim\u2019s diaper causing him to be aroused. With respect to the defendant\u2019s claim that\nOfficer Luttrell had verbally harassed him, Chief Cochran explained that Officer Luttrell\ncould not have worked an overnight shift at the jail and then been present the following\nmorning to assist in the the defendant\u2019s interview.\n\n              Based on this evidence, the jury convicted the defendant as charged of one\ncount of aggravated rape of a child. Following a sentencing hearing, the trial court\nsentenced the defendant as a deemed Range III offender to a term of 40 years\u2019\nincarceration to be served at 100 percent by operation of law.\n\n               Following the denial of his timely motion for new trial, the defendant filed\na timely notice of appeal. In this appeal, the defendant contends that the evidence is\ninsufficient to support his conviction and that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the\njury on rape of a child as a lesser included offense. We will address each issue in turn.\n\n                                        I. Sufficiency\n\n              The defendant first contends that the evidence is insufficient to support his\nconviction of aggravated rape of a child. We disagree.\n\n              We review the defendant\u2019s claim of insufficient evidence mindful that our\nstandard of review is whether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt.

Id.\nQuestions concerning the credibility of the witnesses, the weight and value of the\nevidence, as well as all factual issues raised by the evidence are resolved by the trier of\nfact. State v. Cabbage, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443840\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443840/state-v-cabbage/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 835 (Tenn. 1978). Significantly, this court must\nafford the State the strongest legitimate view of the evidence contained in the record as\nwell as all reasonable and legitimate inferences which may be drawn from the evidence.\nId.\n\n              As charged in this case, \u201c[a]ggravated rape of a child is the unlawful sexual\npenetration of a victim by the defendant or the defendant by a victim if the victim is three\n(3) years of age or less.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-531(a). \u201cSexual penetration\u201d is defined as\n                                              -6-\n\f\u201csexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any other intrusion,\nhowever slight, of any part of a person\u2019s body or of any object into the genital or anal\nopenings of the victim\u2019s, the defendant\u2019s, or any other person\u2019s body, but emission of\nsemen is not required.\u201d Id. \u00a7 39-13-501(7).\n\n              In the instant case, the proof at trial established that the defendant inserted\nhis penis into the two-year-old victim\u2019s mouth. A.H. testified that she witnessed this\nassault, and the defendant admitted to Chief Cochran and Officer Luttrell that he had\nbecome \u201caroused\u201d by the sight of the toddler in a diaper, resulting in his placing his penis\ninside the victim\u2019s mouth. Although the defendant denied the rape and claimed that he\nwas \u201cintimidated\u201d into confessing to the crime, such matters of witness credibility and\nevidentiary weight are within the exclusive province of the trier of fact, and this court\nwill not reweigh such evidence. See Dorantes, 331 S.W.3d at 379.\n\n               The defendant primarily takes issue with the evidence of the victim\u2019s age,\nclaiming that \u201cthere was minimal and somewhat conflicting evidence of the age of the\nchild at the time of the incident.\u201d To the contrary, the victim\u2019s mother, A.H., testified\nthat the victim was born on December 17, 2009; thus, the victim was one week shy of\ntwo years and nine months when the rape occurred on September 10, 2012. Furthermore,\na review of the trial transcript reveals that A.H. referenced the victim\u2019s being two years\nof age no less than nine times during the course of her testimony.\n\n              Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we\nfind that the evidence adduced at trial overwhelmingly supports the defendant\u2019s\nconviction of aggravated rape of a child.\n\n                                     II. Jury Instruction\n\n               The defendant contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the\njury \u201con the lesser included offense of Rape of a Child.\u201d Again, we disagree.\n\n              Nothing in the record suggests that the defendant contemporaneously\nobjected to the trial court\u2019s failure to include an instruction on rape of a child, and thus,\nhe has waived our consideration of this issue. A defendant complaining of the omission\nof an instruction must make a special request that the instruction be given or otherwise\nobject to the omission. See Tenn. R. Crim. P. 30(a), (b); State v.

Crim. App. 1993).\n\n                Furthermore, the scant reference to jury instructions in the trial transcript\nreveals that both the State and the defense agreed on the pertinent instructions to be\ngiven. Just prior to the return of the jury to the courtroom and the reading of the verdict,\nthe trial court made the following announcement:\n\n                     All right, for the record we had a chambers meeting\n              going over the jury instructions for this case and determined\n              that with both sides that the proper charge would be the\n              Aggravated Rape Of A Child, and as a lesser included\n              Aggravated Sexual Battery. And that that would complete\n              the part on the charge.\n\n              In any event, an instruction on rape of a child would have been improper in\nthis case because rape of a child is not a lesser included offense of aggravated rape of a\nchild. An offense is considered a lesser included offense if it contains all of the statutory\nelements of the offense charged, if it involves the facilitation, attempt, or solicitation of\nthe offense charged, or if it is specifically designated as a lesser included offense by\nstatute. T.C.A. \u00a7 40-18-110(f). In addition, an offense is lesser included if it differs from\nthe charged offense only in that it requires a less culpable mental state or requires a less\nserious harm or risk of harm to the same victim. See State v. Howard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n268-75 (Tenn. 2016) (citing State v. Burns, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2277242\"><a href=\"/opinion/2277242/state-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1999)).\n\n               Here, the defendant was convicted of aggravated rape of a child, which is\ndefined as \u201cthe unlawful sexual penetration of a victim by the defendant or the defendant\nby a victim, if the victim is three (3) years of age or less.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-531(a). Rape\nof a child is defined as \u201cthe unlawful sexual penetration of a victim by the defendant or\nthe defendant by the victim, if the victim is more than three (3) years of age but less than\nthirteen (13) years of age.\u201d T.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-522(a).\n\n              Clearly, rape of a child is not a lesser included offense of aggravated rape\nof a child. The latter offense requires that the victim be three years of age or less; the\nformer requires that the victim be over the age of three but less than the age of 13.\nBecause these two statutes each require a different element, i.e., a victim of a different\nage, rape of a child cannot be a lesser included offense of aggravated rape of a child. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 40-18-110(f)(1). Certainly, the instant offense does not involve facilitation,\n                                            -8-\n\fattempt, or solicitation nor has it been specifically designated by statute as a lesser\nincluded offense. See id., \u00a7 40-18-110(f)(2)-(4); (g)(1)-(4). Finally, a differing mental\nstate or lesser risk of harm is not applicable in the instant case. See Howard, 504 S.W.3d\nat 268.\n\n               Accordingly, no error attends the trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jury as to\nrape of a child.\n\n                              III. Correction of Clerical Error\n\n              Although not raised by either party, we detect an error that requires\ncorrection in the judgment. Based on the transcript of the sentencing hearing, the\ndefendant had no prior criminal history, and the prosecutor announced to the trial court\nthat the defendant was a \u201crange one, standard offender.\u201d The court and the parties all\nagreed that, by statute, the defendant must be sentenced as a Range III offender. See\nT.C.A. \u00a7 39-13-531(b) (\u201cAggravated rape of a child is a Class A felony and shall be\nsentenced within Range III, as set forth in title 40, chapter 35.\u201d).\n\n               On the judgment form, however, the trial court checked the box for\n\u201cMultiple\u201d in the offender status section, although the court correctly checked the box for\n\u201cChild Rapist 100%\u201d in the release eligibility section. Without question, the defendant is\nnot a multiple offender, and although the defendant is considered a Range III offender by\nstatute due to the severity of the conviction, he is not a persistent offender. See T.C.A. \u00a7\n40-35-107(a). We believe the trial court was attempting to communicate that the\ndefendant was a Range III offender, and simply erroneously checked the box for\n\u201cMultiple\u201d rather than \u201cPersistent\u201d in the offender status section. However, no section on\nthe judgment form merely indicates a defendant\u2019s sentencing range. On remand, the trial\ncourt should amend the judgment to remove the multiple-offender designation and\nreplace it with an asterisk to direct the reader to the special conditions box. In that box,\nthe trial court should indicate that the defendant is deemed a Range III offender pursuant\nto the terms of T.C.A. \u00a7 39-15-531(b).\n\n             Accordingly, on remand, the trial court shall enter an amended judgment to\nremove the designation of offender status as \u201cMultiple.\u201d\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n              Based upon the foregoing analysis, the judgment of the trial court is\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\f          _________________________________\n         JAMES CURWOOD WITT, JR., JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n- 10 -\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
