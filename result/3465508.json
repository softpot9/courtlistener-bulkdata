Holley obtained judgment in the district court of Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, against W.A. Owens in the sum of $1,174. After this judgment became final Holley had issued a fieri facias and the sheriff seized the automobile in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, where Owens had taken it and the car was advertised for sale to satisfy the judgment held by Holley.</p>\n<p>Universal Credit Company then filed an intervention alleging that Owens had paid all installments on the car as they became due up to and including the installment note due June 1, 1939; that he failed to pay the installment due July 1, 1939, and it had exercised its option of declaring all remaining notes or installments presently due and exigible; that the balance due is $346.50, with interest on $31.50 from July 1, 1939, until July 3, 1939, and with interest on $346.50 from July 3, 1939, until paid and 15% additional on such amounts as attorney's fees.</p>\n<p>It set out the transaction whereby Ashley purchased the car and gave the mortgage and alleged that he later assigned his equity in the car to W.A. Owens. It claimed a preference and priority on the proceeds to be derived from the sale under the fieri facias issued by Holley by reason of the original chattel mortgage recorded against Ashley in Webster Parish, Louisiana. It admitted that the instrument whereby Owens acquired the car was not recorded in Claiborne Parish, the domicile of Owens.</p>\n<p>The mortgage executed by Ashley to the Andress Motor Company, Inc., does not purport to be a notarial act but to be a private act executed before two witnesses and duly acknowledged before a notary public by one of said witnesses.</p>\n<p>Defendant in reconvention, hereafter referred to as defendant, attacks the said mortgage as not being authentic or confected in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 178 of 1936, which amends Section 2 as amended by Act No. 189 of 1932; and Sections 4 and 5 of Act No. 198 of 1918, as amended by Act No. 81 of 1922 and Act No. 232 of 1924 and, therefore, can have no effect on third persons without notice.</p>\n<p>Defendant further contends that intervenor's failure to record the instrument whereby the car was transferred from Ashley to Owens, which instrument is quoted in full above, deprived it of any right or preference against or over a third person without notice. It is admitted that defendant was without notice of either of the transactions of sale and assignment. Defendant also denied that Owens was indebted unto intervenor in any amount.</p>\n<p>The lower court awarded judgment for intervenor as prayed for, recognizing its privilege on the proceeds derived from the sale of the car and ordered the sheriff to pay over to it the funds derived therefrom in preference and with priority over all other claims, and especially the claim of defendant herein. Defendant is now prosecuting this appeal.</p>\n<p>Intervenor claims in its petition that there is a balance due of $346.50 under the chattel mortgage. It also alleged that Owens had made all payments as they became due until July 1, 1939. According to the chattel mortgage and notes, there were only three payments of $38.45 each due on and after that date, which would have made a total of $115.35, however, defendant, by stipulation during the trial of the case has admitted the correctness of the amount claimed by intervenor and that it is the balance due under the chattel mortgage and dispensed with proof thereon.</p>\n<p>We are at a loss to know what the difference between $115.35 and $346.50 consisted of. Clearly it is not due under the pleadings and chattel mortgage attached thereto. However, since defendant admitted it, we feel sure it must be due and the pleadings must have been erroneous and allowed to be corrected by the admission, but there is nothing in the record to justify such an assumption by us.</p>\n<p>Defendant's attack on the authenticity of the chattel mortgage executed by Ashley is levelled at the witnesses whose signatures appear thereon. It is defendant's contention that they were not present and did not witness Ashley sign the instrument. H.C. Andress, manager of the mortgagee corporation, and the witness, Miss Deloney, both testified that Miss Deloney was present and saw Ashley sign the document. Ashley, whose interest was to have intervenor recover in this suit for the reason he has made himself at least the guarantor of Owens and promised to pay the notes if Owens did not, testified that no one other than H.C. Andress was present when the mortgage was executed by him and that never until the day of trial had <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 46</span> \nhe seen Miss Deloney. Ashley further testified that the other witness, C.S. Adkins, was not present when he executed the instrument. No evidence was offered by intervenor to contradict this testimony, therefore, under the testimony, it is clear that the acknowledgment made by Miss Deloney before the Notary wherein she deposes and says that she saw the mortgage executed by the mortgagor in the presence of both the witnesses is incorrect.</p>\n<p>Section 2 of Act No. 178 of 1936 provides in part as follows: \"In order to affect third persons * * * said instrument must be passed by notarial act, or by private act duly acknowledged by one of the parties thereto, or by a subscribing witness thereto, before a Notary Public * * *.\"</p>\n<p>A private act is good as between the parties thereto without any witnesses and the above-quoted provision of Act No. 178 of 1936 makes it good and binding as to third persons if one witness duly acknowledged it before a notary public. Therefore, if we find that the acknowledging witness was actually at the execution of the instrument, it would seem to meet the requirements of the Act. The lower court found this to be a fact and under the testimony we would not be justified in disagreeing with it.</p>\n<p>The second contention made by defendant presents a rather novel and new question for determination: Was it necessary for intervenor to have had recorded in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, the domicile of Owens, the instrument by which Owens assumed the indebtedness of Ashley under the original chattel mortgage, which instrument is quoted in full above?</p>\n<p>This instrument, dated May 27, 1938, transfers the automobile from Ashley to Owens and Owens agreed to pay the balance due as represented by the mortgage and assume the mortgage. By this act he became the mortgagor and the Andress Motor Company, Inc., the mortgagee. There was a change of ownership of the automobile and a change of mortgagor with the written consent of the mortgagee and the intervenor herein, the holder of the notes and contract in due course. It is true that the original mortgagor in this document bound himself to pay if the new mortgagor, Owens, did not. The instrument not only changed the ownership of the car and substituted a new mortgagor for the original one, but it also changed the due date of the fifteen remaining monthly payments from the 25th day of each month to the 1st of each month. The instrument on its face shows that the substituted mortgagor was a resident of Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, and the original mortgagor a resident of Webster Parish, Louisiana.</p>\n<p>When the above instrument was executed, Owens became the mortgagor just the same as if a new mortgage had been drawn and executed by Owens to the seller or holder of the notes, and the instrument takes the place of a new mortgage and, in our opinion, is governed by the provisions of Section 2 of Act No. 178 of 1936 and, therefore, to have been effective against third persons without notice, it was necessary that it be recorded in Webster Parish, Louisiana, where the sale took place and in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana, the domicile of the purchaser and mortgagor. This was not done.</p>\n<p>It therefore follows that the judgment of the lower court is erroneous and it is now reversed and the demands of intervenor are rejected at its costs in both courts. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 197</span> </p>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
