The district court properly admitted the identification of Walker by\n\nOfficer Griffin and Sergeant Do under Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 701.\n\nBoth witnesses had sufficient prior contacts with Walker to render their\n\nidentifications helpful to the jury, and the evidence was more probative than\n\nprejudicial.

There was no Confrontation Clause violation in this case because the\n\nidentification testimony was not testimonial, and Walker had a full opportunity to\n\ncross-examine both witnesses.
