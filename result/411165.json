We now issue the following opinion in place of the earlier one;  we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n      <p>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff-appellant, Carole Hyman Burstein, is a Louisiana resident licensed to practice law in that state.  She took the California bar examination in July, 1979.  When the results were final, the Bar notified her that she had failed both the multiple-choice multistate portion and the essay portion of the test.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burstein believed that her failure must have resulted from an error in grading, so she wrote to the Bar requesting regrading.  The Bar replied that a check of her examination revealed no scoring errors.  Burstein then wrote two letters to the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, again requesting review of her examination.  An assistant to the Chief Justice responded that the court did not intervene in individual grading decisions, and referred her back to the Bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burstein then filed this suit against the Bar<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in federal district court in Louisiana.  Process was served under the Louisiana long-arm statute, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 13:3201 (West 1968 &amp; Supp.1982).  She alleged violation of her rights to due process and equal protection, giving rise to the cause of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980) provided for by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1343 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980).  She also alleged diversity claims of negligence and breach of contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gravamen of her complaint was that she believed that the Educational Testing Service, which graded the multistate examination, had assigned her someone else's score through computer error.  Further, she alleged that the multistate score was given to the essay graders before they read her paper, and the fact that the multistate score was so low led them to fail her on the essay portion either without reading her paper or after only a cursory review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the Bar alleged a variety of grounds for dismissal, of which the only one relevant here is lack of personal jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   The court ordered that discovery be restricted to facts relevant to personal and subject-matter jurisdiction;  Burstein served eight interrogatories on the Bar.  It answered four, but refused to answer the others.  The court declined to compel discovery and granted the Bar's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burstein raises several contentions here.  We will discuss her arguments that there was personal jurisdiction and, alternatively, that dismissal was premature because of the denial of discovery.  Because we accept neither of these arguments, we affirm the dismissal;  it is therefore unnecessary to proceed to Burstein's request for summary judgment in her favor or for an order limiting the Bar's other procedural defenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>II. PERSONAL JURISDICTION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The starting point for our inquiry is the realization that a federal court may only exercise personal jurisdiction if it is authorized to do so by law and such exercise does not violate the Constitution.  In a federal question case in federal court, the relevant constitutional provision is the due process clause of the fifth amendment, a provision whose application in this context is not well defined.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>   Fortunately, we need not reach that problem, since we find that personal jurisdiction in this case is not authorized by the applicable law, i.e., section 1983 and Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to present our analysis clearly, we first undertake an explication of the provisions of rule 4(e).  We then explain and harmonize the relevant Fifth Circuit cases;  finally, we apply the standard thus developed to the facts of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Rule 4(e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 provides for service of process in cases brought in federal court.  While by its terms rule 4(d) might well apply to this case, it is clear that rule 4(e) is designed for use to obtain service on parties not resident within the forum state, and by negative implication it excludes rule 4(d).  See 2 J. Moore, J. Lucas, H. Fink, &amp; C. Thompson, Moore's Federal Practice paragraphs 4.32, 4.41-1 (1982).  We thus direct our attention solely to rule 4(e), which has three provisions relevant to our analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first part of the first sentence of rule 4(e) applies \"[w]henever a statute of the United States ... provides for service of a summons ... upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state in which the district court is held ...\" and the federal statute or a court order thereunder prescribes a manner of service.  Jurisdiction is then asserted by the federal statute and service is made \"under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by the statute or order ....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second part of the first sentence applies when a federal statute provides for service, thus asserting jurisdiction, but does not prescribe the manner of service.  In that case, \"service may be made ... in a manner stated in this rule,\" i.e., rule 4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither one of these provisions applies to this case, because neither section 1983 nor section 1343 even \"provides\" for service.  It is thus necessary to examine the second sentence of rule 4(e), which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Whenever a statute ... of the state in which the district court is held provides ... for service of a summons ... upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the state, ... service may ... be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the statute....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clear import of the \"under the circumstances\" language, at least where the assertion of jurisdiction and not just the service of process depends on the state statute, is that a federal court, even in a federal question case, can use a state long-arm statute only to reach those parties whom a court of the state could also reach under it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that this is the same conclusion reached by a leading commentator:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On balance, then, it would seem that state law always should govern amenability when a state statute is used pursuant to rule 4(e).  Although the opposite result has some appeal in that it permits effectuation of federal interests in a broader range of suits, it is inconsistent with the apparent intent of the draftsmen of rule 4(e) to use state provisions for service in order to permit the federal courts in a state to hear those cases that could be brought in the state's own courts when a basis for asserting federal subject matter jurisdiction exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, Sec. 1075 at 313 (1969).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

None of them is inconsistent with the result here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The earliest of these cases is Lone Star Package Car Co. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"233852\"><a href=\"/opinion/233852/lone-star-package-car-co-inc-v-baltimore-o-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1954).    Lone Star, a suit filed in a district court in Texas, involved both a diversity claim and a claim under the Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 20.  Lone Star filed a third-party complaint against the B &amp; O Railroad, and service was made on the B &amp; O's agents in Texas.  The Fifth Circuit upheld personal jurisdiction over the B &amp; O, with a broad statement that in a federal question case the court was not bound by limitations on state courts, there by the requirement that the B &amp; O be \"doing business\" in Texas.  The Lone Star court stated that \"insofar as cases are governed by federal law, the question of whether they are to be tried in one locality or another is now to be tested ... simply by basic principles of fairness.

State of Washington, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span> [<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus Lone Star neither controls nor is inconsistent with this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only last year, the Fifth Circuit decided Federal Trade Commission v. Jim Walter Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391207\"><a href=\"/opinion/391207/federal-trade-commission-v-jim-walter-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1981).  In that case, suit was filed in the Northern District of Texas and process was served on the defendant in Florida, so rule 4(e) did apply.  The cause of action, however, was under section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 49 (1976), which has been interpreted as authorizing nationwide service of process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   Thus, as the Jim Walter Corp. court noted, the relevant portion of rule 4(e) was the first sentence.  651 F.2d at 254.  The court went on to hold that under those circumstances, the only \"minimum contacts\" required by due process were contacts with the United States, not Texas.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>   Again, however, Jim Walter Corp. did not involve the second sentence of rule 4(e), and thus does not control this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Terry v.

One defendant filed a third-party complaint against the other, and served it on the third-party defendant's only employee in Louisiana, the state where the district court sat.  The Terry court held that amenability to jurisdiction must be measured under federal, not state, law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> and that service was proper under rule 4(d)(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rested its holding that amenability was to be measured by a federal standard on Lone Star, another rule 4(d)(7) case.  It must again be stressed that rule 4(d)(7) only requires that service be made \"in the manner\" prescribed by state law, not \"under the circumstances\" so prescribed.  Given rule 4(e)'s carefully drawn distinction between the assertion of jurisdiction by a federal statute and by a state statute,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> we do not believe Terry's language extends to a case where assertion of jurisdiction is made only under the state long-arm statute.  In such a case, amenability must be measured by the state standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final Fifth Circuit case that merits discussion is Black v. Acme Markets, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350112\"><a href=\"/opinion/350112/a-l-black-v-acme-markets-inc-first-national-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1977).  It involved an antitrust suit filed in Texas, with service on the Texas Secretary of State and by mail in Massachusetts on the defendant, both under the Texas long-arm statute.  The Black court noted that, since section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 22 (1976), provided for nationwide service of process, the only question to which state law was relevant was the propriety of the manner of service.  The court looked to the first sentence of rule 4(e), since there was a federal statute providing for service, and observed that the case fell into the category of cases where the federal statute provides for service but does not supply a method for it.  Rule 4(e) states that in such cases \"service may be made ... in a manner stated in this rule ...,\" i.e., rule 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then referred to rule 4(d)(7), which authorizes service on a corporation \"in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the district court is held ....\"  It observed that, because rule 4(d)(7) does not have the \"under the circumstances\" language of rule 4(e), a plausible reading of the rule would allow the court to apply the long-arm statute without regard to the state limitations on its use;  however, the court found it unnecessary to decide the question, because it held that Texas courts could have used the long-arm to reach the defendant in the case.  564 F.2d at 685 &amp; n. 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This analysis is totally consistent with ours, because Black involved the first sentence of rule 4(e), not the second.  The Black court specifically observed that the provision of the first sentence of rule 4(e) that applies when the federal statute supplies no manner of service only required service \"in a manner stated in this rule\" and that rule 4(d)(7) only required service to be \"in the manner prescribed by\" state law, \"without reference to the circumstances required under state law.\"    564 F.2d at 685 n. 5 (emphasis in original).  Such is clearly not the case when the second sentence of rule 4(e) is used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude that personal jurisdiction over the Bar in this case is proper only if a Louisiana court could have asserted it.

We believe that neither case compels a conclusion in her favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cousteau, the Texas plaintiff had visited the defendant in France, and they subsequently concluded a contract by mail.  The defendant agreed to test a product of the plaintiff's and film the tests, with the results and film to be shipped to the plaintiff in Texas.  The plaintiff began to market the items with advertising claiming that the defendant's alleged principal, Jacques Cousteau, had endorsed them.  The defendant persuaded the plaintiff's retailer to stop selling them because of the allegedly unauthorized advertising;  the plaintiff sued the defendant in federal court in Texas for breach of contract and various torts.  The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's finding of no personal jurisdiction over the defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We believe, however, that Cousteau is distinguishable on its facts.  In the first place, there was clearly a contract in Cousteau;  the existence of a contract in this case is highly debatable.  Further, the contract in Cousteau became effective upon the mailing of the plaintiff's acceptance from Texas;  even if there is a contract here, it is unclear whether it became effective upon Burstein's mailing of the application and fee from Louisiana, upon the Bar's finding that she passed the character examination, upon her arrival at the testing place in California on the proper day, or at some other time.  Moreover, the performance the Cousteau contract required of the defendant in Texas was delivery of the film and reports, an integral element of a contract for goods and services.  Delivery of Burstein's bar examination results to Louisiana was not such an integral element of the Bar's performance of the alleged contract, which was purely for services.  The Cousteaucourt found that Texas law might well govern the interpretation of the contract;  it seems most unlikely that Louisiana law would control the interpretation of any contract in this case.  In short, the \"substantial connection\" with and likely consequences in Texas of the Cousteau contract, 495 F.2d at 497, are wholly absent from this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its consideration of the application of general principles of fairness to the facts in Cousteau,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> the court noted that Texas had a \"legitimate and reasonable interest in providing a forum for [the] suit,\" because there was \"a rational nexus between this lawsuit and a Texas forum.\"   Id. at 498 (footnotes omitted).  No such nexus is apparent here.  As will be discussed infra, Louisiana's interest in providing a forum for this suit is minimal.  Since we find such substantial factual differences, we believe Cousteau does not control this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we find McGee, supra, inapplicable.  In McGee, the Texas defendant's sole connection with the California forum was the mailing to the decedent at his California home of an offer to renew a life insurance contract.  The Supreme Court upheld the California courts' jurisdiction over the subsequent suit on the insurance contract by the plaintiff beneficiary.  The Court's analysis took note of the fact that the contract had a \"substantial connection\" with California.  355 U.S. at 223, 78 S.Ct. at 201.  This substantial connection arose from several facts:  the contract was delivered in California, the premiums were mailed from there, and the insured died there;  further, California had a \"manifest interest\" in seeing that California residents got the benefits of their insurance contracts.  Id.  The Court observed that the Californians, usually holders of small claims, might be unable to pursue nonresident insurers to their home states and that the crucial witnesses in such suits would often be found in California.  The Court thus held that any inconvenience to the defendant in having the suit in California did not amount to a denial of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final relevant aspect of the facts of McGee is that California had expressed its interest in being the forum for such suits by passing a special statute to authorize service of process on nonresident insurers.   Id. at 221, 78 S.Ct. at 200.  While it is not clear whether the McGee Court relied on that fact, the Supreme Court has subsequently noted it in distinguishing McGee from other cases.   See Kulko v.

In McGee, the defendant solicited the contract;  here, Burstein had to take the initial step of seeking an application.  There was no delivery of the contract (if any) in this case.  It is true that Burstein mailed the application fee from Louisiana, but that is not a precise analogy to the premium mailing, since the premiums were the only performance required of the decedent in McGee, while Burstein, at least before the Bar could be required to admit her to practice, had to take and pass the examination.  Certainly Louisiana's interest in insuring that those few of its residents who take out-of-state bar examinations have them graded fairly is much less substantial than California's interest in preventing out-of-state insurance companies from wrongfully refusing to pay the claims of California residents.  There is no analog here to the California service of process statute used in McGee.    Finally, any witnesses necessary to Burstein's suit (or any Louisianan's suit against an out-of-state bar association) will not be in Louisiana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only factor favoring jurisdiction in McGee that is clearly present here is that Burstein may be financially unable to pursue the Bar to California.  We decline to predicate jurisdiction solely on that circumstance.  We thus find that the alleged breach of contract alone does not justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Alleged Tort.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burstein also alleges that the Bar negligently graded her examination in breach of a duty of care it owed to her, and that the resulting injury to her in Louisiana will permit this court to find personal jurisdiction over the defendant.  While this theory has some surface plausibility,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> it founders on the fact that there is absolutely no evidence that Burstein suffered any harm in Louisiana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming that there was a duty owed her and that the Bar breached it, the sole resulting harm is that Burstein cannot practice law in California.  She has not alleged any injury to her professional reputation in Louisiana, nor any decrease in her law practice as a result of the Bar's actions.  She has not indicated that being licensed to practice law in California would have increased her practice in Louisiana.  Thus, there is absolutely nothing on which to predicate any finding of injury in Louisiana to support jurisdiction under this theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

It also stressed Hanson's concern with \"purposeful availment\" of the privileges of the forum.  The Court reiterated that emphasis in Kulko v.

While some of the factors support jurisdiction, on balance the entire case does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unquestionably, it would be inconvenient for the Bar to litigate in Louisiana, but that is an aspect of every suit against a nonresident defendant.  It seems likely, however, that the mere inconvenience to the Bar is less than that to Burstein if she were required to litigate in California.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cause of action here is essentially unrelated to the Bar's contacts with Louisiana;  the only connection is that Burstein's application was mailed from Louisiana and her score received there.  Neither of those occurrences are truly relevant to her cause of action for misgrading, of which all the essential elements must have occurred, if at all, outside of Louisiana.  Because of this, any witnesses likely to be called, other than Burstein herself, are located outside of Louisiana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of the aspects of this case that weighs most heavily against allowing suit in Louisiana is the relative interests of the two potential forum states.  Louisiana's interest in the process of admission of its residents to the bars of other states is minimal at best.  It certainly bears no comparison to the state interest in McGee, which was to give residents who held insurance policies issued by out-of-state companies (potentially a much larger group of residents than applicants for out-of-state bars) protection similar to that which the state provided through its insurance company regulations for customers of in-state companies.  Insurance is, of course, an industry traditionally highly regulated by the state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, while admission to the Louisiana bar is quite rightly an important subject of regulation for Louisiana, admission to the California bar is not.  Problems with admission to the California bar simply do not have the same effect on Louisianans as insurance fraud by out-of-state companies could on Californians.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, California clearly has a vital interest in this suit, because admission to a state's bar is an important subject of state regulation.  Also, it seems more likely (although we reserve decision) that California law will govern the tort and contract claims than that Louisiana law will.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find it difficult to characterize the Bar's relationship to Louisiana as one of \"purposeful[ ] avail[ment] ... of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State ....\"  Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. at 253, 78 S.Ct. at 1239.  The fact that the Bar permits Louisianans to apply for or retain membership does not appear to be equivalent to the commercial activities relied on in International Shoe and McGee.    The benefits conferred on the Bar by so doing are not very great.  The Bar does not go into Louisiana to seek new members;  all its contacts with Louisiana are initiated by Louisianans.  This bears more of a resemblance to the activities in Hanson (Delaware trustee merely received instructions from settlor who had moved to Florida;  Florida had no personal jurisdiction over trustee) and Kulko (father, a New York resident with custody, permitted daughter to live with mother in California;  California had no personal jurisdiction over father) than in those McGee (solicitation of insurance contract;  personal jurisdiction over insurer) or International Shoe (salesmen soliciting orders;  personal jurisdiction over seller).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only aspect of the case strongly supporting personal jurisdiction is that the burden on Burstein of maintaining suit in California is presumably greater than that on the Bar of defending in Louisiana, because she is an individual and may not be as financially able to bear the costs of litigating in a distant forum.  In the first place, however, this is speculation;  in the second, it is outweighed by all the other considerations pointing away from a Louisiana forum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Burstein wishes us to consider an additional factor:  she claims that the Bar so permeates the courts in California that she cannot get a fair trial of her claims in any court there, state or federal.  We decline to accept so generalized and undocumented an accusation of bias, or to give it any weight in our determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Summary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the alleged actions of the Bar complained of in this suit, in and of themselves, have insufficient relation to Louisiana to support the personal jurisdiction of a Louisiana state court.  An analysis of the overall fairness of maintaining the suit in Louisiana, taking into account the nature and substantiality of the Bar's relationship to Louisiana, the burden on the Bar of litigating in Louisiana, the location of the likely witnesses and the source of the state law most likely to be applied, and the interests of Louisiana and the plaintiff in having a Louisiana forum, leads us to the conclusion that allowing this suit to proceed in the district court in Louisiana would offend \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\"    Insurance Corp. of Ireland v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span> (1945)).  It follows that, under the second sentence of rule 4(e), the district court in this case lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant Bar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p>III.

Her specific complaint is that the Bar only answered four out of a set of eight interrogatories, and the district court refused to compel answers to the other four.  The unanswered interrogatories, however, clearly related only to the merits of Burstein's claim;  the answers could have revealed no further facts on which to base personal jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>   It was thus not error for the district court to rule on personal jurisdiction without compelling replies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p>IV. CONCLUSION.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that, since the federal statutes under which the claim in this case is made, sections 1983 and 1343, do not authorize service of process, the second sentence of rule 4(e) requires that we find amenability to personal jurisdiction only \"under the circumstances\" in which a Louisiana court could.  The defendant Bar's relationship with Louisiana is such that the maintenance of this suit in a Louisiana court would offend \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\";  the fourteenth amendment due process clause would thus prevent a Louisiana court from exercising personal jurisdiction over the Bar.  As a federal court in a federal question case, the district court was not constitutionally bound by the fourteenth amendment, but under rule 4(e) it was statutorily bound.  Thus the district court correctly held that it lacked personal jurisdiction.  This result makes it unnecessary to determine whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction in this case would have violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment, which does of course apply to federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not err in denying additional discovery, since the information sought did not relate to the issue of personal jurisdiction.  The court correctly declined to rule on any of Burstein's further contentions once it found it had no personal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that none of Burstein's contentions have merit.  The judgment of the district court dismissing the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction over the Bar is therefore</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Burstein's original complaint also named the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which prepared and graded the multistate examination, as a defendant.

Failure to raise all possible grounds in the first motion waives those not mentioned.

The Supreme Court there decisively rejected sovereignty as the basis for fourteenth amendment due process limitations on personal jurisdiction:</p>\n        <p>The requirement that a court have personal jurisdiction flows not from Art. III, [as does the requirement of subject matter jurisdiction,] but from the Due Process Clause.  The personal jurisdiction requirement recognizes and protects an individual liberty interest.

The husband, who had been awarded custody, permitted his daughter to go live with her mother.  In a subsequent action for increased child support filed in a California state court, the Supreme Court held that there was no personal jurisdiction over the father</p>\n        <p>The California Supreme Court had upheld jurisdiction on alternative grounds, of which one was that the father had caused an \"effect\" within the state.  The United States Supreme Court neither accepted nor rejected the test;  it simply held that the test had not been satisfied.   Id. at 96, 98 S.Ct. at 1699.  It also noted that the \"effect\" in the case was not that intended by the drafters of the Restatement of Conflict of Laws (the source of the test);  the \"effects\" contemplated were apparently tort injury or results of commercial activity.  Id.</p>\n        <p>In the present case, of course, tort injury in Louisiana is precisely what Burstein claims to have alleged.  We hold, however, that there is no adequate allegation of injury in Louisiana.  See text infra.    Further, the Kulko Court noted that, even by its own terms, the \"effects\" test required that the exercise of personal jurisdiction also not be unreasonable.  436 U.S. at 96, 98 S.Ct. at 1699.  We believe such exercise here would be unreasonable.

Further, in Hanson the reference to \"territorial limitations on the power of the respective States,\" 357 U.S. at 251, 78 S.Ct. at 1238, was only one sentence;  it was not crucial to the result, which was reached by an analysis of the factors identified in earlier cases.    World-Wide Volkswagen relied more heavily and more explicitly on the sovereignty reasoning, 444 U.S. at 291-94, 100 S.Ct. at 564-565, but also looked to foreseeability and purposeful availment.
