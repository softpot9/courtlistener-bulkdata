FINN OF\nCOUNSEL), FOR RESPONDENT.\n\n\n     Appeal from a judgment of the Allegany County Court (Thomas P.\nBrown, J.), rendered May 17, 2012. The judgment convicted defendant,\nupon a jury verdict, of vehicular manslaughter in the second degree\nand criminally negligent homicide.\n\n     It is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from is\nunanimously affirmed.\n\n     Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting her,\nupon a jury verdict, of vehicular manslaughter in the second degree\n(Penal Law \u00a7 125.12 [1]) and criminally negligent homicide (\u00a7 125.10).\nContrary to the contention of defendant, we conclude that the evidence\nis legally sufficient to support the conviction. With respect to the\nvehicular manslaughter conviction, defendant contends that the People\nfailed to establish that she ingested a drug set forth in Public\nHealth Law \u00a7 3306 or that her ability to operate the motor vehicle was\nimpaired by such drug (see Penal Law \u00a7 125.12 [1]; Vehicle and Traffic\nLaw \u00a7\u00a7 114-a, 1192 [4], [4-a]). We reject that contention. Defendant\nadmitted to the arresting officer that, prior to the accident, she\ningested oxycodone and alprazolam, both of which are listed in Public\nHealth Law \u00a7 3306 (Schedule II [b] [1] [14]; Schedule IV [c] [1]).\nSeveral witnesses, including law enforcement officers and a registered\nnurse who examined defendant at the hospital, testified that defendant\nexhibited classic signs of drug impairment, including glassy,\nbloodshot eyes; dilated pupils; slurred speech; and poor motor\ncoordination and balance (see People v Gonzalez, 90 AD3d 1668, 1668-\n1669; People v Curkendall, 12 AD3d 710, 713, lv denied 4 NY3d 743;\nPeople v Kraft, 278 AD2d 591, 591, lv denied 96 NY2d 864). Defendant\nalso failed four out of the six standard field sobriety tests\nadministered at the hospital. Further, a certified drug recognition\nexpert concluded based upon his evaluation of defendant that she was\nunder the influence of a central nervous system depressant and a\nnarcotic analgesic, and that she \u201cwas impaired and unable to operate a\n\f                                 -2-                           27\n                                                        KA 12-01343\n\nmotor vehicle safely down the road\u201d (see People v Clark, 309 AD2d\n1076, 1077; People v Crandall, 255 AD2d 617, 618-619). With respect\nto causation, once \u201cit is established that the defendant was\nunlawfully . . . impaired while operating the vehicle, \u2018there [is] a\nrebuttable presumption that, as a result of such [impairment] . . . ,\n[the defendant] operated the motor vehicle . . . in a manner that\ncaused such death\u2019 \u201d (People v Stickler, 97 AD3d 854, 855, lv denied\n20 NY3d 989, quoting Penal Law \u00a7 125.12 [emphasis added]; see People v\nMojica, 62 AD3d 100, 108-109, lv denied 12 NY3d 856). Here, although\ndefendant claimed that the accident occurred because she was\ndistracted by the presence of an \u201cunusually large number of\nwaterfowl,\u201d and not because she was impaired, we conclude that the\nabove evidence, coupled with the circumstances of the accident,\nprovided the jury with a rational basis to reject that explanation\n(see Curkendall, 12 AD3d at 713). We thus conclude that the evidence\nis legally sufficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt of vehicular\nmanslaughter in the second degree beyond a reasonable doubt (see\nPeople v Bain, 85 AD3d 1193, 1194, lv denied 17 NY3d 902; see\ngenerally People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495).\n\n     With respect to the conviction of criminally negligent homicide,\nPenal Law \u00a7 125.10 provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of criminally\nnegligent homicide when, with criminal negligence, he [or she] causes\nthe death of another person.\u201d Criminal negligence \u201crequires a\ndefendant to have \u2018engaged in some blameworthy conduct creating or\ncontributing to a substantial and unjustifiable risk of\u2019 a proscribed\nresult,\u201d such as death (People v Conway, 6 NY3d 869, 872, quoting\nPeople v Boutin, 75 NY2d 692, 696; see \u00a7 15.05 [4]). Here, we\nconclude that the evidence that defendant took an oxycodone tablet\nthat was not prescribed to her, in combination with other prescription\nmedications that had been prescribed to her, and then operated a motor\nvehicle \u201cdemonstrated that [she] engaged in conduct exhibiting \u2018the\nkind of seriously blameworthy carelessness whose seriousness would be\napparent to anyone who shares the community\u2019s general sense of right\nand wrong\u2019 \u201d (People v Asaro, 21 NY3d 677, 685, quoting People v\nCabrera, 10 NY3d 370, 377; see Conway, 6 NY3d at 871-872; Kraft, 278\nAD2d at 592).\n\n     Defendant\u2019s contention that the verdict is against the weight of\nthe evidence \u201cis raised for the first time in [her] reply brief and\ntherefore is not properly before us\u201d (People v Sponburgh, 61 AD3d\n1415, 1416, lv denied 12 NY3d 929). Contrary to the further\ncontention of defendant, we conclude that County Court did not err in\nrefusing to suppress her statements to the police. Defendant was not\nin police custody when the police initially questioned her at the\nhospital and, in any event, we conclude that the questions were\ninvestigatory rather than accusatory in nature (see People v Prue, 8\nAD3d 894, 897, lv denied 3 NY3d 680; People v O\u2019Hanlon, 5 AD3d 1012,\n1012, lv denied 3 NY3d 645; People v Bongiorno, 243 AD2d 719, 720, lv\ndenied 91 NY2d 889; People v Bowen, 229 AD2d 954, 955, lv denied 88\nNY2d 1019). We further conclude that \u201cthe record of the suppression\nhearing establishes that [defendant] was not [impaired by drugs] to\nsuch a degree that [s]he was incapable of voluntarily, knowingly, and\n\f                                 -3-                            27\n                                                         KA 12-01343\n\nintelligently waiving [her] Miranda rights\u201d (People v Cimino, 49 AD3d\n1155, 1157, lv denied 10 NY3d 861 [internal quotation marks omitted];\nsee People v Downey, 254 AD2d 795, lv denied 92 NY2d 1031). Contrary\nto defendant\u2019s contention, the People met their burden of proof at the\nsuppression hearing through the testimony of the two investigating\nofficers who elicited the challenged statements, and the People were\nnot required to produce a third officer who had minimal contact with\ndefendant upon her initial arrival at the hospital (see People v\nWitherspoon, 66 NY2d 973, 974; People v Caballero, 23 AD3d 1031, 1032,\nlv denied 6 NY3d 846; People v Holloway, 16 AD3d 1062, 1063, lv denied\n5 NY3d 763).\n\n     Although we agree with defendant that the court improperly\nadmitted in evidence a photograph of the victim taken when she was\nalive because such evidence was not relevant to any material fact to\nbe proven at trial (see People v Stevens, 76 NY2d 833, 835-836; People\nv Colon, 102 AD3d 705, 705, lv denied 21 NY3d 942; People v Dove, 233\nAD2d 751, 754, lv denied 89 NY2d 1011), we conclude that the error is\nharmless inasmuch as there was \u201coverwhelming evidence of the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt, and no significant probability that the error\ncontributed to [her] conviction[]\u201d (Colon, 102 AD3d at 705; see People\nv Jackson, 41 AD3d 1268, 1269; see generally People v Crimmins, 36\nNY2d 230, 241-242).\n\n     Contrary to the contention of defendant, we conclude that the\nsentence is not unduly harsh and severe. Finally, we have reviewed\ndefendant\u2019s remaining contentions and conclude that they are without\nmerit.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   March 21, 2014                       Frances E.

Contrary\nto defendant\u2019s contention, the People met their burden of proof at the\nsuppression hearing through the testimony of the two investigating\nofficers who elicited the challenged statements, and the People were\nnot required to produce a third officer who had minimal contact with\ndefendant upon her initial arrival at the hospital (see People v\nWitherspoon, 66 NY2d 973, 974; People v Caballero, 23 AD3d 1031, 1032,\nlv denied 6 NY3d 846; People v Holloway, 16 AD3d 1062, 1063, lv denied\n5 NY3d 763).\n\n     Although we agree with defendant that the court improperly\nadmitted in evidence a photograph of the victim taken when she was\nalive because such evidence was not relevant to any material fact to\nbe proven at trial (see People v Stevens, 76 NY2d 833, 835-836; People\nv Colon, 102 AD3d 705, 705, lv denied 21 NY3d 942; People v Dove, 233\nAD2d 751, 754, lv denied 89 NY2d 1011), we conclude that the error is\nharmless inasmuch as there was \u201coverwhelming evidence of the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt, and no significant probability that the error\ncontributed to [her] conviction[]\u201d (Colon, 102 AD3d at 705; see People\nv Jackson, 41 AD3d 1268, 1269; see generally People v Crimmins, 36\nNY2d 230, 241-242).\n\n     Contrary to the contention of defendant, we conclude that the\nsentence is not unduly harsh and severe. Finally, we have reviewed\ndefendant\u2019s remaining contentions and conclude that they are without\nmerit.\n\n\n\n\nEntered:   March 21, 2014                       Frances E.
