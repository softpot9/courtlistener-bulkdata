United States\n\n\nat the time, Dr. Christa Williams, the physician who delivered M.B., served as an employee of\n\nAlcona Citizens for Health, Inc. (\u201cAlcona\u201d), a federally funded medical facility. Bazzo does not\n\ndispute that these facts rendered Dr. Williams and Alcona federal employees under the Federally\n\nSupported Health Centers Assistance Act of 1992, bringing her claim within the purview of the\n\nFTCA. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233(g)(1)(A); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). Nor does she contest her failure to\n\nfile an administrative claim within two years as required by \u00a7 2401(b). Rather, she asks us to excuse\n\nthis oversight because counsel exercised reasonable diligence in assessing possible defendants. The\n\ndistrict court disagreed, and so do we.\n\n\n       Because \u00a7 2401(b) provides a limited waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity,\n\ncourts apply equitable tolling \u201csparingly, and not when there has only been a garden variety claim\n\nof excusable neglect.\u201d Chomic v.

United States\n\n\n       The district court viewed Bazzo\u2019s tolling argument as a \u201cgarden variety instance of failure\n\nto discover the identity of a party amounting to excusable neglect, at worst.\u201d Characterizing\n\ncounsel\u2019s efforts as a \u201cbelow-the-radar investigation,\u201d the court found that counsel had plenty of time\n\nto investigate Dr. Williams\u2019s employment status with Alcona, and that no one attempted to mislead\n\nBazzo about either one\u2019s participation in federal programs. Bazzo resists the district court\u2019s\n\ndiligence conclusion, arguing that none of the procedures or medical records linked Dr. Williams\n\nto Alcona, as opposed to the medical facilities where the procedures took place. The record suggests\n\notherwise.\n\n\n       The government presented two documents linking M.B.\u2019s medical care to Alcona in support\n\nof its motion to dismiss: (1) a release of medical records to the Health Center signed by Bazzo; and\n\n(2) a medical record of M.B.\u2019s diagnosis at Alpena General Hospital, which references Alcona. As\n\na threshold matter, Bazzo claims that the government ambushed her with these documents at the\n\nmotion hearing. On the merits, Bazzo denies having had access to these documents during the\n\nlimitations period, speculates that the records release may not have listed Alcona when she signed\n\nit (but does not suggest what other entity would have received the records), and dismisses the\n\nsignificance of the Alpena record. In any event, the district court did not rely on these documents,\n\nand neither do we. Even accepting Bazzo\u2019s factual allegation for purposes of argument, the absence\n\nof records identifying Alcona does not undermine the district court\u2019s core findings: (1) a sufficient\n\nopportunity to investigate Dr. Williams\u2019s employment status, and (2) the absence of efforts to\n\nconceal that information.\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v. United States\n\n\n       Bazzo does not detail what steps counsel took to determine Dr. Williams\u2019s employment\n\nstatus and, thus, does not explain how her affiliation with federally funded Alcona would have\n\neluded a reasonably diligent party. The record reflects that, in October 2008, Bazzo\u2019s counsel found\n\nan entry for Dr. Williams in the physician directory of the Alpena Regional Medical Center.\n\nAccording to Bazzo\u2019s own account, it appears that counsel made no further attempts to identify Dr.\n\nWilliams\u2019s employment status, or the medical center\u2019s corporate status, until he prepared the Notice\n\nof Intent to File Claim in March 2010\u2014more than two years after Bazzo delivered M.B. and hired\n\ncounsel. Further, counsel\u2019s review of the medical center\u2019s website could have alerted him to the\n\ncenter\u2019s \u201c[f]ederally-designated\u201d status. Counsel offers no explanation for these oversights.\n\n\n       Faced with these facts, the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying equitable\n\ntolling. We AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v. United States\n\n\n       JANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n       As a preliminary matter, I think the majority opinion correctly assumes the availability of\n\nequitable tolling, though not for the sake of argument but because our precedent so requires. Until\n\nthe Supreme Court or our Court sitting en banc holds that the exhaustion provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n2401(b) are jurisdictional requirements, I would affirm the district court\u2019s decision that the statute\n\nis not jurisdictional and that equitable tolling may be applied based on our prior decision in Glarner\n\nv. United States Dep\u2019t of Veterans Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675141\"><a href=\"/opinion/675141/william-f-glarner-v-united-states-of-america-department-of-veterans/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 701 (6th Cir. 1994).\n\n\n       Nonetheless, I would reverse the district court\u2019s decision declining to grant equitable tolling\n\nin this case. While I agree that equitable tolling should be applied sparingly, I cannot accept the\n\ncharacterization of the efforts of plaintiff\u2019s counsel as a \u201cbelow-the-radar investigation\u201d or as a\n\n\u201cgarden variety instance of failure to discover the identity of a party amounting to excusable\n\nneglect.\u201d The record shows that plaintiff\u2019s counsel acted diligently and appropriately at all times,\n\nbut their diligence did not unveil any evidence that Dr. Christa Williams was a federal government\n\nemployee.\n\n\n       While a state statute of limitations cannot supplant the two-year statute of limitations\n\napplicable to a case governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), an understanding of\n\nMichigan\u2019s statute helps to illuminate the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions. Michigan\u2019s statute allows\n\na period of ten years to file a medical malpractice suit on behalf of a minor child. M.C.L.\n\n\u00a7 600.5851(7). Upon taking the case in January 2008, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys requested medical\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v. United States\n\n\nrecords from Alpena Regional Medical Center, Women\u2019s Health Care of Alpena, Munson Medical\n\nCenter, and the University of Michigan Medical Center. None of the medical records, especially\n\nthose from Women\u2019s Health Care of Alpena and Alpena Regional Medical Center where Dr. Christa\n\nWilliams practiced, raised any suspicion that Dr. Williams was a federal government employee.\n\nAmanda Bazzo, the child\u2019s mother, was unaware that Dr. Williams was employed by the federal\n\ngovernment. After obtaining necessary expert medical opinions, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys identified\n\nfive proper defendants, including Dr. Williams.

This is such a\n\ncase where equitable tolling is appropriate. As in Santos, Dr. Williams\u2019 \u201cfederal status, if not covert,\n\nwas at least oblique.\u201d Santos, 559 F.3d at 202. And as the Second and Third Circuits have pointed\n\nout, the mystery surrounding the status of federally-employed physicians is the result of the\n\nGovernment\u2019s\n\n\n        failure to disclose that physicians . . . who provide services in private voluntary\n        hospitals and in what appear to be private clinics, are de jure federal employees.\n        Patients receiving such treatment are not aware, because they are never told or put\n        on any notice, that the clinics they attend are government-funded or that doctors\n        treating them are government employees. Such an omission does not rise to the level\n        of fraud. Nevertheless, by not formulating a regulation that would require notice to\n        a patient that the doctor rendering service to him is an employee of the United States,\n        the Department of Health & Human Services has created a potential statute of\n        limitations trap in states [that] may provide a longer period of time than the FTCA\n        to file a complaint. The number of cases in which the United States has sought to\n        take advantage of this trap suggests that it is aware of the consequences of its failure\n        to disclose the material facts of federal employment by doctors who might reasonably\n        be viewed as private practitioners.\n\n\nSantos, 559 F.3d at 202\u201303 (quoting Valdez v.

The United States responds\n\nthat \u00a7 2401(b), as a jurisdictional requirement, does not permit equitable tolling, and alternatively\n\nthat the district court properly denied equitable tolling on the facts presented. We affirm.\n\n\n       The question whether \u00a7 2401(b)\u2019s exhaustion provisions constitute jurisdictional\n\nrequirements divides circuit courts and even prompts inconsistent rulings within this circuit.\n\nCompare Rogers v.

The government asks us to reconsider Glarner in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent\n\ndecision in John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130 (2008), and an emerging trend\n\ndisfavoring application of equitable tolling in the context of \u00a7 2401(b).2             Specifically, the\n\ngovernment notes John R. Sand & Gravel\u2019s discussion of \u201cmore absolute\u201d limitations provisions,\n\nincluding those like the FTCA that \u201climit[] the scope of a governmental waiver of sovereign\n\nimmunity,\u201d as reason to treat \u00a7 2401(b)\u2019s exhaustion requirement as a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d prerequisite\n\nimpervious to equitable exceptions. See 552 U.S. at 133\u201334.\n\n\n        We need not resolve this circuit split today.

United States\n\n\nat the time, Dr. Christa Williams, the physician who delivered M.B., served as an employee of\n\nAlcona Citizens for Health, Inc. (\u201cAlcona\u201d), a federally funded medical facility. Bazzo does not\n\ndispute that these facts rendered Dr. Williams and Alcona federal employees under the Federally\n\nSupported Health Centers Assistance Act of 1992, bringing her claim within the purview of the\n\nFTCA. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 233(g)(1)(A); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). Nor does she contest her failure to\n\nfile an administrative claim within two years as required by \u00a7 2401(b). Rather, she asks us to excuse\n\nthis oversight because counsel exercised reasonable diligence in assessing possible defendants. The\n\ndistrict court disagreed, and so do we.\n\n\n       Because \u00a7 2401(b) provides a limited waiver of the United States\u2019 sovereign immunity,\n\ncourts apply equitable tolling \u201csparingly, and not when there has only been a garden variety claim\n\nof excusable neglect.\u201d Chomic v. United States, 377 F.3d 607, 615 (6th Cir. 2004) (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted). The party seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of proving\n\nentitlement to it. Robertson v. Simpson, 624 F.3d 781, 784 (6th Cir. 2010). That showing generally\n\nencompasses the following considerations: (1) lack of notice of the filing requirement; (2) lack of\n\nconstructive knowledge of the filing requirement; (3) diligence in pursuing one\u2019s rights; (4) absence\n\nof prejudice to the defendant; and (5) the plaintiff\u2019s reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the\n\nparticular legal requirement. Truitt, 148 F.3d at 648 (citing Andrews v. Orr, 851 F.2d 146, 151 (6th\n\nCir. 1988)). State-law considerations do not bear on this analysis. Chomic, 377 F.3d at 615.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v. United States\n\n\n       The district court viewed Bazzo\u2019s tolling argument as a \u201cgarden variety instance of failure\n\nto discover the identity of a party amounting to excusable neglect, at worst.\u201d Characterizing\n\ncounsel\u2019s efforts as a \u201cbelow-the-radar investigation,\u201d the court found that counsel had plenty of time\n\nto investigate Dr. Williams\u2019s employment status with Alcona, and that no one attempted to mislead\n\nBazzo about either one\u2019s participation in federal programs. Bazzo resists the district court\u2019s\n\ndiligence conclusion, arguing that none of the procedures or medical records linked Dr. Williams\n\nto Alcona, as opposed to the medical facilities where the procedures took place. The record suggests\n\notherwise.\n\n\n       The government presented two documents linking M.B.\u2019s medical care to Alcona in support\n\nof its motion to dismiss: (1) a release of medical records to the Health Center signed by Bazzo; and\n\n(2) a medical record of M.B.\u2019s diagnosis at Alpena General Hospital, which references Alcona. As\n\na threshold matter, Bazzo claims that the government ambushed her with these documents at the\n\nmotion hearing. On the merits, Bazzo denies having had access to these documents during the\n\nlimitations period, speculates that the records release may not have listed Alcona when she signed\n\nit (but does not suggest what other entity would have received the records), and dismisses the\n\nsignificance of the Alpena record. In any event, the district court did not rely on these documents,\n\nand neither do we. Even accepting Bazzo\u2019s factual allegation for purposes of argument, the absence\n\nof records identifying Alcona does not undermine the district court\u2019s core findings: (1) a sufficient\n\nopportunity to investigate Dr. Williams\u2019s employment status, and (2) the absence of efforts to\n\nconceal that information.\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v. United States\n\n\n       Bazzo does not detail what steps counsel took to determine Dr. Williams\u2019s employment\n\nstatus and, thus, does not explain how her affiliation with federally funded Alcona would have\n\neluded a reasonably diligent party. The record reflects that, in October 2008, Bazzo\u2019s counsel found\n\nan entry for Dr. Williams in the physician directory of the Alpena Regional Medical Center.\n\nAccording to Bazzo\u2019s own account, it appears that counsel made no further attempts to identify Dr.\n\nWilliams\u2019s employment status, or the medical center\u2019s corporate status, until he prepared the Notice\n\nof Intent to File Claim in March 2010\u2014more than two years after Bazzo delivered M.B. and hired\n\ncounsel. Further, counsel\u2019s review of the medical center\u2019s website could have alerted him to the\n\ncenter\u2019s \u201c[f]ederally-designated\u201d status. Counsel offers no explanation for these oversights.\n\n\n       Faced with these facts, the district court properly exercised its discretion in denying equitable\n\ntolling. We AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v. United States\n\n\n       JANE B. STRANCH, Circuit Judge. I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n       As a preliminary matter, I think the majority opinion correctly assumes the availability of\n\nequitable tolling, though not for the sake of argument but because our precedent so requires. Until\n\nthe Supreme Court or our Court sitting en banc holds that the exhaustion provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n2401(b) are jurisdictional requirements, I would affirm the district court\u2019s decision that the statute\n\nis not jurisdictional and that equitable tolling may be applied based on our prior decision in Glarner\n\nv. United States Dep\u2019t of Veterans Admin., 30 F.3d 697, 701 (6th Cir. 1994).\n\n\n       Nonetheless, I would reverse the district court\u2019s decision declining to grant equitable tolling\n\nin this case. While I agree that equitable tolling should be applied sparingly, I cannot accept the\n\ncharacterization of the efforts of plaintiff\u2019s counsel as a \u201cbelow-the-radar investigation\u201d or as a\n\n\u201cgarden variety instance of failure to discover the identity of a party amounting to excusable\n\nneglect.\u201d The record shows that plaintiff\u2019s counsel acted diligently and appropriately at all times,\n\nbut their diligence did not unveil any evidence that Dr. Christa Williams was a federal government\n\nemployee.\n\n\n       While a state statute of limitations cannot supplant the two-year statute of limitations\n\napplicable to a case governed by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), an understanding of\n\nMichigan\u2019s statute helps to illuminate the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions. Michigan\u2019s statute allows\n\na period of ten years to file a medical malpractice suit on behalf of a minor child. M.C.L.\n\n\u00a7 600.5851(7). Upon taking the case in January 2008, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys requested medical\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v. United States\n\n\nrecords from Alpena Regional Medical Center, Women\u2019s Health Care of Alpena, Munson Medical\n\nCenter, and the University of Michigan Medical Center. None of the medical records, especially\n\nthose from Women\u2019s Health Care of Alpena and Alpena Regional Medical Center where Dr. Christa\n\nWilliams practiced, raised any suspicion that Dr. Williams was a federal government employee.\n\nAmanda Bazzo, the child\u2019s mother, was unaware that Dr. Williams was employed by the federal\n\ngovernment. After obtaining necessary expert medical opinions, the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys identified\n\nfive proper defendants, including Dr. Williams. Counsel conducted due diligence to determine the\n\nstatus of each defendant, and mailed a Notice of Intent to File Claim to each defendant in March\n\n2010, just over two years after the child\u2019s birth. In April 2010, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel received a\n\nletter from an insurance carrier for Dr. Williams and Alpena Regional Medical Center, requesting\n\nthat all future correspondence be sent to the named claims specialist. It was not until July 2010 that\n\nplaintiff\u2019s counsel received a letter from the Department of Health & Human Services stating that\n\nDr. Williams was an employee of Alcona Citizens for Health, a federally supported health facility.\n\n\n       I disagree that counsel\u2019s review of the Alpena Regional Medical Center\u2019s website should\n\nhave drawn attention to that facility\u2019s \u201c[f]ederally-designated\u201d status and that counsel offered no\n\nexplanation for this oversight. The website simply stated that Alpena Regional Medical Center was\n\n\u201c[f]ederally-designated as a rural Regional Referral Center for all of Northeastern Michigan.\u201d It did\n\nnot provide notice to counsel that Dr. Williams was a federal employee covered by the FTCA. See\n\nSantos ex rel. Beato v. United States, 559 F.3d 189, 203 (3d Cir. 2009).\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v.

Unifund CCR\n\nPartners, 604 F.3d 908, 913 (6th Cir. 2010) (citing Santos, 559 F.3d at 192, 201). This is such a\n\ncase where equitable tolling is appropriate. As in Santos, Dr. Williams\u2019 \u201cfederal status, if not covert,\n\nwas at least oblique.\u201d Santos, 559 F.3d at 202. And as the Second and Third Circuits have pointed\n\nout, the mystery surrounding the status of federally-employed physicians is the result of the\n\nGovernment\u2019s\n\n\n        failure to disclose that physicians . . . who provide services in private voluntary\n        hospitals and in what appear to be private clinics, are de jure federal employees.\n        Patients receiving such treatment are not aware, because they are never told or put\n        on any notice, that the clinics they attend are government-funded or that doctors\n        treating them are government employees. Such an omission does not rise to the level\n        of fraud. Nevertheless, by not formulating a regulation that would require notice to\n        a patient that the doctor rendering service to him is an employee of the United States,\n        the Department of Health & Human Services has created a potential statute of\n        limitations trap in states [that] may provide a longer period of time than the FTCA\n        to file a complaint. The number of cases in which the United States has sought to\n        take advantage of this trap suggests that it is aware of the consequences of its failure\n        to disclose the material facts of federal employment by doctors who might reasonably\n        be viewed as private practitioners.\n\n\nSantos, 559 F.3d at 202\u201303 (quoting Valdez v. United States, 518 F.3d 173, 183 (2d Cir. 2008)\n\n(internal citations omitted)). In Santos, the Third Circuit granted equitable tolling because \u201cthe\n\nGovernment is contending for a result likely to prejudice the weakest and most vulnerable members\n\nof our society who surely are compelled to rely on others for the assertion of their rights,\u201d and\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fNo. 11-1914\nBazzo v. United States\n\n\nbecause \u201c[t]here is no escape from the reality that the statute of limitations trap to which the court\n\nreferred in Valdez is a perfect vehicle to ensnare children.\u201d Id. at 204.\n\n\n       Like the Santos court, I do not think that Congress, in the circumstances presented here,\n\nwould want to bar the minor M.B. from an opportunity to prove her claim. See id. I would grant\n\nequitable tolling. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "58f78c87089caa03c2196d8655cf513badfc164f", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/77428/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145838/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/146191/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/179126/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/200653/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/220617/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/402286/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/508535/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/675141/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/742667/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/755600/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/769981/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/787133/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/793920/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1208161/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1388776/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1403287/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2522066/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2012-08-15T14:21:36Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 10, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/806651/amanda-bazzo-v-united-states/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "806651", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "Amanda Bazzo v.
