John Bevalaque was indicted on May 20, 2011, in the Circuit Court of Rankin County,\n\non seven counts of exploitation of a child under Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-33\n\n(Supp. 2011). Bevalaque pleaded guilty to six counts, and the remaining count was nolle\n\nprosequied. On November 30, 2011, the circuit court accepted Bevalaque\u2019s guilty plea and\n\nsentenced him to thirty-five years on each count, with ten years suspended, in the custody of\n\nthe Mississippi Department of Corrections and five years of supervised probation. The\n\fsentences were ordered to run concurrently. And Bevalaque was ordered to pay court costs\n\nof $413 and a fine of $50,000 on each count, but the circuit court suspended the fine in\n\nCounts II through VI. The judgment of conviction was filed on December 12, 2011.\n\n\u00b62.    Bevalaque filed a motion for postconviction relief (PCR) on December 12, 2014,\n\nclaiming (1) his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary, and (2) he received ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. The circuit court dismissed Bevalaque\u2019s PCR motion without a\n\nhearing. Bevalaque timely appeals.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\u00b63.

When reviewing a\n\ndenial of a PCR motion, we will only disturb the circuit court\u2019s factual findings if they are\n\nclearly erroneous. Id.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n       I.     Knowing and Voluntary Plea\n\n\u00b64.    In his first issue, Bevalaque claims his guilty plea was entered into unknowingly and\n\ninvoluntarily. He argues that because of his mental illness and his prescribed medications,\n\nhe was unable to comprehend his rights, the nature of the charges against him, and the\n\nconsequences of his plea.\n\n\u00b65.    However, the circuit court questioned Bevalaque about his mental illness and\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fprescribed medications:\n\n       Q:     Are you under the influence of any drugs or alcohol?\n\n       A:     No, sir.\n\n       Q:     Have you ever been treated for any mental illness or disorder?\n\n       A:     Yes, sir.\n\n       Q:     What was that?\n\n       A:     Manic depression, and also manic depression here while I\u2019ve been\n              incarcerated.\n\n       Q:     What kind of medication are you taking?\n\n       A:     Six hundred milligrams of lithium per day, and thirty milligrams of\n              Prozac.\n\n       Q:     Did you read and sign your petition to enter a guilty plea?\n\n       A:     [Pause]. Yes, sir.\n\n       Q:     . . . Do you understand everything in it?\n\n       A:     Umm, yes, sir.\n\n\u00b66.    Then the circuit court thoroughly questioned Bevalaque about the waiver of certain\n\nrights\u2014including the right to trial by jury, the right to confront witnesses, and the right to\n\nprotection against self-incrimination; the charges against him\u2014including the elements of the\n\ncrime; and the consequences of his guilty plea\u2014including the minimum and maximum\n\nsentences and fines.\n\n\u00b67.    Bevalaque also argues his attorney coerced him into entering the guilty plea.\n\nHowever, during the plea hearing, Bevalaque was questioned about the voluntariness of his\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fplea:\n\n        Q:     Have any threats been made against you or has there been any use of\n               force or intimidation that might have caused you to change your plea\n               from not guilty to guilty?\n\n        A:     No, sir.\n\n        Q:     Have any promises or hope of reward been made to you in return for\n               your changing your plea from not guilty to guilty?\n\n        A:     No, sir.\n\n        Q:     After your discussions with your attorney, are you the one that\n               decided to plead guilty?\n\n        A:     Yes, sir.\n\n        Q:     Are you telling the court that you\u2019re freely and voluntarily admitting\n               your guilt to the crimes you are pleading guilty to?\n\n        A:     Yes, sir.\n\n\u00b68.     Thus, we find the plea transcript shows Bevalaque\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and\n\nvoluntary. See id. at 1216 (\u00b612) (finding \u201c[s]tatements made in open court under oath \u2018carry\n\na strong presumption of veracity\u2019\u201d). While \u201can attack on a facially correct plea may survive\n\nsummary dismissal if supporting affidavits of other persons are attached,\u201d Bevalaque\n\nattached no such evidence to his PCR motion.

Ct. App. 2007). This issue is without merit.\n\n        II.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\u00b69.     In his second issue, Bevalaque claims his counsel was ineffective for (1) failing to\n\nconduct any meaningful investigation, (2) failing to ascertain whether Bevalaque was\n\ncompetent to enter a guilty plea or assist in his own defense, (3) failing to properly advise\n\n\n                                              4\n\fBevalaque of possible defenses, elements of the crime, or consequences of entering a guilty\n\nplea, and (4) coercing Bevalaque into pleading guilty and agreeing to a disproportionate\n\nsentence.\n\n\u00b610.   We have already concluded that Bevalaque entered his guilty plea knowingly and\n\nvoluntarily. \u201cA voluntary guilty plea waives claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,\n\n\u2018except insofar as the alleged ineffectiveness relates to the voluntariness of the giving of the\n\nguilty plea.\u2019\u201d Thomas, 159 So. 3d at 1215 (\u00b610) (quoting Fortenberry v.

When a defendant pleads guilty, and later asserts\n\nineffective assistance of counsel, he \u201cmust demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s \u2018conduct\n\nproximately resulted in the guilty plea, and that but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have\n\nentered the plea.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Fortenberry, 151 So. 3d at 225 (\u00b611)).\n\n\u00b611.   But Bevalaque provides nothing beyond his own assertions. See Ealey v.

Furthermore, Bevalaque\u2019s assertions are contradicted\n\nby his prior sworn testimony about his counsel\u2019s representation.
