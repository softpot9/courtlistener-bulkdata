Matheny, Assistant United States\nAttorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Raleigh, North\nCarolina, for Appellee.\n\fUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n       Chester Edgerton appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his\n\n28    U.S.C.    \u00a7   2255    motion     to   vacate    based   on   his   attorney\u2019s\n\nfailure to file an appeal on his behalf.                   Because Edgerton has\n\nnot shown that a rational defendant in his circumstance would\n\nhave    wanted      to   appeal   or    \u201creasonably      demonstrated\u201d     that   he\n\nexpressed interest in appealing, we must affirm.\n\n\n                                            I.\n\n       On December 1, 2003, Edgerton pled guilty to possession\n\nwith intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base,\n\ncocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1);\n\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924; using, carrying and possessing a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); and, maintaining a place\n\nfor    the     purpose     of   manufacturing,        distributing   or   using   a\n\ncontrolled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a).                         On\n\nMay 4, 2004, Edgerton was sentenced, without a plea agreement,\n\nto a 352-month term of imprisonment.                 He did not appeal.\n\n       Edgerton claims, however, that he requested his attorney,\n\nMark Edwards, to file an appeal.                 When no appeal was filed,\n\nEdgerton filed a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255,\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\falleging that Edwards failed to file a notice of appeal despite\n\nhis request to do so.            An evidentiary hearing was held where\n\nEdgerton was represented by new counsel.\n\n      At the evidentiary hearing, Edgerton testified that while\n\nhe was in the Franklin County Jail following his sentencing, he\n\nphoned Edwards and requested an appeal.                Edgerton testified that\n\nEdwards \u201csaid he would look into it.\u201d                   (J.A. 53.)      Edgerton\n\ncould not recall when this phone call was made - only that he\n\nwas in the Franklin County Jail \u201cfor something over a month.\u201d\n\n(J.A. 52.)     Prior to this phone conversation, Edgerton had not\n\ndiscussed    his     appellate   rights    or    \u201cany    grounds   or   possible\n\nappeal issues.\u201d       (J.A. 53.)\n\n      To the contrary, Edwards testified that he did not recall\n\never talking to Edgerton after he was sentenced, and he had no\n\nrecollection of ever talking to Edgerton about the advisability\n\nof   an   appeal.1      (J.A.    46-47.)        More    specifically,    Edwards\n\ntestified that he did not recall having a telephone conversation\n\nwith Edgerton about his appeal.           (J.A. 55.)\n\n      Edwards also testified that when a client specifically asks\n\nhim to file an appeal, he does so.               He even goes so far as to\n\n\n      1\n      Edwards also noted that his recollection was unclear\nbecause his Edgerton records were maintained on a computer\nsoftware program that was no longer working. (J.A. 47.)\n\n\n                                      4\n\ffile       Anders2      briefs     on     behalf       of    clients.         Further,   Edwards\n\nstated that had there been discussions regarding an appeal, he\n\nwould have advised Edgerton to not seek an appeal because there\n\nwere \u201cno grounds to pursue\u201d and an appeal could \u201ckill any chance\n\nEdgerton might have [had] of coming back on a Rule 35\u201d motion.\n\nAccording          to     Edwards,        Edgerton           expressed        an   interest    in\n\ncooperating with authorities as his sentencing date approached\n\nin the hopes of obtaining a reduced sentence.\n\n       In     addition,        Edwards       vaguely          remembered       Edgerton     being\n\noffered       a    written         plea    agreement,          which     he    did    not   sign.\n\nEdwards testified that the proposed plea likely contained an\n\nappeal waiver provision as that was the policy of the United\n\nStates Attorney Office at the time. (J.A. 44-45.)                                  After hearing\n\nthis conflicting testimony, the district court found Edwards\u2019s\n\ntestimony credible and dismissed Edgerton\u2019s claim.\n\n\n\n                                               II.\n\n       Edgerton argues that the district court erred in dismissing\n\nhis \u00a7 2255 motion.                  He contends that Edwards disregarded his\n\nrequest       to        file   a    notice     of           appeal   and,      therefore,     was\n\nineffective as counsel.                    In response, the government contends\n\n\n       2\n           Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).\n\n\n                                                   5\n\fthat there is no evidence, other than Edgerton\u2019s own speculative\n\nrecollections, that a discussion took place between Edgerton and\n\nEdwards concerning an appeal.\n\n       \u201cWhen       reviewing    an    appeal      from    the   denial    of    a    \u00a7    2255\n\nmotion,       we     review     de     novo        the     district      court\u2019s         legal\n\nconclusions.\u201d          United States v. Poindexter, 492 F.3d 263, 267\n\n(4th Cir. 2007) (citing United States v. Nicholson, 475 F.3d\n\n241,    248    (4th     Cir.    2007)).            The    district    court\u2019s        factual\n\nfindings are reviewed for clear error.                       See Mickens v. Taylor,\n\n240 F.3d 348, 360 (4th Cir. 2001).                       The Supreme Court has long\n\nrecognized that under the Sixth Amendment the right to counsel\n\nincludes \u201cthe right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d                                 U.S.\n\nConst. amend. VI.; see also McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759,\n\n771    n.14    (1970).         In    order    to    establish     a   Sixth     Amendment\n\nviolation based on counsel\u2019s failure to appeal, Edgerton must\n\nprove that (1) counsel was ineffective and (2) but for counsel\u2019s\n\nineffectiveness, an appeal would have been filed.                              See Roe v.\n\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470 (2000).                      While the Constitution does\n\nnot give a criminal defendant the right to appeal as a matter of\n\nright, the United States Code, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, does.                              Thus, an\n\nattorney\u2019s failure to file an appeal after being instructed by\n\nhis client to do so is per se ineffective.                        Flores-Ortega, 492\n\nF.3d at 483.\n\n                                              6\n\f      In Flores-Ortega, the Supreme Court held that \u201ccounsel has\n\na constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant\n\nabout an appeal when there is reason to think either (1) that a\n\nrational defendant would want to appeal (for example, because\n\nthere are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal), or (2) that this\n\nparticular defendant reasonably demonstrated to counsel that he\n\nwas interested in appealing.\u201d                     Id. at 480.          In making this\n\ndetermination, we must \u201ctake into account all the information\n\ncounsel knew or should have known\u201d and consider \u201cwhether the\n\ndefendant received the sentence bargained for as part of the\n\nplea and whether the plea expressly reserved or waived some or\n\nall   appeal   rights.\u201d       Id.         A       presumption    of    prejudice        also\n\napplies, even if a defendant did not instruct his attorney to\n\nfile an appeal, when the defendant can show, had he received\n\nreasonable     advice      from     his       attorney,       that     he    would      have\n\ninstructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal.                                Id.\n\nat 486.      Whether a defendant meets this standard turns on the\n\nspecific facts of each case.              Id.\n\n      As    noted   above,    Edgerton            maintains     that    he     telephoned\n\nEdwards     after   his    sentencing         and    requested       that    he    file   an\n\nappeal.     The district court found, based on Edwards\u2019s testimony,\n\nthat Edgerton did not unequivocally instruct Edwards to file a\n\ntimely     notice   of    appeal.         Given      Edgerton\u2019s       sparse      and   non-\n\n                                              7\n\fspecific recollections, the district court\u2019s credibility finding\n\nis not clearly erroneous.\n\n       Notwithstanding         this,    Edgerton          contends      that    Edwards,\n\nnevertheless, was ineffective because he failed to consult with\n\nhim regarding an appeal.             See United States v. Witherspoon, 231\n\nF.3d 923 (4th Cir. 2000).              He points out that not only does he\n\nnot recall Edwards advising him of his appeal rights but that\n\nEdwards        similarly      testified          to   not     recalling        having   a\n\nconversation with him.              Further, Edgerton argues that he had a\n\nrational       basis   for    filing    an       appeal     and   was   prejudiced      by\n\nEdwards\u2019s failure to do so; that is, (1) he allegedly rejected a\n\nplea       agreement   with   the    Government       to    preserve     his    right   to\n\nappeal, and (2) had an appeal been filed, his sentence could\n\nhave been reviewed in light of Blakley v. Washington3 and United\n\nStates v. Booker.4             Thus, the salient issue is \u201cwhether the\n\nfailure       to   consult    itself   constitutes          deficient    performance.\u201d\n\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 478.\n\n       The Supreme Court has rejected a bright-line rule requiring\n\ncounsel to always consult with a defendant regarding an appeal.\n\nFlores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 480.                   Proffering an example similar\n\n\n\n       3\n           542 U.S. 296 (2004).\n       4\n           543 U.S. 220 (2005).\n\n\n                                             8\n\fto   Edgerton\u2019s   case,     the    Supreme      Court      reasoned       that    when     a\n\ndefendant does not express an interest in appealing and counsel\n\nconcludes that there are no nonfrivolous grounds for an appeal\n\n\u201cit would be difficult to say that counsel is \u2018professionally\n\nunreasonable\u2019 as a constitutional matter, in not consulting with\n\na defendant regarding an appeal.\u201d              Id.\n\n       Indeed, it is difficult in this case to say that Edwards\u2019s\n\nfailure     to    consult         with        Edgerton         was       professionally\n\nunreasonable.         Under the Flores-Ortega standard, Edgerton has\n\nnot shown that a rational defendant in his circumstance would\n\nhave   wanted    to    appeal     or   \u201creasonably         demonstrated\u201d         that    he\n\nexpressed an interest in appealing.                  While Edgerton argues that\n\nhe specifically turned down a plea agreement to appeal, he only\n\nprovides conjecture as evidence that such was his reasoning at\n\nthe time.\n\n       At the evidentiary hearing, Edgerton did not testify that\n\nhe rejected the plea agreement to preserve his appellate rights.\n\nCoupled   with    Edwards\u2019s       uncertainty        as    to     whether      the    plea\n\nagreement   actually       contained      an    appeal         waiver    -    Edgerton\u2019s\n\nargument,   it    \u201cmost     likely     contained          an    appeal       waiver,\u201d    is\n\nunpersuasive.         A   defendant      who    specifically         rejects      a     plea\n\nagreement for the purpose of protecting his appellate rights\n\nwould know whether the agreement actually contained a waiver.\n\n                                          9\n\f       Further,     Edgerton    fails     to    even   articulate       a   ground     he\n\nwould have raised on appeal.                   Although a defendant need not\n\nprove     his     \u201chypothetical     appeal       might     have   had       merit,\u201d    a\n\nhypothetical ground for appeal is highly relevant to determining\n\nwhether Edgerton has been prejudiced or even expressed a desire\n\nto appeal.        Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 485-486.               Edgerton does,\n\nhowever, posit that had an appeal been filed he may have reaped\n\nthe benefits of Blakely and Booker.                While this maybe true, we\n\nare confined to the information known or should have been known\n\nto Edwards at the time.\n\n        At the time of Edgerton\u2019s sentencing, Blakely was before\n\nthe Supreme Court but not yet decided and certiorari had not yet\n\nbeen granted in Booker.           Thus, it is purely speculative that he\n\nwould have \u201creaped the benefits\u201d of these decisions.                         Under the\n\nmandatory guidelines regime Edgerton was facing a significant\n\nterm    of    imprisonment.       After    he    received    a    sentence     at     the\n\nbottom       of   his   guideline   range,       Edwards    testified        that     the\n\ndefense strategy was to cooperate with the government in the\n\nhopes of receiving a sentence reduction under Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 35(b).           This was a reasonable strategy given\n\nEdwards\u2019s assessment that there were no other reasonable grounds\n\nto pursue and Edgerton had expressed an interest in cooperating\n\nwith the government.           Edwards also testified that had Edgerton\n\n                                          10\n\fexpressed interest in appealing he would have advised him that\n\nan appeal could have jeopardized his chance of receiving a Rule\n\n35 sentence reduction.\n\n       We have held that an attorney must file a notice of appeal\n\nwhen unequivocally instructed to do so by his client, even if\n\ndoing so would be contrary to a plea agreement and harmful to\n\nthe client\u2019s interest.            United States v. Poindexter, 492 F.3d\n\n263, 273 (4th Cir. 2007).              Despite Edwards\u2019s concerns, he would\n\nhave    still     been   required      to   file     a    notice      of    appeal    -   had\n\nEdgerton unequivocally instructed him to do so.                               Because the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s finding that Edgerton did not do so withstands\n\nclear    error       review,     we     cannot       hold       that       Edwards     acted\n\n\u201cprofessionally unreasonable,\u201d as a constitutional matter.                                 And\n\nwhile   it   is      disconcerting     that      Edwards     did     not     consult      with\n\nEdgerton regarding his appellate rights, there is no evidence\n\ndemonstrating        Edgerton    was    prejudiced         by   the    failure       or    had\n\nanything to gain from appealing.                     The Supreme Court and this\n\nCourt    recognizes      that    \u201cthe       better       practice      is    for     counsel\n\nroutinely       to     consult    with        the        defendant         regarding      the\n\npossibility of an appeal.\u201d             Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 479.                     But\n\nit is not the standard and, thus, Edgerton\u2019s claim fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f                            III.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is\n\n                                                   AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                          12\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                             UNPUBLISHED\n\n                    UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                        FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                             No. 06-6395\n\n\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                Plaintiff - Appellee,\n\n           v.\n\n\nCHESTER EDGERTON,\n\n                Defendant - Appellant.\n\n\n\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of North Carolina, at Raleigh.

Matheny, Assistant United States\nAttorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Raleigh, North\nCarolina, for Appellee.\n\fUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\n\n\n\n                                2\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n       Chester Edgerton appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his\n\n28    U.S.C.    \u00a7   2255    motion     to   vacate    based   on   his   attorney\u2019s\n\nfailure to file an appeal on his behalf.                   Because Edgerton has\n\nnot shown that a rational defendant in his circumstance would\n\nhave    wanted      to   appeal   or    \u201creasonably      demonstrated\u201d     that   he\n\nexpressed interest in appealing, we must affirm.\n\n\n                                            I.\n\n       On December 1, 2003, Edgerton pled guilty to possession\n\nwith intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base,\n\ncocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1);\n\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924; using, carrying and possessing a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A); and, maintaining a place\n\nfor    the     purpose     of   manufacturing,        distributing   or   using   a\n\ncontrolled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a).                         On\n\nMay 4, 2004, Edgerton was sentenced, without a plea agreement,\n\nto a 352-month term of imprisonment.                 He did not appeal.\n\n       Edgerton claims, however, that he requested his attorney,\n\nMark Edwards, to file an appeal.                 When no appeal was filed,\n\nEdgerton filed a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255,\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\falleging that Edwards failed to file a notice of appeal despite\n\nhis request to do so.            An evidentiary hearing was held where\n\nEdgerton was represented by new counsel.\n\n      At the evidentiary hearing, Edgerton testified that while\n\nhe was in the Franklin County Jail following his sentencing, he\n\nphoned Edwards and requested an appeal.                Edgerton testified that\n\nEdwards \u201csaid he would look into it.\u201d                   (J.A. 53.)      Edgerton\n\ncould not recall when this phone call was made - only that he\n\nwas in the Franklin County Jail \u201cfor something over a month.\u201d\n\n(J.A. 52.)     Prior to this phone conversation, Edgerton had not\n\ndiscussed    his     appellate   rights    or    \u201cany    grounds   or   possible\n\nappeal issues.\u201d       (J.A. 53.)\n\n      To the contrary, Edwards testified that he did not recall\n\never talking to Edgerton after he was sentenced, and he had no\n\nrecollection of ever talking to Edgerton about the advisability\n\nof   an   appeal.1      (J.A.    46-47.)        More    specifically,    Edwards\n\ntestified that he did not recall having a telephone conversation\n\nwith Edgerton about his appeal.           (J.A. 55.)\n\n      Edwards also testified that when a client specifically asks\n\nhim to file an appeal, he does so.               He even goes so far as to\n\n\n      1\n      Edwards also noted that his recollection was unclear\nbecause his Edgerton records were maintained on a computer\nsoftware program that was no longer working. (J.A. 47.)\n\n\n                                      4\n\ffile       Anders2      briefs     on     behalf       of    clients.         Further,   Edwards\n\nstated that had there been discussions regarding an appeal, he\n\nwould have advised Edgerton to not seek an appeal because there\n\nwere \u201cno grounds to pursue\u201d and an appeal could \u201ckill any chance\n\nEdgerton might have [had] of coming back on a Rule 35\u201d motion.\n\nAccording          to     Edwards,        Edgerton           expressed        an   interest    in\n\ncooperating with authorities as his sentencing date approached\n\nin the hopes of obtaining a reduced sentence.\n\n       In     addition,        Edwards       vaguely          remembered       Edgerton     being\n\noffered       a    written         plea    agreement,          which     he    did    not   sign.\n\nEdwards testified that the proposed plea likely contained an\n\nappeal waiver provision as that was the policy of the United\n\nStates Attorney Office at the time. (J.A. 44-45.)                                  After hearing\n\nthis conflicting testimony, the district court found Edwards\u2019s\n\ntestimony credible and dismissed Edgerton\u2019s claim.\n\n\n\n                                               II.\n\n       Edgerton argues that the district court erred in dismissing\n\nhis \u00a7 2255 motion.                  He contends that Edwards disregarded his\n\nrequest       to        file   a    notice     of           appeal   and,      therefore,     was\n\nineffective as counsel.

Thus, an\n\nattorney\u2019s failure to file an appeal after being instructed by\n\nhis client to do so is per se ineffective.

A       presumption    of    prejudice        also\n\napplies, even if a defendant did not instruct his attorney to\n\nfile an appeal, when the defendant can show, had he received\n\nreasonable     advice      from     his       attorney,       that     he    would      have\n\ninstructed his attorney to file a timely notice of appeal.

Further, Edgerton argues that he had a\n\nrational       basis   for    filing    an       appeal     and   was   prejudiced      by\n\nEdwards\u2019s failure to do so; that is, (1) he allegedly rejected a\n\nplea       agreement   with   the    Government       to    preserve     his    right   to\n\nappeal, and (2) had an appeal been filed, his sentence could\n\nhave been reviewed in light of Blakley v.

Under the Flores-Ortega standard, Edgerton has\n\nnot shown that a rational defendant in his circumstance would\n\nhave   wanted    to    appeal     or   \u201creasonably         demonstrated\u201d         that    he\n\nexpressed an interest in appealing.                  While Edgerton argues that\n\nhe specifically turned down a plea agreement to appeal, he only\n\nprovides conjecture as evidence that such was his reasoning at\n\nthe time.\n\n       At the evidentiary hearing, Edgerton did not testify that\n\nhe rejected the plea agreement to preserve his appellate rights.\n\nCoupled   with    Edwards\u2019s       uncertainty        as    to     whether      the    plea\n\nagreement   actually       contained      an    appeal         waiver    -    Edgerton\u2019s\n\nargument,   it    \u201cmost     likely     contained          an    appeal       waiver,\u201d    is\n\nunpersuasive.         A   defendant      who    specifically         rejects      a     plea\n\nagreement for the purpose of protecting his appellate rights\n\nwould know whether the agreement actually contained a waiver.\n\n                                          9\n\f       Further,     Edgerton    fails     to    even   articulate       a   ground     he\n\nwould have raised on appeal.                   Although a defendant need not\n\nprove     his     \u201chypothetical     appeal       might     have   had       merit,\u201d    a\n\nhypothetical ground for appeal is highly relevant to determining\n\nwhether Edgerton has been prejudiced or even expressed a desire\n\nto appeal.        Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 485-486.               Edgerton does,\n\nhowever, posit that had an appeal been filed he may have reaped\n\nthe benefits of Blakely and Booker.                While this maybe true, we\n\nare confined to the information known or should have been known\n\nto Edwards at the time.\n\n        At the time of Edgerton\u2019s sentencing, Blakely was before\n\nthe Supreme Court but not yet decided and certiorari had not yet\n\nbeen granted in Booker.           Thus, it is purely speculative that he\n\nwould have \u201creaped the benefits\u201d of these decisions.                         Under the\n\nmandatory guidelines regime Edgerton was facing a significant\n\nterm    of    imprisonment.       After    he    received    a    sentence     at     the\n\nbottom       of   his   guideline   range,       Edwards    testified        that     the\n\ndefense strategy was to cooperate with the government in the\n\nhopes of receiving a sentence reduction under Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 35(b).           This was a reasonable strategy given\n\nEdwards\u2019s assessment that there were no other reasonable grounds\n\nto pursue and Edgerton had expressed an interest in cooperating\n\nwith the government.           Edwards also testified that had Edgerton\n\n                                          10\n\fexpressed interest in appealing he would have advised him that\n\nan appeal could have jeopardized his chance of receiving a Rule\n\n35 sentence reduction.\n\n       We have held that an attorney must file a notice of appeal\n\nwhen unequivocally instructed to do so by his client, even if\n\ndoing so would be contrary to a plea agreement and harmful to\n\nthe client\u2019s interest.            United States v. Poindexter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1446960\"><a href=\"/opinion/1446960/united-states-v-poindexter/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273 (4th Cir. 2007).              Despite Edwards\u2019s concerns, he would\n\nhave    still     been   required      to   file     a    notice      of    appeal    -   had\n\nEdgerton unequivocally instructed him to do so.                               Because the\n\ndistrict court\u2019s finding that Edgerton did not do so withstands\n\nclear    error       review,     we     cannot       hold       that       Edwards     acted\n\n\u201cprofessionally unreasonable,\u201d as a constitutional matter.                                 And\n\nwhile   it   is      disconcerting     that      Edwards     did     not     consult      with\n\nEdgerton regarding his appellate rights, there is no evidence\n\ndemonstrating        Edgerton    was    prejudiced         by   the    failure       or    had\n\nanything to gain from appealing.                     The Supreme Court and this\n\nCourt    recognizes      that    \u201cthe       better       practice      is    for     counsel\n\nroutinely       to     consult    with        the        defendant         regarding      the\n\npossibility of an appeal.\u201d             Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 479.                     But\n\nit is not the standard and, thus, Edgerton\u2019s claim fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f                            III.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is\n\n                                                   AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                          12\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
