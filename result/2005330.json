Adams, Assistant United States Trustee, and Martin Ochs, chapter 7 trustee in the above-captioned case (the \"Chapter 7 Trustee\"), appeared and were heard, and the Debtor appeared and gave testimony. We The People, Mr. Distenfield, and We The People USA (collectively, the \"Respondents\"), did not file opposition to the Application or appear at the Hearing.</p>\n<p>At the completion of the May 13 Hearing, after testimony and argument, the Court granted the Application of the United States Trustee and directed that an order be submitted. <i>See</i> May 13, 2004 Docket Entry.

Application, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15. At the 341 Meeting, the April 12 Examination, and again at the May 13 Hearing, the Debtor testified that the signatures on the second page of the Petition, the Declaration Concerning Debtor's Schedules, the Declaration Under Penalty of Perjury by Individual Debtor of the Statement of Financial Affairs, and the Chapter 7 Individual Debtor's Statement of Intention, were not her signatures (collectively, \"the Non-Debtor Signature Pages\"). Application, \u00b6 16; Exhibit C, pp. 5-8; Exhibit D, pp. 4-6; Exhibit E; May 13 Hearing Record.</p>\n<p>The Debtor further testified at the April 12 Examination that the signatures on the Statement of Assistance of Non-Attorney with Respect to the Filing of this Petition, Notice to Individual Consumer Debtor, Statement Pursuant to Local Bankruptcy Rule 1073-2(b), Notice to Pro Se Debtor, and the Verification of Creditor Matrix (collectively, the \"Debtor Signature Pages\"), were her signatures.

The Chapter 7 Trustee further stated that, based on the omissions which could have put the Debtor's discharge at risk, the services rendered to the Debtor by Mr. Distenfield, We The People, and We The People USA, had negative value to the Debtor. May 13 Hearing Record.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Discussion</i></h2>\n<p>Congress enacted Section 110 to the Bankruptcy Code in 1994 \"to remedy what was perceived to be widespread fraud and unauthorized practice of law by nonattorneys who prepared bankruptcy documents for consumer debtors.\" 2 C OLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY, \u00b6 110.01 (15th ed. rev.2004) (citing <i>Ferm v. United States Trustee (In re Crawford),</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766535\"><a href=\"/opinion/766535/in-re-laorphus-crawford-debtor-jack-ferm-v-united-states-trustee-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></span> (2000)). Section 110 requires bankruptcy petition preparers to take certain actions, and prohibits certain conduct on their part. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a)-(k). To ensure compliance with its requirements, Section 110 contains detailed remedial provisions, including fines, actual and statutory damages, and injunctive relief. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><i>The Scope of Section 110(a)(1)</i></p>\n<p>Section 110(a)(1) defines a bankruptcy petition preparer as a \"person, other than an attorney or an employee of an attorney, who prepares for compensation a document for filing\" in a bankruptcy case. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a). The Bankruptcy Code <span class=\"star-pagination\">*115</span> defines \"person\" as an \"individual, partnership, and corporation. . . .\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(41). Here, the uncontroverted evidence shows that Mr. Distenfield and We The People are bankruptcy petition preparers within the meaning of Section 110, because they prepared, for compensation, a document for filing in a bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p>As indicated above, the record reflects that the Debtor and We The People entered into a Bankruptcy Document Preparation Agreement, pursuant to which the Debtor retained the services of We The People to \"type bankruptcy forms\" for her. The names \"Derek Distenfield-We The People\" are inserted in seven places in the Debtor's bankruptcy petition where the form calls for the identification of the bankruptcy petition preparer. The record also shows a copy of the money order for $199.00 paid by the Debtor to We The People, and the Disclosure of Compensation of Bankruptcy Petition Preparer reflects that \"Derek Distenfield-We The People\" accepted $199.00 from the Debtor for \"Typing Petition.\"</p>\n<p>Finally, the certifications contained in the Petition, the Declaration Concerning Debtor's Schedules, the Statement of Financial Affairs, the Chapter 7 Individual Debtor's State of Intention, the Declaration of Bankruptcy Petition Preparer, and the Certification and Signature of Non-Attorney Bankruptcy Petition Preparer, all reflect Mr. Distenfield's signature to the certification that he is \"a bankruptcy petition preparer as defined in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110,\" and that he \"prepared this document for compensation. . . .\"</p>\n<p>The Court finds that Mr. Distenfield and We The People functioned as bankruptcy petition preparers within the meaning of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a) in this bankruptcy case, and accordingly, that they are required to comply with the provisions of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(a)-(k).</p>\n<p><i>The Alleged Violations of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(e)(1)</i></p>\n<p>Section 110(e) provides \"(1) A bankruptcy petition preparer shall not execute any document on behalf of a debtor. (2) A bankruptcy petition preparer may be fined not more than $500 for each document executed in violation of paragraph (1).\" Thus, the elements of a violation of Section 110(e) are that an entity or individual is a bankruptcy petition preparer, and that the entity or individual executed a document on behalf of the debtor.</p>\n<p>It is entirely appropriate that penalties should attach to a violation of this section, because of the importance of the debtor's signature on his or her bankruptcy filings. As one commentator has observed, \"Section 110(e) ensures that the debtor is responsible for the accuracy of the filing. The debtor's signature on a document . . . is made under oath and penalty of perjury attaches.\" 2 COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY, \u00b6 110.05 (15th ed. rev.2004). Indeed, as one court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote>Because of the importance of the accuracy of a debtor's petition and schedules . . . Congress rejected the Senate version of the bill that would have given a petition preparer authority to execute a document for the debtor. `In light of the evidence that petition preparers frequently forged debtors' names on bankruptcy petitions, Congress was not convinced that there would ever be a circumstance that would justify a preparer signing a petition on behalf of a debtor.'</blockquote>\n<p><i>Marshall v.

Application, \u00b6 16; Exhibit C, pp. 5-8; Exhibit D, pp. 4-6; Exhibit E; May 13 Hearing Record. The Debtor also testified at the April 12 Examination, and affirmed that testimony at the May 13 Hearing, that when she returned to We The People to ask who had signed her name to the Non-Debtor Signature Pages, she was advised that Mr. Distenfield signed her name.

The Court finds that a fine of $500.00 for each violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(e)(1) should be imposed upon Mr. Distenfield and We The People, jointly and severally, for a total fine of $2,000.00, for these violations of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(e)(1).</p>\n<p><i>The Alleged Violation of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(g)(1)</i></p>\n<p>Section 110(g) provides \"(1) A bankruptcy petition preparer shall not collect or receive any payment from the debtor or on behalf of the debtor for the court fees in connection with filing the petition. (2) A bankruptcy petition preparer shall be fined not more than $500 for each violation of paragraph 1.\" 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110(g). The elements of a violation of Section 110(g), therefore, are that an entity or individual is a bankruptcy petition preparer, and that the entity or individual collected or received a court fee, including a filing fee, in connection with filing a debtor's bankruptcy petition.</p>\n<p>As several courts have observed, \"Section 110(g) was enacted for three reasons: (1) to prevent the unauthorized filing of petitions; (2) to prevent or curtail the preparer's influence on a debtor's decision and timing on petition filing; and (3) to prevent a preparer's misrepresentation, or misquoting of the filing fee.\" <i>Tighe v.
