The district court denied relief. We affirm.\n       When Grant filed his petition for writ of mandamus, he was the constable of Precinct 4,\nNavarro County. He officially had taken office as Constable on January 1, 2009.\n       Navarro County\u2019s fiscal year begins on October 1 each year and ends on September 30 of\nthe following year. The commissioners court of Navarro County approved the budget for fiscal\n\fyear 2008\u20132009 by order dated September 22, 2008. That budget period began on October 1,\n2008, and ended on September 30, 2009. The commissioners court approved the budget for\nfiscal year 2009\u20132010 by order dated September 21, 2009.            That budget period began on\nOctober 1, 2009, and ended on September 30, 2010. On September 14, 2009, not satisfied with\nthe salary that the commissioners court set for his office for fiscal year 2009\u20132010, Grant filed a\nrequest to be heard by the Navarro County salary grievance committee. That hearing never took\nplace.   Next, on January 22, 2010, Grant filed his original petition for writ of mandamus. He\nfiled an amended petition for writ of mandamus on August 13, 2010.\n         In his amended petition, Grant asked the trial court to order the commissioners court to\nset a reasonable salary for his office for \u201cthe fiscal years 2009 and 2010.\u201d It is apparent from\nGrant\u2019s pleadings that, when he refers to fiscal year 2009, he is referring to that period of time\nbeginning October 1, 2008, and ending on September 30, 2009. When he refers to fiscal year\n2010, he is referring to that period of time beginning October 1, 2009, and ending on\nSeptember 30, 2010.\n         On July 19, 2010, the commissioners court filed a \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment and\nPlea to the Jurisdiction.\u201d On August 27, 2010, the district court granted the motion and ordered\nthat Grant \u201ctake nothing by his claims.\u201d The district court did not state the reasons why it\nentered its order. This appeal followed.\n         Grant presents us with one issue: \u201cWhether the district court has mandamus power and\njurisdiction over the county commissioners court to force it to set a reasonable salary for the\nconstable\u2019s office.\u201d The answer to that question is generally yes. The commissioners court\nagrees with that general proposition, but argues that the district court\u2019s power and jurisdiction are\nnot without limitation.\n         The principal governing body of a county is the commissioners court.

It urges that one such limitation is found in Section 152.0165(a)\nof the Local Government Code.         \u201cAn elected county or precinct officer may not file suit\nregarding the officer\u2019s salary or personal expenses unless a hearing has been requested and held\nunder Section 152.016.\u201d        TEX.

Id. \u00a7 152.016.\nThe commissioners court takes the position that a Section 152.016 hearing was never held for\neither fiscal year and that, because there was not, the district court was deprived of jurisdiction in\nthis case.\n        Subject-matter jurisdiction is a threshold question.

Therefore, we will first address the commissioners\ncourt\u2019s claim that Section 152.0165 of the Local Government Code is a bar to Grant\u2019s suit.

If the relevant evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the\njurisdictional issue, a district court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law.\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n       Here, as a matter of law, Grant\u2019s pleadings show that no salary grievance committee\nhearing was either requested or held for fiscal year 2008\u20132009. As far as fiscal year 2009\u20132010\nis concerned, Grant pleaded that he did not know about the budget for his office for that fiscal\nyear until he went to a budget hearing on September 14, 2009. At that hearing, Grant requested a\nsalary increase. The commissioners court tabled consideration of Grant\u2019s salary request.\n       Grant left that meeting and prepared a written request for a hearing before the Navarro\nCounty salary grievance committee. Later that afternoon, he took the request to Navarro County\nCommissioners James Olsen and Faith Holt. Both Olsen and Holt told Grant that there was no\nsalary grievance committee in Navarro County. Grant took his request to the county judge\u2019s\noffice. The county judge\u2019s secretary told him that there was no salary grievance committee in\nNavarro County because it had not been completely formed.\n       The Navarro County salary grievance committee had not been completely formed\nbecause the public members of the committee had not been selected. When complete, a salary\ngrievance committee is composed of nine voting members. TEX. LOC. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN.\n\u00a7 152.014 (West 2008). The county judge is the nonvoting chairman of a salary grievance\ncommittee. Id. \u00a7 152.014(b). Certain elected officials are voting members of the committee. Id.\n\u00a7 152.014(a)(1).    Additionally, the statute provides for the appointment of enough public\nmembers to bring the number of voting members to nine. Id. Or, the commissioners court may\nvote to use nine public members to constitute the committee. Id. \u00a7 152.014(a)(2). No public\nmembers had been appointed to the salary grievance committee in Navarro County for either of\n\n                                                 4\n\fthe fiscal years under review. The commissioners court maintains that, regardless of that fact,\nthe statute\u2019s requirements are clear\u2014not only must there be a request for a hearing, the hearing\nmust be held. Until both of the requirements are met, the district court is deprived of jurisdiction\nto hear and determine the matter.\n          The commissioners court is correct. As previously noted, Section 152.0165(a) provides:\n\u201cAn elected county or precinct officer may not file suit regarding the officer\u2019s salary or personal\nexpenses unless a hearing has been requested and held under Section 152.016\u201d (emphasis\nadded). Unlike other statutes that only require a claimant to initiate grievance proceedings, here\nthe request for a hearing and the hearing itself are both prerequisites to a suit.                                    Compare\nSection 152.0165 (claimant required to request a hearing before the grievance committee and\nhearing actually must be held), with TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 554.006 (West 2004) (claimant\nonly required to initiate grievance procedures under Whistleblower Act), and Univ. of Tex. Med.\nBranch at Galveston v.

Ass\u2019n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 443\u201344. Because\nthere was no hearing before a salary grievance committee on Grant\u2019s salary claims\u2014\njurisdictional prerequisites to suit\u2014the district court was without jurisdiction to hear them.1 The\ndistrict court was correct to grant the commissioners court\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction. Grant\u2019s sole\nissue on appeal is overruled.\n          The district court denied Grant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. Although Grant asked for\nthe award of attorney\u2019s fees in his prayer for relief in this court, he has not brought forward an\nissue on that point and has not briefed it.

It urges that one such limitation is found in Section 152.0165(a)\nof the Local Government Code.         \u201cAn elected county or precinct officer may not file suit\nregarding the officer\u2019s salary or personal expenses unless a hearing has been requested and held\nunder Section 152.016.\u201d        TEX. LOC. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 152.0165(a) (West 2008).\nSection 152.016 details the procedure for hearings in salary grievance matters. Id. \u00a7 152.016.\nThe commissioners court takes the position that a Section 152.016 hearing was never held for\neither fiscal year and that, because there was not, the district court was deprived of jurisdiction in\nthis case.\n        Subject-matter jurisdiction is a threshold question. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Parks & Wildlife v.\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004). Therefore, we will first address the commissioners\ncourt\u2019s claim that Section 152.0165 of the Local Government Code is a bar to Grant\u2019s suit. We\nfirst note that both a plea to the jurisdiction and a motion for summary judgment are appropriate\nfor challenging subject-matter jurisdiction. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554\n(Tex. 2000). Here, the commissioners court has challenged subject-matter jurisdiction through\nboth vehicles.\n\n                                                  3\n\f       To invoke the subject-matter jurisdiction of a court, the one bringing the claim must\nallege facts that affirmatively demonstrate that the court has jurisdiction to hear it. Miranda, 133\nS.W.3d at 226; Tex. Ass\u2019n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993). A\ndefendant will prevail on a plea to the jurisdiction if he shows an incurable jurisdictional defect\napparent from the face of the pleadings that makes it impossible for the plaintiff\u2019s petition to\nconfer jurisdiction on the district court. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226\u201327. Courts must consider\nevidence when necessary to decide jurisdictional issues.          Id. at 221; Tex. Natural Res.\nConservation Comm\u2019n v. White, 46 S.W.3d 864, 868 (Tex. 2001); Bland Indep. Sch. Dist., 34\nS.W.3d at 554\u201355. If the relevant evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the\njurisdictional issue, a district court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law.\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n       Here, as a matter of law, Grant\u2019s pleadings show that no salary grievance committee\nhearing was either requested or held for fiscal year 2008\u20132009. As far as fiscal year 2009\u20132010\nis concerned, Grant pleaded that he did not know about the budget for his office for that fiscal\nyear until he went to a budget hearing on September 14, 2009. At that hearing, Grant requested a\nsalary increase. The commissioners court tabled consideration of Grant\u2019s salary request.\n       Grant left that meeting and prepared a written request for a hearing before the Navarro\nCounty salary grievance committee. Later that afternoon, he took the request to Navarro County\nCommissioners James Olsen and Faith Holt. Both Olsen and Holt told Grant that there was no\nsalary grievance committee in Navarro County. Grant took his request to the county judge\u2019s\noffice. The county judge\u2019s secretary told him that there was no salary grievance committee in\nNavarro County because it had not been completely formed.\n       The Navarro County salary grievance committee had not been completely formed\nbecause the public members of the committee had not been selected. When complete, a salary\ngrievance committee is composed of nine voting members. TEX. LOC. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN.\n\u00a7 152.014 (West 2008). The county judge is the nonvoting chairman of a salary grievance\ncommittee. Id. \u00a7 152.014(b). Certain elected officials are voting members of the committee. Id.\n\u00a7 152.014(a)(1).    Additionally, the statute provides for the appointment of enough public\nmembers to bring the number of voting members to nine. Id. Or, the commissioners court may\nvote to use nine public members to constitute the committee. Id. \u00a7 152.014(a)(2). No public\nmembers had been appointed to the salary grievance committee in Navarro County for either of\n\n                                                 4\n\fthe fiscal years under review. The commissioners court maintains that, regardless of that fact,\nthe statute\u2019s requirements are clear\u2014not only must there be a request for a hearing, the hearing\nmust be held. Until both of the requirements are met, the district court is deprived of jurisdiction\nto hear and determine the matter.\n          The commissioners court is correct. As previously noted, Section 152.0165(a) provides:\n\u201cAn elected county or precinct officer may not file suit regarding the officer\u2019s salary or personal\nexpenses unless a hearing has been requested and held under Section 152.016\u201d (emphasis\nadded). Unlike other statutes that only require a claimant to initiate grievance proceedings, here\nthe request for a hearing and the hearing itself are both prerequisites to a suit.                                    Compare\nSection 152.0165 (claimant required to request a hearing before the grievance committee and\nhearing actually must be held), with TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 554.006 (West 2004) (claimant\nonly required to initiate grievance procedures under Whistleblower Act), and Univ. of Tex. Med.\nBranch at Galveston v. Barrett, 159 S.W.3d 631, 632 (Tex. 2005) (\u201cSection 554.006 does not\nrequire that grievance or appeal procedures be exhausted before suit can be filed; rather, it\nrequires that such procedures be timely initiated . . . .\u201d). Such prerequisites are a matter of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction. \u201cStatutory prerequisites to a suit . . . are jurisdictional requirements\nin all suits against a governmental entity.\u201d TEX. GOV\u2019T CODE ANN. \u00a7 311.034 (West Supp.\n2011).\n          Subject-matter jurisdiction is \u201cessential to the authority of a court to decide a case\u201d and\n\u201cis never presumed and cannot be waived.\u201d Tex. Ass\u2019n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at 443\u201344. Because\nthere was no hearing before a salary grievance committee on Grant\u2019s salary claims\u2014\njurisdictional prerequisites to suit\u2014the district court was without jurisdiction to hear them.1 The\ndistrict court was correct to grant the commissioners court\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction. Grant\u2019s sole\nissue on appeal is overruled.\n          The district court denied Grant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. Although Grant asked for\nthe award of attorney\u2019s fees in his prayer for relief in this court, he has not brought forward an\nissue on that point and has not briefed it. Therefore, we need not consider the award of\nattorney\u2019s fees. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1.\n\n\n          1\n           Although the availability of such an order is not before us, we note that, when Grant found out that there was no salary\ngrievance committee in Navarro County, he did not attempt to invoke the supervisory power of the district court in an effort to\nget the district court to order the commissioners court to perform their mandatory, nondiscretionary duty to organize fully the\nsalary grievance committee so that he could have a hearing before them.\n\n                                                                5\n\f       The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      JIM R.
