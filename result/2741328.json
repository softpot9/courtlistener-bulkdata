Ihlenfeld, II, United\nStates Attorney, Jarod J. Douglas, Assistant United States\nAttorney, Martinsburg, West Virginia, for Appellee.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n            Theofanis Mavroudis pled guilty to failure to register\n\nas a sex offender, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250(a) (2012).\n\nHe was sentenced to sixty-three months\u2019 imprisonment, to run\n\nconsecutively to any future state or federal sentence, followed\n\nby   a    lifetime      of    supervised        release.          Mavroudis     appeals,\n\nchallenging       his   sentence.        For     the    reasons     that    follow,     we\n\naffirm.\n\n            We review a sentence for reasonableness, applying a\n\n\u201cdeferential       abuse-of-discretion           standard.\u201d          Gall     v.    United\n\nStates, 552 U.S. 38, 52 (2007).                  We first consider whether the\n\nsentencing     court         committed      \u201csignificant          procedural       error,\u201d\n\nincluding     improper         calculation        of    the       Guidelines        range,\n\ninsufficient      consideration        of   the    18   U.S.C.      \u00a7 3553(a)       (2012)\n\nfactors,    and    inadequate      explanation         of   the    sentence        imposed.\n\nId. at 51; see United States v. Lynn, 592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th\n\nCir. 2010).         In assessing Guidelines calculations, we review\n\nfactual findings for clear error, legal conclusions de novo, and\n\nunpreserved       arguments      for     plain    error.           United     States    v.\n\nStrieper, 666 F.3d 288, 292 (4th Cir. 2012).\n\n            If we find the sentence procedurally reasonable, we\n\nalso consider its substantive reasonableness under the totality\n\nof the circumstances.             Lynn, 592 F.3d at 578.                   The sentence\n\nimposed must be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to\n\n                                            2\n\fcomply with the purposes\u201d of sentencing.                      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\n\nWe    presume    on    appeal    that    a       within-Guidelines          sentence    is\n\nsubstantively reasonable, and the defendant bears the burden to\n\n\u201crebut the presumption by demonstrating that the sentence is\n\nunreasonable       when     measured    against        the    \u00a7 3553(a)        factors.\u201d\n\nUnited    States      v.   Montes-Pineda,        445   F.3d    375,   379     (4th     Cir.\n\n2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n             Mavroudis      raises     two       challenges     to    his    Guidelines\n\ncalculations.         He first asserts that the district court erred in\n\nimposing an eight-level upward adjustment to his base offense\n\nlevel for commission of a sex offense against a minor while in\n\nfailure     to   register     status.        See    U.S.     Sentencing       Guidelines\n\nManual (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2A3.5(b)(1)(C) (2012).                      For the purposes of\n\nthis Guideline, \u201csex offense\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as\n\n\u201ca criminal offense that has an element involving a sexual act\n\nor sexual contact with another.\u201d                   42 U.S.C \u00a7 16911(5) (2012);\n\nsee USSG \u00a7 2A3.5 cmt. n.1.              \u201cMinor\u201d is defined to include \u201can\n\nindividual who had not attained the age of 18 years.\u201d                                  USSG\n\n\u00a7 2A3.5 cmt. n.1.          The Guideline does not require conviction of\n\nsuch an offense, but only its commission, to qualify a defendant\n\nfor   the   enhancement.        United       States    v.     Lott,   750     F.3d     214,\n\n220-21 (2d Cir. 2014).\n\n             Mavroudis also asserts that the district court erred\n\nin imposing a two-level upward adjustment for vulnerable victim.\n\n                                             3\n\fThe    Guidelines        provide    for    a    two-level         enhancement    when     the\n\ndefendant     \u201cknew       or     should   have      known    that     a    victim    of   the\n\noffense      was    a    vulnerable       victim.\u201d          USSG    \u00a7 3A1.1(b)(1).         A\n\n\u201cvulnerable victim\u201d is defined as \u201ca victim of the offense of\n\nconviction         and     any     conduct      for       which     the     defendant      is\n\naccountable under [USSG] \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct) . . . who is\n\nunusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition,\n\nor who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal\n\nconduct.\u201d         USSG \u00a7 3A1.1 cmt. n.2.\n\n              We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s\n\nimposition of these enhancements.                       The testimony at sentencing\n\namply supported the court\u2019s findings that Mavroudis committed\n\nthe West Virginia offense of sexual abuse in the third degree,\n\nsee W. Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 61-8B-1(6), 61-8B-9(a) (2013), and that the\n\nvictim of this offense qualifies as a vulnerable victim under\n\nUSSG     \u00a7 3A1.1.          Moreover,       we      find     unpersuasive        Mavroudis\u2019\n\nargument that the vulnerable victim enhancement could not apply\n\nto    his   failure       to   register    offense.          See    USSG    \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1)\n\n(defining \u201crelevant conduct\u201d to include \u201call acts and omissions\n\ncommitted . . . by the defendant . . . that occurred during the\n\ncommission of the offense of conviction.\u201d); cf. United States v.\n\nMyers,      598    F.3d    474     (8th   Cir.      2010)    (finding       prior     sexual\n\nassault      that       predated    failure        to    register     offense       was   not\n\nrelevant conduct).\n\n                                               4\n\f              Mavroudis       next    asserts        that    his    lifetime     term   of\n\nsupervised      release       is      both    procedurally          and    substantively\n\nunreasonable,       because        the    court      failed    to    provide     adequate\n\nreasoning     to   justify      the      sentence,     and    it    is    unsupported    by\n\nfacts in the record.               However, the district court provided a\n\nclear, if brief, explanation of its reasons for imposing the\n\nterm\u2014specifically focusing on the need to protect the community\n\nand   other    vulnerable       victims,       due    to    Mavroudis\u2019       demonstrated\n\nrecidivism, and to provide needed treatment.                         We conclude these\n\nreasons adequately support the court\u2019s decision to impose such a\n\nsentence.      Moreover, insofar as Mavroudis seeks to challenge the\n\nsubstantive reasonableness of his sentence of imprisonment, he\n\nfails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded this\n\nsentence.      See Montes-Pineda, 445 F.3d at 379.\n\n              Finally,    Mavroudis          asserts    that       the    district   court\n\nlacked discretion to order that his sentence run consecutively\n\nto any future state or federal sentence.                      Mavroudis specifically\n\nrelies on United States v. Smith, 472 F.3d 222, 226 (4th Cir.\n\n2006) (holding, based upon the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a)\n\n(2012),   that      a    district        court     \u201ccannot     impose      its   sentence\n\nconsecutively to a sentence that does not yet exist\u201d).                             However,\n\nthe   Supreme      Court\u2019s      subsequent         ruling     in    Setser    v.     United\n\nStates,   132      S.   Ct.    1463      (2012),     implicitly      overruled       Smith.\n\nTherefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\n                                              5\n\frunning   the    sentence     consecutively    to   Mavroudis\u2019    unimposed\n\nsentences.\n\n           Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.\n\nWe   dispense   with   oral   argument   because    the   facts   and   legal\n\ncontentions     are   adequately   presented   in   the   materials     before\n\nthis court and argument would not aid the decisional process.\n\n\n\n                                                                   AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                     6\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                            UNPUBLISHED\n\n                  UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                      FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n                            No. 14-4201\n\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                Plaintiff \u2013 Appellee,\n\n          v.\n\nTHEOFANIS MAVROUDIS,\n\n                Defendant - Appellant.\n\n\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of West Virginia, at Martinsburg.

For the purposes of\n\nthis Guideline, \u201csex offense\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as\n\n\u201ca criminal offense that has an element involving a sexual act\n\nor sexual contact with another.\u201d                   42 U.S.C \u00a7 16911(5) (2012);\n\nsee USSG \u00a7 2A3.5 cmt. n.1.              \u201cMinor\u201d is defined to include \u201can\n\nindividual who had not attained the age of 18 years.\u201d                                  USSG\n\n\u00a7 2A3.5 cmt. n.1.

The testimony at sentencing\n\namply supported the court\u2019s findings that Mavroudis committed\n\nthe West Virginia offense of sexual abuse in the third degree,\n\nsee W. Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 61-8B-1(6), 61-8B-9(a) (2013), and that the\n\nvictim of this offense qualifies as a vulnerable victim under\n\nUSSG     \u00a7 3A1.1.

We conclude these\n\nreasons adequately support the court\u2019s decision to impose such a\n\nsentence.      Moreover, insofar as Mavroudis seeks to challenge the\n\nsubstantive reasonableness of his sentence of imprisonment, he\n\nfails to rebut the presumption of reasonableness accorded this\n\nsentence.
