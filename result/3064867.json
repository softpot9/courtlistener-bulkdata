MUCOS PHARMA            8197\nconsidering a motion to enter a preliminary injunction requir-\ning a product recall in a trademark infringement case. We join\nthe Third Circuit in requiring that a district court must find a\nsubstantial risk of danger to the public or other special cir-\ncumstances in order to enter an interlocutory order recalling\na product in a trademark infringement case.\n\n                               I\n\n   This case involves a dispute between two nutraceutical\ncompanies concerning the enzyme-based dietary supplement\nWobenzym, originally produced and sold by the German cor-\nporation Mucos Pharma GmbH & Co. (\u201cMucos\u201d). Dr. Karl\nRansberger developed Wobenzym and owned Mucos until his\ndeath in 2001. Wobenzym is federally trademarked.1 In the\nlate 1980s, Ransberger met Joachim Lehmann, today the CEO\nof Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. (\u201cMarlyn\u201d). Ransberger\nacquired a 50% ownership interest in Marlyn in exchange for\nallowing Marlyn to exclusively distribute Wobenzym in the\nUnited States. From 1991 to 2006, Marlyn distributed Woben-\nzym in the United States for Mucos. Marlyn sold Wobenzym\nin labels that prominently displayed Mucos\u2019s trademark.\nMucos sold over $25 million of Wobenzym to American cus-\ntomers.\n\n   When Ransberger died in 2001, problems arose between\nMucos and Marlyn. Mucos and Marlyn resolved these prob-\nlems in a 2002 Settlement Agreement. Section 13 of the Set-\ntlement Agreement contained the terms of a distributorship\narrangement (\u201cDistributorship Provision\u201d). The Distributor-\nship Provision provided that \u201c[w]ithin 30 days after the Effec-\ntive Date, MUCOS and Marlyn shall use their good faith\n  1\n   Mucos developed two distinct products: WOBENZYM\u00ae and\nWOBENZYM\u00aeN. It developed WOBENZYM\u00ae in the 1960s and\nWOBENZYM\u00aeN in 1991. WOBENZYM\u00ae was a formulation of seven\nenzymes; WOBENZYM\u00aeN contained five enzymes. This opinion refers\nto WOBENZYM\u00aeN as simply \u201cWobenzym.\u201d\n\f8198      MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA\nefforts to enter into a formal distributorship agreement con-\ntaining the following terms and such other terms as may be\nmutually agreed to or are customary in the industry.\u201d No such\nformal agreement was ever executed.\n\n   The Distributorship Provision provided that, under the\nfuture distributorship agreement, Marlyn was to be the exclu-\nsive distributor of Wobenzym and two other supplements in\nthe United States for a period of ten years, with a five-year\nextension option. The Distributorship Provision stated that if\nMucos ceased production of Wobenzym, Marlyn would have\n\u201can exclusive . . . non-transferable, non-sublicensable license\n. . . to manufacture [Wobenzym] within the United States\u201d\nand sell the Wobenzym it manufactures.\n\n   In 2006, Marlyn submitted purchase orders to Mucos but\nrefused to take delivery because it believed that Mucos had\nchanged the product. Marlyn had requested and received a\nbatch weighing sheet from Mucos which revealed a difference\nbetween the actual amount of certain active ingredients and\nthe amount listed on Wobenzym\u2019s product label.\n\n   Marlyn construed the discrepancy between the actual\namounts of the ingredients and the stated amounts as indica-\ntion that Mucos had ceased producing Wobenzym. Marlyn\nbelieved that, according to the Distributorship Provision, it\nhad the right to begin manufacturing Wobenzym and selling\nit under the Wobenzym label. In March of 2007 it began\ndoing just that. Mucos claims that Marlyn\u2019s Wobenzym for-\nmula differed from Mucos\u2019s formula, causing confusion and\ninfringing on Mucos\u2019s trademark.\n\n  Mucos brought this action for trademark infringement and\nrequested a preliminary injunction to stop Marlyn from selling\nWobenzym with the Wobernzym mark. The district court\nheard testimony from Marlyn\u2019s and Mucos\u2019s experts as well\nas their executive officers.\n\f           MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA            8199\n   On November 13, 2007, the district court granted Mucos\u2019s\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. It ordered Marlyn to stop\nselling Wobenzym, recall the Wobenzym that it had already\nsold, and provide restitution to those customers who had\nbought Marlyn\u2019s Wobenzym.\n\n   On November 16, three days after the district court issued\nthe preliminary injunction and seven days after the hearing\nended, Marlyn moved to introduce three new pieces of evi-\ndence and requested that the court reconsider its decision. The\ndistrict court declined to admit the evidence or reconsider its\ndecision.\n\n   Marlyn appeals the preliminary injunction, the scope of the\ninjunction, and the court\u2019s decision not to reconsider its deci-\nsion in light of new evidence.\n\n                               II\n\n   We review a district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunc-\ntion for an abuse of discretion. Freecycle Network, Inc. v.\nOey, 505 F.3d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 2007). \u201c[O]ur inquiry is at\nan end once we determine that the district court employed the\nappropriate legal standards which govern the issuance of a\npreliminary injunction, and . . . correctly apprehended the law\nwith respect to the underlying issues in litigation.\u201d Harris v.\nBd. of Supervisors, 366 F.3d 754, 760 (9th Cir. 2004) (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). We review the scope of a pre-\nliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. United States\nv. Schiff, 379 F.3d 621, 625 (9th Cir. 2004). We affirm the\nissuance of the preliminary injunction but vacate the injunc-\ntion because of its scope and remand for further proceedings.\n\n   We emphasize that this case comes before us on review of\na preliminary injunction. Because our review of a preliminary\ninjunction is limited to \u201cthe law applied by the district court\nand because the fully developed factual record may be materi-\nally different from that initially before the district court, our\n\f8200       MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA\ndisposition of appeals from most preliminary injunctions may\nprovide little guidance as to the appropriate disposition on the\nmerits.\u201d Sports Form, Inc. v. United Press Int\u2019l, Inc., 686 F.2d\n750, 753 (9th Cir. 1982).\n\n                                 A\n\n   [1] \u201cA plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must\nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is\nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary\nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an\ninjunction is in the public interest.\u201d Winter v. Natural Res.\nDef. Council, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 365, 374 (2008).\n\n   [2] The district court properly considered each of these fac-\ntors. In considering the likelihood of success on the merits,\nthe court correctly held that to be liable for trademark\ninfringement, someone must \u201c(1) use in commerce (2) any\nword, false designation of origin, false or misleading descrip-\ntion, or representation of fact, which (3) is likely to cause con-\nfusion or misrepresents the characteristics of his or another\nperson\u2019s goods or services.\u201d Freecycle, 505 F.3d at 902. The\ncourt properly cited the factors listed in AMF Inc. v. Sleek-\ncraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348-49 (9th Cir. 1979), to deter-\nmine the likelihood of confusion for the Wobenzym mark.\n\n   [3] In evaluating irreparable harm, the court cited Ninth\nCircuit law holding that \u201c[i]n a trademark infringement claim,\n\u2018irreparable injury may be presumed from a showing of likeli-\nhood of success on the merits.\u2019 \u201d El Pollo Loco, Inc. v.\nHashim, 316 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting\nGoTo.com, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., 202 F.3d 1199, 1205 n.4\n(9th Cir. 2000)). Because the court found a likelihood of suc-\ncess on the merits, it reasonably presumed irreparable injury.\nThe court similarly did not abuse its discretion when it evalu-\nated the balance of hardships or public interest.2\n  2\n   Marlyn claims that the district court improperly required Marlyn to\nshow that Mucos had ceased manufacturing its old Wobenzym formula-\n\f            MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA                     8201\n                                    B\n\n   As an affirmative defense to Mucos\u2019s trademark infringe-\nment claim, Marlyn argues that its manufacture and sale of\nWobenzym using Mucos\u2019s mark is justified because of the\nterms laid out in the Distributorship Provision. Under that\nprovision, Marlyn would acquire a license to use Mucos\u2019s\nmark if Mucos ever ceased production of Wobenzym. To suc-\nceed in its affirmative defense, Marlyn must show first that\nthe Distributorship Provision was enforceable and second that\nMucos ceased production of Wobenzym. We need not deter-\nmine whether the Distributorship Provision was enforceable\nunder Arizona law because we see no clear error in the district\ncourt\u2019s factual determination that Mucos never ceased pro-\nduction of Wobenzym. For the sake of the cessation analysis,\nwe assume without deciding that the Distributorship Provision\nwas enforceable.\n\n   Marlyn argues that because Mucos\u2019s formulation of the\nWobenzym supplement in 2006 did not conform to the\nWobenzym label, Mucos constructively stopped producing\nWobenzym. Mucos counters that this discrepancy is unimpor-\ntant because Mucos merely standardized the enzyme levels\naround their activity level per milligram rather than their input\nweight, a procedure Mucos claims is a \u201ccommon practice.\u201d\nMarlyn relied on the testimony of Dr. Scavetta, its director of\nlaboratory operations, to argue that both enzyme activity level\nand input weight are important.\n\ntion for distribution in the United States. Mucos had the burden of proving\nonly the four factors that justify a preliminary injunction; that burden was\nproperly laid by the district court. Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.,\n508 F.3d 1146, 1158 (9th Cir. 2007). Marlyn\u2019s argument that Mucos had\nceased production was an affirmative defense that Marlyn, not Mucos, had\nthe burden of showing. Id. (\u201c[O]nce the moving party has carried its bur-\nden of showing a likelihood of success on the merits, the burden shifts to\nthe nonmoving party to show a likelihood that its affirmative defense will\nsucceed.\u201d (citing Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do\nVegetal, 546 U.S. 418, 429 (2006))).\n\f8202       MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA\n   The district court held that the change in the Wobenzym\nformula was not significant enough to constitute cessation of\nproduction because the new formula maintained the desired\nlevel of enzymatic activity per milligram. The district court\ndid not find Dr. Scavetta\u2019s testimony credible and noted mul-\ntiple contradictions in his testimony.\n\n   When a district court uses extrinsic evidence to interpret a\ncontract, we review its findings of fact for clear error. DP Avi-\nation v. Smiths Indus. Aerospace & Def. Sys. Ltd., 268 F.3d\n829, 836 (9th Cir. 2001). Review for clear error is signifi-\ncantly deferential and requires a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\nthat a mistake has been committed.\u201d Easley v. Cromartie, 532\nU.S. 234, 242 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]f\nthe district court\u2019s findings are plausible in light of the record\nviewed in its entirety, the appellate court cannot reverse even\nif it is convinced it would have found differently.\u201d Husain v.\nOlympic Airways, 316 F.3d 829, 835 (9th Cir. 2002), aff\u2019d,\n540 U.S. 644 (2004). Additionally, we pay special deference\nto a trial court\u2019s credibility findings. Anderson v. Bessemer\nCity, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985).\n\n   [4] We see no reason to disturb the district court\u2019s finding.\nMarlyn did not meet its burden in proving its defense because\nit did not show that the change in question constituted a cessa-\ntion of production. Trademark owners are permitted to make\nsmall changes to their products without abandoning their\nmarks:\n\n    A change in the type, formula or blend of a product\n    sold under the same mark will probably not consti-\n    tute abandonment of the rights in the old mark. For\n    example, no abandonment occurred as a result of: a\n    change in the blend of tobacco; in a formulation of\n    paint; a change in the type of wheat used in flour; or\n    even a change in the performers and nature of a\n    musical performing group.\n\f          MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v.

The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion\nthat Mucos\u2019s changes did not significantly alter the product\nbecause it held nearly constant the activity levels of the\nenzymes, which were the most important component of the\nproduct.\n\n  [5] For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did\nnot clearly err in finding, based on evidence and testimony\nadmitted thus far, that Mucos did not cease production of\nWobenzym and that Marlyn did not have the right to use\nMucos\u2019s mark.\n\n                               C\n\n   Marlyn also challenges the scope of the injunctive relief\nprovided by the district court. The district court ordered Mar-\nlyn to stop manufacturing and distributing its Wobenzym\nproduct, recall its already-distributed products, and provide\nrestitution to its Wobenzym customers.\n\n   [6] A preliminary injunction can take two forms. A prohibi-\ntory injunction prohibits a party from taking action and \u201cpre-\nserve[s] the status quo pending a determination of the action\non the merits.\u201d Chalk v. U.S. Dist. Court, 840 F.2d 701, 704\n(9th Cir. 1988); see also Heckler v. Lopez, 463 U.S. 1328,\n1333 (1983) (a prohibitory injunction \u201cfreezes the positions of\nthe parties until the court can hear the case on the merits\u201d).\nA mandatory injunction \u201corders a responsible party to \u2018take\naction.\u2019 \u201d Meghrig v. KFC W., Inc., 516 U.S. 479, 484 (1996).\nA mandatory injunction \u201c \u2018goes well beyond simply maintain-\ning the status quo [p]endente lite [and] is particularly disfa-\nvored.\u2019 \u201d Anderson v. United States, 612 F.2d 1112, 1114 (9th\nCir. 1980) (quoting Martinez v. Mathews, 544 F.2d 1233,\n1243 (5th Cir. 1976)). In general, mandatory injunctions \u201care\nnot granted unless extreme or very serious damage will result\nand are not issued in doubtful cases or where the injury com-\n\f8204       MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA\nplained of is capable of compensation in damages.\u201d Id. at\n1115 (quoting Clune v. Publishers\u2019 Ass\u2019n of N.Y. City, 214 F.\nSupp. 520, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 1963)).\n\n   [7] The status quo ante litem referenced in Chalk means\n\u201c \u2018the last, uncontested status which preceded the pending\ncontroversy.\u2019 \u201d Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Am. Broad.\nCos., 747 F.2d 511, 514 (9th Cir. 1984) (quoting Tanner\nMotor Livery, Ltd. v. Avis, Inc., 316 F.2d 804, 809 (9th Cir.\n1963)). In this case, Marlyn had distributed its own version of\nWobenzym prior to the lawsuit. The district court ordered that\nMarlyn recall its product and give restitution to customers\nwho had bought its product. That remedy went beyond the\nstatus quo pending litigation and instead required Marlyn to\ntake the affirmative step of recalling its product. Thus, the\nrecall order at issue did not operate simply to preserve the sta-\ntus quo, or to restrain Marlyn from further acts of possible\ninfringement, because it involved products no longer within\nMarlyn\u2019s possession. In short, the district court\u2019s order was\nsomething more than a prohibitory preliminary injunction.\n\n   [8] The Third Circuit has considered similar circumstances\nand concluded that a district court considering a motion for a\npreliminary injunction directing recall of a product in a trade-\nmark infringement case should consider additional factors in\nassessing the request. Gucci Am., Inc. v. Daffy\u2019s, Inc., 354\nF.3d 228, 233 (3d Cir. 2003); see also United States v. Spec-\ntro Foods Corp., 544 F.2d 1175, 1181 (3d Cir. 1976); Theo-\ndore C. Max, Total Recall: A Primer on a Drastic Form of\nEquitable Relief, 84 Trademark Rep. 325, 327 (1994). Under\nthe Third Circuit\u2019s formulation, to justify a recall, the\ninfringed company must first satisfy the traditional standard\nfor a prohibitory preliminary injunction. In addition, the dis-\ntrict court must consider three further factors:\n\n    (1) the willful or intentional infringement by the\n    defendant; (2) whether the risk of confusion to the\n    public and injury to the trademark owner is greater\n\f           MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA              8205\n    than the burden of the recall to the defendant; and (3)\n    substantial risk of danger to the public due to the\n    defendant\u2019s infringing activity.\n\nGucci, 354 F.3d at 233.\n\n   [9] Given the nature of the requested remedy, we conclude\nthat the Third Circuit\u2019s formulation is sound, and we join it\nin requiring the district court to consider these factors before\ngranting a preliminary injunction directing product recall in a\ntrademark infringement case. If the district court makes a\nfinding that the infringing product causes a substantial risk of\ndanger to the public, it should order a recall.\n\n   As the district court did not have the benefit of this decision\nwhen deciding this case, it did not analyze these additional\nfactors. It did, however, rest its recall decision in part on the\nthird factor\u2014substantial risk of danger to the public due to the\ndefendant\u2019s infringing activity\u2014in concluding that there was\na public health hazard in allowing the product to remain on\nthe market. However, the record does not support the exis-\ntence of a public health risk necessary to invoke the interlocu-\ntory remedy of product recall. The only record support for the\nproposition that Marlyn\u2019s Wobenzym is unsafe for public\nconsumption is the testimony of Dr. Scavetta that the proteo-\nlytic activity in some batches of Marlyn\u2019s Wobenzym was\n250% greater than what it should have been. However, Sca-\nvetta did not testify that this formulation was unsafe for\nhuman consumption. Moreover, the district court stated that\nit did not find Dr. Scavetta\u2019s testimony to be credible. There\nwas no other testimony or evidence upon which the district\ncourt could make its conclusion that the product was hazard-\nous for public consumption.\n\n   [10] Therefore, we must vacate the district court\u2019s order\ninsofar as it requires product recall and restitution and remand\nthe issue for the district court\u2019s further consideration in light\nof this opinion.\n\f8206      MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA\n                              III\n\n   After the district court granted Mucos\u2019s motion for prelimi-\nnary injunction but before it issued its explanatory opinion,\nMarlyn submitted a post-hearing motion to introduce addi-\ntional evidence. The district court construed this motion as a\nrequest to reconsider its decision in light of Marlyn\u2019s new evi-\ndence. The district court denied Marlyn\u2019s motion. We review\nthe district court\u2019s denial of Marlyn\u2019s post-hearing motion for\nreconsideration for an abuse of discretion. MacDonald v.\nGrace Church Seattle, 457 F.3d 1079, 1081 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\n   \u201c[A] motion for reconsideration should not be granted,\nabsent highly unusual circumstances, unless the district court\nis presented with newly discovered evidence, committed clear\nerror, or if there is an intervening change in the controlling\nlaw.\u201d 389 Orange St. Partners v. Arnold, 179 F.3d 656, 665\n(9th Cir. 1999). A motion for reconsideration \u201cmay not be\nused to raise arguments or present evidence for the first time\nwhen they could reasonably have been raised earlier in the lit-\nigation.\u201d Kona Enters., Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, 229 F.3d 877,\n890 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\n   Marlyn requested that the district court reconsider its pre-\nliminary injunction in light of three new pieces of evidence:\n(1) a draft revised production and distribution license agree-\nment with Mucos; (2) the expert declaration of Dr. Lucia\nDesser; and (3) an additional declaration from Joachim Leh-\nmann. Each of these pieces of evidence could have been intro-\nduced earlier in the litigation.\n\n   First, Marlyn sought to introduce a draft contract between\nMucos and Marlyn prepared by Mucos in 2005. Marlyn\nargues that the draft \u201cunambiguously establishes that Section\n13 of the Settlement Agreement constitutes a valid and\nenforceable distribution agreement between the parties and\nhas been treated as such by them since its inception.\u201d Marlyn\nclaims to have discovered the draft shortly before the hearing\n\f           MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA               8207\nbut that the district court did not want to receive evidence on\nthe distribution agreement during the hearing.\n\n   [11] Although the district court stated that it did not want\nto consider the Settlement Agreement during the hearing, it\ndid not prohibit or even discourage Marlyn from submitting\nthe draft contract. The hearing concluded on November 9,\n2007, and the district court did not grant Mucos\u2019s motion for\npreliminary injunction until November 13, 2007. Marlyn\ncould have submitted the draft before the court made its deci-\nsion. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\ndenying Marlyn\u2019s motion to introduce the draft contract after\nthe court had already issued its opinion.\n\n   [12] Second, Marlyn sought to introduce the declaration of\nDr. Lucia Desser to rebut the testimony of Dr. Kreuger, a\npharmacy professor who testified about the production of\nnutritional supplements. Marlyn claims that it had no opportu-\nnity to rebut Krueger\u2019s testimony because Mucos had not pre-\nviously disclosed the testimony. However, Mucos had\nnotified Marlyn in the Joint Status Report that it intended to\ncall a witness who was \u201can expert to knowledge of one of\nordinary technical skill in the field of the production and anal-\nysis of nutritional supplements.\u201d From this description, Mar-\nlyn should have been prepared to rebut Dr. Kreuger\u2019s\ntestimony during cross-examination or during its direct exam-\nination of Dr. Scavetta. The district court did not abuse its dis-\ncretion in denying introduction of Dr. Desser\u2019s declaration.\n\n   [13] Finally, Marlyn sought to introduce a declaration of\nJoachim Lehmann. Lehmann\u2019s declaration reported on an\nemail he had received from an Austrian scientist \u201cconfirm-\n[ing] that there is no single . . . test for total proteolytic activ-\nity of enzyme combinations.\u201d Lehmann received the email on\nNovember 11. The district court did not decide on the prelimi-\nnary injunction until November 13. Marlyn could have intro-\nduced Lehmann\u2019s declaration before the district court made\nits decision, but did not. Thus, the district court did not abuse\n\f8208      MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA\nits discretion when it denied introduction of Mr. Lehmann\u2019s\ndeclaration.\n\n                              IV\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s\ngrant of a preliminary injunction and its denial of Marlyn\u2019s\nmotion to reconsider. We VACATE the district court\u2019s impo-\nsition of recall and restitution and REMAND for further pro-\nceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party shall bear its\nown costs on appeal.\n\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART;\nREMANDED.\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                FOR PUBLICATION\n UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n      FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\nMARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS, INC.,        \uf8fc      No. 08-15101\n             Plaintiff-Appellant,\n             v.                     \uf8fd        D.C.

MUCOS PHARMA            8197\nconsidering a motion to enter a preliminary injunction requir-\ning a product recall in a trademark infringement case. We join\nthe Third Circuit in requiring that a district court must find a\nsubstantial risk of danger to the public or other special cir-\ncumstances in order to enter an interlocutory order recalling\na product in a trademark infringement case.\n\n                               I\n\n   This case involves a dispute between two nutraceutical\ncompanies concerning the enzyme-based dietary supplement\nWobenzym, originally produced and sold by the German cor-\nporation Mucos Pharma GmbH & Co. (\u201cMucos\u201d). Dr. Karl\nRansberger developed Wobenzym and owned Mucos until his\ndeath in 2001. Wobenzym is federally trademarked.1 In the\nlate 1980s, Ransberger met Joachim Lehmann, today the CEO\nof Marlyn Nutraceuticals, Inc. (\u201cMarlyn\u201d). Ransberger\nacquired a 50% ownership interest in Marlyn in exchange for\nallowing Marlyn to exclusively distribute Wobenzym in the\nUnited States. From 1991 to 2006, Marlyn distributed Woben-\nzym in the United States for Mucos. Marlyn sold Wobenzym\nin labels that prominently displayed Mucos\u2019s trademark.\nMucos sold over $25 million of Wobenzym to American cus-\ntomers.\n\n   When Ransberger died in 2001, problems arose between\nMucos and Marlyn. Mucos and Marlyn resolved these prob-\nlems in a 2002 Settlement Agreement. Section 13 of the Set-\ntlement Agreement contained the terms of a distributorship\narrangement (\u201cDistributorship Provision\u201d). The Distributor-\nship Provision provided that \u201c[w]ithin 30 days after the Effec-\ntive Date, MUCOS and Marlyn shall use their good faith\n  1\n   Mucos developed two distinct products: WOBENZYM\u00ae and\nWOBENZYM\u00aeN. It developed WOBENZYM\u00ae in the 1960s and\nWOBENZYM\u00aeN in 1991. WOBENZYM\u00ae was a formulation of seven\nenzymes; WOBENZYM\u00aeN contained five enzymes. This opinion refers\nto WOBENZYM\u00aeN as simply \u201cWobenzym.\u201d\n\f8198      MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA\nefforts to enter into a formal distributorship agreement con-\ntaining the following terms and such other terms as may be\nmutually agreed to or are customary in the industry.\u201d No such\nformal agreement was ever executed.\n\n   The Distributorship Provision provided that, under the\nfuture distributorship agreement, Marlyn was to be the exclu-\nsive distributor of Wobenzym and two other supplements in\nthe United States for a period of ten years, with a five-year\nextension option. The Distributorship Provision stated that if\nMucos ceased production of Wobenzym, Marlyn would have\n\u201can exclusive . . . non-transferable, non-sublicensable license\n. . . to manufacture [Wobenzym] within the United States\u201d\nand sell the Wobenzym it manufactures.\n\n   In 2006, Marlyn submitted purchase orders to Mucos but\nrefused to take delivery because it believed that Mucos had\nchanged the product. Marlyn had requested and received a\nbatch weighing sheet from Mucos which revealed a difference\nbetween the actual amount of certain active ingredients and\nthe amount listed on Wobenzym\u2019s product label.\n\n   Marlyn construed the discrepancy between the actual\namounts of the ingredients and the stated amounts as indica-\ntion that Mucos had ceased producing Wobenzym. Marlyn\nbelieved that, according to the Distributorship Provision, it\nhad the right to begin manufacturing Wobenzym and selling\nit under the Wobenzym label. In March of 2007 it began\ndoing just that. Mucos claims that Marlyn\u2019s Wobenzym for-\nmula differed from Mucos\u2019s formula, causing confusion and\ninfringing on Mucos\u2019s trademark.\n\n  Mucos brought this action for trademark infringement and\nrequested a preliminary injunction to stop Marlyn from selling\nWobenzym with the Wobernzym mark. The district court\nheard testimony from Marlyn\u2019s and Mucos\u2019s experts as well\nas their executive officers.\n\f           MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA            8199\n   On November 13, 2007, the district court granted Mucos\u2019s\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. It ordered Marlyn to stop\nselling Wobenzym, recall the Wobenzym that it had already\nsold, and provide restitution to those customers who had\nbought Marlyn\u2019s Wobenzym.\n\n   On November 16, three days after the district court issued\nthe preliminary injunction and seven days after the hearing\nended, Marlyn moved to introduce three new pieces of evi-\ndence and requested that the court reconsider its decision. The\ndistrict court declined to admit the evidence or reconsider its\ndecision.\n\n   Marlyn appeals the preliminary injunction, the scope of the\ninjunction, and the court\u2019s decision not to reconsider its deci-\nsion in light of new evidence.\n\n                               II\n\n   We review a district court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunc-\ntion for an abuse of discretion.

MUCOS PHARMA                     8201\n                                    B\n\n   As an affirmative defense to Mucos\u2019s trademark infringe-\nment claim, Marlyn argues that its manufacture and sale of\nWobenzym using Mucos\u2019s mark is justified because of the\nterms laid out in the Distributorship Provision. Under that\nprovision, Marlyn would acquire a license to use Mucos\u2019s\nmark if Mucos ever ceased production of Wobenzym. To suc-\nceed in its affirmative defense, Marlyn must show first that\nthe Distributorship Provision was enforceable and second that\nMucos ceased production of Wobenzym. We need not deter-\nmine whether the Distributorship Provision was enforceable\nunder Arizona law because we see no clear error in the district\ncourt\u2019s factual determination that Mucos never ceased pro-\nduction of Wobenzym. For the sake of the cessation analysis,\nwe assume without deciding that the Distributorship Provision\nwas enforceable.\n\n   Marlyn argues that because Mucos\u2019s formulation of the\nWobenzym supplement in 2006 did not conform to the\nWobenzym label, Mucos constructively stopped producing\nWobenzym.

For\n    example, no abandonment occurred as a result of: a\n    change in the blend of tobacco; in a formulation of\n    paint; a change in the type of wheat used in flour; or\n    even a change in the performers and nature of a\n    musical performing group.\n\f          MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v.

The record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion\nthat Mucos\u2019s changes did not significantly alter the product\nbecause it held nearly constant the activity levels of the\nenzymes, which were the most important component of the\nproduct.\n\n  [5] For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did\nnot clearly err in finding, based on evidence and testimony\nadmitted thus far, that Mucos did not cease production of\nWobenzym and that Marlyn did not have the right to use\nMucos\u2019s mark.\n\n                               C\n\n   Marlyn also challenges the scope of the injunctive relief\nprovided by the district court.

In this case, Marlyn had distributed its own version of\nWobenzym prior to the lawsuit. The district court ordered that\nMarlyn recall its product and give restitution to customers\nwho had bought its product. That remedy went beyond the\nstatus quo pending litigation and instead required Marlyn to\ntake the affirmative step of recalling its product. Thus, the\nrecall order at issue did not operate simply to preserve the sta-\ntus quo, or to restrain Marlyn from further acts of possible\ninfringement, because it involved products no longer within\nMarlyn\u2019s possession. In short, the district court\u2019s order was\nsomething more than a prohibitory preliminary injunction.\n\n   [8] The Third Circuit has considered similar circumstances\nand concluded that a district court considering a motion for a\npreliminary injunction directing recall of a product in a trade-\nmark infringement case should consider additional factors in\nassessing the request.

Max, Total Recall: A Primer on a Drastic Form of\nEquitable Relief, 84 Trademark Rep. 325, 327 (1994). Under\nthe Third Circuit\u2019s formulation, to justify a recall, the\ninfringed company must first satisfy the traditional standard\nfor a prohibitory preliminary injunction. In addition, the dis-\ntrict court must consider three further factors:\n\n    (1) the willful or intentional infringement by the\n    defendant; (2) whether the risk of confusion to the\n    public and injury to the trademark owner is greater\n\f           MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA              8205\n    than the burden of the recall to the defendant; and (3)\n    substantial risk of danger to the public due to the\n    defendant\u2019s infringing activity.\n\nGucci, 354 F.3d at 233.\n\n   [9] Given the nature of the requested remedy, we conclude\nthat the Third Circuit\u2019s formulation is sound, and we join it\nin requiring the district court to consider these factors before\ngranting a preliminary injunction directing product recall in a\ntrademark infringement case. If the district court makes a\nfinding that the infringing product causes a substantial risk of\ndanger to the public, it should order a recall.\n\n   As the district court did not have the benefit of this decision\nwhen deciding this case, it did not analyze these additional\nfactors. It did, however, rest its recall decision in part on the\nthird factor\u2014substantial risk of danger to the public due to the\ndefendant\u2019s infringing activity\u2014in concluding that there was\na public health hazard in allowing the product to remain on\nthe market. However, the record does not support the exis-\ntence of a public health risk necessary to invoke the interlocu-\ntory remedy of product recall. The only record support for the\nproposition that Marlyn\u2019s Wobenzym is unsafe for public\nconsumption is the testimony of Dr. Scavetta that the proteo-\nlytic activity in some batches of Marlyn\u2019s Wobenzym was\n250% greater than what it should have been. However, Sca-\nvetta did not testify that this formulation was unsafe for\nhuman consumption. Moreover, the district court stated that\nit did not find Dr. Scavetta\u2019s testimony to be credible. There\nwas no other testimony or evidence upon which the district\ncourt could make its conclusion that the product was hazard-\nous for public consumption.\n\n   [10] Therefore, we must vacate the district court\u2019s order\ninsofar as it requires product recall and restitution and remand\nthe issue for the district court\u2019s further consideration in light\nof this opinion.\n\f8206      MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v.

Each of these pieces of evidence could have been intro-\nduced earlier in the litigation.\n\n   First, Marlyn sought to introduce a draft contract between\nMucos and Marlyn prepared by Mucos in 2005. Marlyn\nargues that the draft \u201cunambiguously establishes that Section\n13 of the Settlement Agreement constitutes a valid and\nenforceable distribution agreement between the parties and\nhas been treated as such by them since its inception.\u201d Marlyn\nclaims to have discovered the draft shortly before the hearing\n\f           MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA               8207\nbut that the district court did not want to receive evidence on\nthe distribution agreement during the hearing.\n\n   [11] Although the district court stated that it did not want\nto consider the Settlement Agreement during the hearing, it\ndid not prohibit or even discourage Marlyn from submitting\nthe draft contract. The hearing concluded on November 9,\n2007, and the district court did not grant Mucos\u2019s motion for\npreliminary injunction until November 13, 2007. Marlyn\ncould have submitted the draft before the court made its deci-\nsion. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\ndenying Marlyn\u2019s motion to introduce the draft contract after\nthe court had already issued its opinion.\n\n   [12] Second, Marlyn sought to introduce the declaration of\nDr. Lucia Desser to rebut the testimony of Dr. Kreuger, a\npharmacy professor who testified about the production of\nnutritional supplements. Marlyn claims that it had no opportu-\nnity to rebut Krueger\u2019s testimony because Mucos had not pre-\nviously disclosed the testimony. However, Mucos had\nnotified Marlyn in the Joint Status Report that it intended to\ncall a witness who was \u201can expert to knowledge of one of\nordinary technical skill in the field of the production and anal-\nysis of nutritional supplements.\u201d From this description, Mar-\nlyn should have been prepared to rebut Dr. Kreuger\u2019s\ntestimony during cross-examination or during its direct exam-\nination of Dr. Scavetta. The district court did not abuse its dis-\ncretion in denying introduction of Dr. Desser\u2019s declaration.\n\n   [13] Finally, Marlyn sought to introduce a declaration of\nJoachim Lehmann. Lehmann\u2019s declaration reported on an\nemail he had received from an Austrian scientist \u201cconfirm-\n[ing] that there is no single . . . test for total proteolytic activ-\nity of enzyme combinations.\u201d Lehmann received the email on\nNovember 11. The district court did not decide on the prelimi-\nnary injunction until November 13. Marlyn could have intro-\nduced Lehmann\u2019s declaration before the district court made\nits decision, but did not. Thus, the district court did not abuse\n\f8208      MARLYN NUTRACEUTICALS v. MUCOS PHARMA\nits discretion when it denied introduction of Mr. Lehmann\u2019s\ndeclaration.\n\n                              IV\n\n   For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s\ngrant of a preliminary injunction and its denial of Marlyn\u2019s\nmotion to reconsider.
