A stroke left her incompetent. After the stroke, she became an inpatient at petitioner and defendant Alcott Rehabilitation Hospital (Alcott). Approximately 10 months after the stroke, both of plaintiffs legs were amputated as a result of Alcott's failure to provide her with proper care.</p>\n<p>Alcott petitions for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying a motion for summary adjudication and instead to enter an order granting the summary adjudication motion based on a determination that portions of plaintiffs causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5.</p>\n<p>We issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing. Having reviewed the pleadings and record, and having heard oral argument, we deny the relief requested. We conclude that the insanity tolling provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 352 applies to the one-year limitation period in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Facts.<sup>[1]</sup></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. First admission (November 18, 1998 to January 12, 1999).</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>On September 7, 1998, plaintiff, a woman over the age of 70, suffered a major stroke which paralyzed her right side and made it difficult for her to speak and swallow. The stroke left plaintiff incompetent, without basic physical or cognitive skills. She was disoriented and did not have the intellectual ability to comprehend what was occurring around her or to make decisions. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*809</span> She could not communicate verbally or take care of herself. She required assistance to perform daily tasks such as dressing, feeding, and personal hygiene. A gastric tube was inserted.</h2>\n<p>After the stroke, plaintiffs daughter, Renee Clark (Clark), became responsible for plaintiffs health care decisions.</p>\n<p>Approximately two months later, on November 18, 1998, plaintiff was transferred to the Alcott hospital, a licensed skilled nursing facility.</p>\n<p>On January 12, 1999, plaintiff was taken from Alcott's facility to a Kaiser hospital. Plaintiff was in a coma. She was diagnosed with profound dehydration and hyperosmolar coma. Her blood sugar was almost 1,000. She had severe sores on her heels. Photographs were taken of plaintiffs feet.</p>\n<p>While plaintiff was in the Kaiser hospital, a social worker notified her family that she believed plaintiffs condition was caused by severe neglect. On January 20, 1999, plaintiffs family ordered copies of plaintiffs medical records.</p>\n<p>Alcott's staff made representations to the family that proper care was being provided to plaintiff. Alcott's staff blamed an outside doctor for plaintiffs problems. Because of these representations, plaintiffs family did not suspect wrongdoing by Alcott until plaintiff again was removed from Alcott's care. Alcott had failed to monitor plaintiffs fluids and had failed to test plaintiffs blood-sugar levels.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Second admission (January 22, 1999 to May 1999 ).</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff remained in the Kaiser hospital until January 22, 1999, when she was returned to Alcott's hospital.</p>\n<p>In May 1999, plaintiff was transferred to the Westside Health Care Nursing Home Hospital.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>c. <i>Other events.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In July 1999, plaintiff was transferred back to the Kaiser hospital. While in the Kaiser hospital, in July 1999, both of plaintiffs legs were amputated because of gangrene.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Procedure.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On March 6, 2000, this action was filed against Alcott by Clark, plaintiffs guardian ad litem.<sup>[2]</sup> As against Alcott, the complaint identified two causes of action: (1) elder abuse and neglect, and (2) medical malpractice.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>Alcott filed a motion for summary adjudication. Alcott did not admit that any of its acts caused plaintiffs injuries. For purposes of the motion, Alcott accepted plaintiffs theory of liability that Alcott's failure to monitor plaintiffs fluids and failure to test her blood-sugar level caused plaintiffs injuries. In the motion, Alcott sought to eliminate all allegations of wrongful conduct occurring on or before January 12, 1999. Alcott contended that by January 20, 1999, when copies of plaintiffs medical records were ordered, a reasonable person would have been suspicious of wrongdoing. Alcott argued the one-year statute of limitations barred the wrongful acts and omissions occurring on or before January 12, 1999, which would have included all acts taking place during the first admission. If granted, plaintiff could have litigated only the alleged <span class=\"star-pagination\">*810</span> wrongful conduct committed by Alcott that occurred during the second admission.</p>\n<p>In the summary adjudication motion, Alcott stated that the applicable statute of limitations was Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5, the statute of limitations applicable to health care providers. Alcott argued that a motion for summary adjudication (Code Civ. Proa, \u00a7 437c, subd. (f)) could properly be used to resolve part of the dispute because plaintiff alleged multiple wrongful acts or omissions.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff opposed the motion. Relying upon <i>Belton v. Bowers Ambulance Service</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133480/belton-v-bowers-ambulance-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133480/belton-v-bowers-ambulance-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Shahhal</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2300663\"><a href=\"/opinion/2300663/bennett-v-shahhal/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span> (<i>Bennett</i>), to argue that the tolling provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 352 was not applicable to the one-year limitation period in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5.</p>\n<p>The trial court denied Alcott's motion for summary adjudication. The trial court held that the action was filed within the one-year statute of limitations (Code Civ. Proa, \u00a7 340.5) because, applying the rationale of <i>Belton, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133480/belton-v-bowers-ambulance-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133480/belton-v-bowers-ambulance-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(Code Civ. Proa, \u00a7 352.) The trial court rejected the analysis in <i>Bennett, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2300663\"><a href=\"/opinion/2300663/bennett-v-shahhal/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, relating to the interplay between Code of Civil Procedure sections 340.5 and 352. The trial court further held that summary adjudication could not be granted to part of plaintiffs case because it would not completely dispose of a cause of action, affirmative defense, claim for damages, or an issue of duty. (Code Civ. Proa, \u00a7 437c, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p>Alcott petitioned this court seeking a writ of mandate. Alcott requested that we order the trial court to eliminate all of plaintiffs claims derived from Alcott's conduct occurring on or before January 12, 1999.</p>\n<p>We issued an order to show cause and set the matter for hearing. Plaintiff filed a return, and Alcott filed a reply. Having reviewed the pleadings and having heard oral argument, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The insanity tolling provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 352 is applicable to the one-year statute of limitations provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5.</i></h2>\n<p>Alcott contends the trial court erred in concluding that, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 352, plaintiffs \"insanity\" tolled the one-year limitation provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5. This contention is unpersuasive. a. <i>Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 is the statute of limitations applicable to actions against health care providers. It was enacted as part of the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MCRA). (<i>Belton, supra,</i> 20 Cal.4th at p. 930, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133480/belton-v-bowers-ambulance-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed three years unless tolled for any of the following: (1) upon proof of fraud, (2) intentional concealment, or (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of the injured person. Actions by a minor shall be commenced within three years from the date of the alleged wrongful act except that actions by a minor under the full age of six years shall be commenced within three years or prior to his eighth birthday whichever provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for minors for any period during which parent or guardian and defendant's insurer or health care provider have committed fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured minor for professional negligence.\"</p>\n<p>Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 defines a \"health care provider,\" for its purposes to include, among others, \"any clinic, health dispensary, or health facility, licensed pursuant to Division 2 (commencing with Section 1200) of the Health and Safety Code.\" Health and Safety Code section 1250, subdivision (c) defines a \"skilled nursing facility\" health facility that provides skilled nursing care and supportive care to patients whose primary need is for availability of skilled nursing care on an extended basis.\"</p>\n<p>Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 also defines \"professional negligence\" for its purposes as \"a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services, which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death, provided that such services are within the scope of services for which the provider is licensed and which are not within any restriction imposed by the licensing agency or licensed hospital.\"</p>\n<p>The premise of Alcott's summary adjudication motion was that certain factual matters could be eliminated as they were outside the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5. Plaintiff did <i>not</i> suggest in her opposition to the summary adjudication motion that Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 did <i>not</i> apply. Plaintiff did <i>not</i> contend that for purposes of the statute of limitations her cause of action labeled \"elder abuse and neglect\" brought pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 15600 et seq., or portions of that cause of action, should be treated differently than her cause of action for medical malpractice. Rather, plaintiff argued that the one-year limitation period in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 was tolled pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 352. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, we assume that Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 applied to all of plaintiffs claims.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*812</span> We first note that the three-year limitation period in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 is a maximum. Plaintiff was first admitted to Alcott in November 1998. The case was filed in March 6, 2000. Thus, the three-year maximum limitation period contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 is not an issue. The question raised by Alcott is whether the insanity tolling provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 352 applies to the one-year limitation provision of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Code of Civil Procedure section 352 and </i><i>Belton, supra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133480/belton-v-bowers-ambulance-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span></i><i>.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Code of Civil Procedure section 352 is a toiling provision.

The proper interpretation of the language in the second sentence of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 and the only reasonable application of the rationale of <i>Belton,</i> compels tolling of the one-year limitation period under Code of Civil Procedure section 352 when a plaintiff is insane.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Fogarty v.

It leads to the conclusion that the one-year statute of limitations contained in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 can be tolled by the insanity provision in Code of Civil Procedure section 352. Any language in <i>Bennett, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2300663\"><a href=\"/opinion/2300663/bennett-v-shahhal/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Thus, the trial court has not erred in concluding the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5 has been tolled by plaintiffs insanity.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*816</span> DISPOSITION</h2>\n<p>The petition for writ of mandate is denied. The order to show cause issued March 12, 2001, is discharged. Alcott is to bear costs in this proceeding.</p>\n<p>We concur: KLEIN, P.J., CROSKEY, J.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  In that the matter comes to us upon the denial of a motion for summary adjudication, we construe the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the party opposing the motion. (<i>Mariani v. Price Waterhouse</i> (1999) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258572\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258572/mariani-v-waterhouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Rptr. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>.)</p>\n<p>[2]  All subsequent legal actions were taken by Clark, on behalf of plaintiff. For ease of reference, and unless otherwise significant, we simply refer to plaintiff.</p>\n<p>[3]  Westside Health Care Nursing Home Hospital, who also was named as a defendant, has settled the case against it.</p>\n<p>[4]  Amicus Curiae California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, Inc. argues that portions of plaintiff's first cause of action for elder abuse and neglect (Welf. &amp; Inst.Code, \u00a7 15600) are not controlled by the statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5. This issue was <i>not</i> addressed by plaintiff below or in this writ proceeding. Further, in the summary adjudication pleadings, the parties did not raise in their respective, separate statements of undisputed facts any facts relating to the applicability of Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5. Thus, we have not addressed the issue raised by amicus curiae. We leave for another day the issue of whether or not allegations of elder abuse and neglect brought pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 15600 et seq. are within the confines of the statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340.5.</p>\n<p>[5]  Code of Civil Procedure section 352.1, subdivision (a) provides in relevant part: \"If a person entitled to bring an action ... is, at the time the cause of action accrued, imprisoned on a criminal charge, or in execution under the sentence of a criminal court for a term less than for life, the time of that disability is not a part of the time limited for the commencement of the action, not to exceed two years.\"</p>\n<p>[6]  Code of Civil Procedure section 352 also includes a tolling provision for minors. Our holding does not address this portion of section 352. (<i>Steketee v. Lintz, Williams &amp; Rothberg</i> (1985) <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421531\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421531/steketee-v-lintz-williams-rothberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 54, fn. 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421531\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421531/steketee-v-lintz-williams-rothberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

By 1994 amendment, that portion of Code of Civil Procedure section 352 was deleted and codified in Code of Civil Procedure section 352.1, the statute addressed in <i>Belton, supra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133480/belton-v-bowers-ambulance-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1133480\"><a href=\"/opinion/1133480/belton-v-bowers-ambulance-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.
