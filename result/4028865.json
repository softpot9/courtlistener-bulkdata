Analysis\n\n     Dell\u2019s primary argument is that Mr. Hughes\u2019 deposition\n\nshould be postponed until CTS\u2019s Motion to Add Dell is ruled on\n\nby the S.D.N.Y. so that Dell \u201cwill not face the prospect of Mr.\n\nHughes potentially being called to testify both as a non-party\n\nand again later as a party witness.\u201d Dell Mem. Supp. at 5. CTS\n\ncontends that if the Court grants Dell\u2019s Motion on this basis,\n\nit will \u201cbe prejudiced if it is denied this deposition and the\n\n\n\n                                4\n\fNew York court denies its application to implead Dell, leaving\n\nCTS without this required deposition.\u201d Def.\u2019s Mem. Opp. at 7.\n\n     CTS\u2019s argument is not persuasive. Issuance of a protective\n\norder preventing Mr. Hughes\u2019 deposition until CTS\u2019s interpleader\n\nmotion is ruled on in the New York matter will both eliminate\n\nthe risk that Mr. Hughes will be deposed twice (once as a non-\n\nparty and once as a party), while preserving CTS\u2019s ability to\n\ndepose Mr. Hughes as a non-party if CTS\u2019s motion to interplead\n\nDell is denied. Notably, the only case with similar facts, as\n\ncited by Dell, reasoned that:\n\n          Given that [the deponent]\u2019s status as either\n          a percipient witness or a named defendant\n          awaits   the  district   judge\u2019s  ruling  on\n          Plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to amend, the\n          Court is persuaded that a protective order\n          postponing [the deponent]\u2019s deposition is\n          appropriate. [The deponent] is entitled to\n          answer questions when he knows whether he is\n          a defendant in this case.\n\nDoe v. City of San Diego, Civ. No. 12-0689, 2013 WL 3989193, at\n\n*7 (S.D. Ca. Aug. 1, 2013). CTS cites no contrary authority. 1\n\nDell has demonstrated good cause for issuance of a protective\n\norder postponing Mr. Hughes deposition until the S.D.N.Y rules\n\non CTS\u2019s Motion for Interpleader pending in the underlying\n\naction. As in Doe, these specific facts demonstrate an undue\n\n\n1 Arguments by Dell and CTS relating to whether Mr. Hughes\u2019\ndeposition is duplicative or necessary are superfluous until\nCTS\u2019s Motion to Interplead Dell is resolved in the New York\nmatter.\n                                5\n\fburden on Dell that can be avoided by the least burdensome\n\nremedy of a protective order postponing Mr. Hughes\u2019 deposition\n\nrather than quashing the subpoena at issue.\n\n     IV.   Conclusion\n\n     For the reasons discussed above, Dell\u2019s Motion to Quash, or\n\nin the alternative, for a Protective Order is GRANTED in part\n\nand DENIED in part. To the extent Dell seeks to Quash Mr.\n\nHughes\u2019 subpoena, the Motion is DENIED; to the extent Dell seeks\n\na Protective Order postponing Mr. Hughes\u2019 deposition until CTS\u2019s\n\nMotion to Interplead Dell is ruled on is GRANTED.
