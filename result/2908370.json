Nor was any request made for a separate proceeding\r\nto determine the issue.  Instead, Appellant claims on appeal for the first time that the court should\r\nhave <i>sua sponte</i> halted the proceeding and conducted a competency hearing.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>The record reflects that the trial judge asked Appellant, \u201cAre you mentally competent and able\r\nto effectively assist your attorney in the case and able to have a rational as well as a factual\r\nunderstanding of the charge and proceedings against you?\u201d, to which Appellant answered, \u201cYes\r\nsir.\u201d  The court then asked Appellant\u2019s attorney, \u201cAnd there is no question in your mind about that,\r\nis there counsel?\u201d, to which Appellant\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cThere is some question about Mr.\r\nJohnson\u2019s mental state but in terms of him understanding what\u2019s going on and him understanding\r\nthe nature of the charges against him and what we\u2019ve done, I believe he\u2019s competent to understand\r\nall that.\u201d  The court then asked counsel, \u201cYou\u2019re satisfied he\u2019s competent?\u201d, to which counsel\r\nreplied, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>There was evidence that Appellant had depression and problems with his thinking for several\r\nyears; that he had been abused by his stepfather, and became depressed as a result.  Dr. Mitchell,\r\na psychologist, testified Appellant suffered from schizophrenia for four or five years which had a\r\nbig impact on his behavior; that the schizophrenia was getting worse; that Appellant is a danger to\r\nhimself and others and she recommended Appellant receive very thorough psychiatric care.  She\r\nfurther testified that, in her opinion, he was competent to stand trial; understood the charges against\r\nhim; and was able to work with his attorney in forming a defense.  There is evidence Appellant\r\nattempted to kill himself twice before cutting himself on the night he slashed Ms. Pickering with\r\nhis knife.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>A no time during trial did Appellant suggest that he was incompetent and could not consult\r\nwith his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rationality, or that he did not have a factual\r\nunderstanding of the proceedings against him.  His testimony was intelligent and straight forward\r\nand he gave thoughtful responses to the questions of his attorney and the prosecutor.

Appellant\u2019s attorney did not complain of any inability to\r\ncommunicate with Appellant and there is no indication in the record that Appellant\u2019s appearance\r\nor demeanor during trial was out of the ordinary.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Assuming, without deciding, that Appellant has preserved his point of error, there is no\r\nevidence that the trial judge abused his discretion in failing to impanel a jury to determine\r\nAppellant\u2019s competency to stand trial.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Point 1 is overruled.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Point 2: \u201cThe evidence is factually insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s assessment of 50\r\nyears in the Texas Department of Corrections.\u201d</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</span>Specifically, Appellant asserts that the factual sufficiency standard of review of <i>Clewis v.
