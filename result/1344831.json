The party moving for summary judgment must show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that, as a result, the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Watts. v. Cumberland County Hosp. System,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1324791\"><a href=\"/opinion/1324791/watts-v-cumberland-county-hosp-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span> (1986). Review of summary judgment on appeal is limited to whether the trial court's conclusions are correct as to the questions of whether there is a genuine issue of material fact and whether the movant is entitled to judgment. <i>Ellis v. Williams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1238802\"><a href=\"/opinion/1238802/ellis-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1238802\"><a href=\"/opinion/1238802/ellis-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span> (1987).</p>\n<p>In the present case, we must find the trial court's conclusions were correct as to summary judgment on the wrongful discharge claim. By her own testimony in her deposition, plaintiff admits that she was at no time discharged. She testified that her supervisor, the district manager, told her on 31 May 1984 that she would no longer be the manager of store # 331 located in Sanford. He told her she would be put on a week's vacation and transferred to another store. She further admits in all later conversations with corporate officials she was told she would be transferred to a store in another district. Plaintiff was contacted by her zone manager, Eddie Garmon, several times and asked if she would be willing to transfer to another store in Sanford. Each time, plaintiff answered that she would only return to her original store. After approximately one month, Garmon called plaintiff to discuss a leave of absence. Plaintiff testified that she stated, \"Eddie, I have nothing more to say to you,\" and plaintiff terminated the conversation. Thereafter, plaintiff received a registered letter from Garmon which stated that plaintiff should give him notice of her decision whether or not to transfer by 9 July 1984. Plaintiff responded to the letter through her attorney, notifying defendant that she wanted to return to her original store.</p>\n<p>We hold there is no genuine issue of material fact presented by plaintiff. Plaintiff has brought forth no evidence of a discharge by defendant, wrongful or otherwise. Therefore, defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Summary judgment for defendant on the claim of wrongful discharge is affirmed.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff next argues the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment on her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiff asserts that there are substantial issues of fact raised by the evidence presented to the trial court.</p>\n<p>The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress was first recognized by our Supreme Court in <i>Stanback v. Stanback,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1332001\"><a href=\"/opinion/1332001/stanback-v-stanback/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span> (1979). There <span class=\"star-pagination\">*580</span> the Court stated that liability arises under this tort when a defendant's \"conduct exceeds all bounds usually tolerated by decent society\" and, the conduct \"causes mental distress of a very serious kind.\" <i>Id.</i> at 196, 254 S.E.2d at 622, <i>quoting Prosser, The Law of Torts</i> Sec. 12, p. 56 (4th ed. 1971).

We hold that no construction of the forecast of evidence gives rise to an issue as to whether defendant's conduct was intended to inflict emotional distress or was done with reckless indifference to the likelihood that emotional distress may result. Summary judgment for defendant on this claim, like the other, is affirmed.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<p>WELLS and EAGLES, JJ., concur.</p>\n</div>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
