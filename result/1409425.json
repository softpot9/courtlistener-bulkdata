Ramsay, McClure, Ramsay &amp; Dickerson, Toccoa, for Brevard Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n.</p>\n<p>Ronald G. Robey, Smith, Currie &amp; Hancock, Atlanta, for Ford Mountain Investments.</p>\n<p>HUNT, Justice.</p>\n<p>The trial court granted Ford Mountain Investments an injunction forbidding Brevard Federal Savings and Loan Association from commencing foreclosure and ruled in favor of Ford on their contract dispute. Brevard appeals.</p>\n<p>Brevard loaned money to Wiggins to develop two parcels of real property in Rabun County known as Heatherstone Lakes Subdivision and Highland Tops I. When Wiggins experienced financial problems, Ford agreed with Brevard to take over both projects and continue development of the property. Ford is subordinated in interest to the note and deed to secure debt and has made payments of over $600,000 to Brevard, although Ford is not itself liable on the original note. Thus, Brevard's only remedy against Ford for failing to continue to make payments is foreclosure.</p>\n<p>The agreement between Ford and Brevard also provides Ford may sell \"any lot of a size and acreage customarily developed as a residential lot upon payment of a release fee of <i>30% of the appraised value</i> of the property sought to be released.\" [Emphasis supplied.] By their practice in the past, Ford had obtained releases by paying 30% of the <i>retail</i> appraisal value, upon which their agreement had been negotiated.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>On September 27, 1990, Ford sought to obtain a release on the entire forty-one acre Highland Tops tract by tendering 30% of the sum of the <i>wholesale</i> appraisal prices of Highland Tops' thirty-four lots. Brevard refused, demanding 30% of the current fair market value for the release.</p>\n<p>Ford filed a declaratory judgment action to clarify this contract issue and sought to enjoin Brevard from taking any action to foreclose. By agreement, an injunction was entered to maintain the status quo pending a hearing. When Ford failed to make the next monthly payment, Brevard moved for a hearing to dissolve the injunction.<sup>[2]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> The trial court, after the hearing, denied the motion to dissolve and continued the injunction. Brevard appealed. Thereafter, the trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law not only on the injunction, but also on the merits of the declaratory judgment action, holding the contract between the parties required Brevard to release its interest in Highland Tops based on the wholesale appraisal value of the lots. Brevard filed an amended notice of appeal.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>1. Brevard, which has consistently demanded a jury trial on the merits of the underlying contract controversy, contends the trial court erred in ruling on the merits, without its consent, after the hearing on the injunction. While OCGA \u00a7 9-11-65(a)(2) allows for consolidation of the hearing on an interlocutory injunction and on the merits by prior order, this subsection includes a proviso that \"[t]his paragraph shall be construed and applied so as to save any rights of the parties which they may have to trial by jury.\" Compare OCGA \u00a7 9-11-52.</p>\n<p>The trial court did not enter an order consolidating the hearing on the injunction and on the merits, and is not permitted to consolidate the hearing on the injunction with the hearing on the merits over the objection of one of the parties.<sup>[4]</sup><i>Gwinnett County v.

Thus, the trial court's judgment on the merits must be vacated.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>2. Brevard argues the trial court erred in enjoining it from proceeding to foreclose on the property. The trial court acted on the erroneous assumption that the failure to release the property excused Ford from continuing to make these payments. As was said in <i>Wright v. Intercounty Properties, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1343201\"><a href=\"/opinion/1343201/wright-v-intercounty-properties/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 494, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1343201\"><a href=\"/opinion/1343201/wright-v-intercounty-properties/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span> (1977):</p>\n<blockquote>this court has held that \"a borrower who has executed a deed to secure debt is not entitled to an injunction against a sale of the property under a power in the deed, unless he first pays or tenders to the creditor the amount admittedly due.\" <i>Oliver v.
