Husband appealed and served a copy of the notice\nof appeal on his wife, but he did not serve a copy of the notice of appeal on his\nwife\u2019s attorney, as ORCP 9\u00a0B requires. The Court of Appeals dismissed husband\u2019s\nappeal for lack of jurisdiction. Held: Compliance with the manner of service spec-\nified in ORCP 9 B is mandatory requirement of appellate jurisdiction. Husband\u2019s\nfailure to timely serve a copy of the notice of appeal on wife\u2019s attorney, as ORCP 9\nB requires, deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction.\n                     The order of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n______________\n\t   *\u2002 Order of Dismissal issued by the Appellate Commissioner on July 15, 2013;\norder denying reconsideration of order of dismissal issued by the Chief Judge on\nAugust 6, 2013.\n\f754\t                                                   J. A. H. v. Heikkila\n\n\t          KISTLER, J.\n\t        ORCP 9\u00a0B requires a party filing a notice of appeal\nto serve a copy of the notice on a represented party\u2019s attor-\nney. The question that this case presents is whether an\nappellant\u2019s failure to comply with that requirement is a\njurisdictional defect. The Court of Appeals held that it is\nand dismissed this appeal. We allowed review to consider\nthat issue and now affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 order dis-\nmissing the appeal.\n\t        Before turning to the facts of this case, it is helpful\nto describe briefly the governing statutes. To confer juris-\ndiction on the Court of Appeals, an appellant must file the\nnotice of appeal and serve it on the other parties to the action\nwithin 30 days after the judgment is entered in the register.\nSee ORS 19.270(1) (providing that timely filing and service\nof the notice of appeal are jurisdictional); ORS 19.255 (spec-\nifying that an appellant must file and serve the notice of\nappeal within 30 days). Although ORS 19.270 provides that\ntimely service of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, it does\nnot specify how the notice of appeal must be served. On that\nissue, ORS 19.500 provides:\n    \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, when any\n    provision of this chapter requires that a document be\n    served and filed, the document shall be served in the man-\n    ner provided in ORCP 9\u00a0B.\u201d\nORCP 9\u00a0B, in turn, provides that, when a party is repre-\nsented by an attorney, \u201cservice shall be made upon the attor-\nney unless otherwise ordered by the court.\u201d1\n\t        In this case, the trial court granted wife\u2019s petition\nfor a restraining order against husband and entered that\norder in the trial court register on May 9, 2013. On June 10,\n\t1\n     \u2002 ORCP 9\u00a0B provides, in part:\n    \u201cWhenever under these rules service is required or permitted to be made\n    upon a party, and that party is represented by an attorney, the service shall\n    be made upon the attorney unless otherwise ordered by the court. Service\n    upon the attorney or upon a party shall be made by delivering a copy to\n    such attorney or party, by mailing it to such attorney\u2019s or party\u2019s last known\n    address or, if the party is represented by an attorney, by telephonic facsimile\n    communication device or e-mail as provided in sections F or G of this rule.\n    *\u2009*\u2009* Service by mail is complete upon mailing.\u201d\n\fCite as 355 Or 753 (2014)\t755\n\n2013, husband\u2019s attorney filed a notice of appeal and served\na copy of that notice by mailing it to wife.2 Husband\u2019s attor-\nney did not serve a copy of the notice on wife\u2019s attorney, even\nthough ORCP 9\u00a0B required him to do so and even though\nwife has been represented by the same attorney throughout\nthis litigation. Eight days later, the Court of Appeals sent a\n\u201cdeficiency notice\u201d to husband stating that the case caption\nin the notice of appeal was incorrect. The Court of Appeals\nsent a copy of the deficiency notice to wife, who emailed a\npicture of it to her attorney.\n\t        Shortly after wife\u2019s attorney learned that husband\nhad filed a notice of appeal, wife moved to dismiss husband\u2019s\nappeal because the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction. Wife\nnoted that husband had not served her attorney with a copy\nof the notice of appeal, as ORCP 9\u00a0B requires. Relying on\nMcCall v. Kulongoski, 339 Or 186, 118 P3d 256 (2005), wife\nreasoned that ORCP 9\u00a0B defines the manner of service that,\nunder ORS 19.270, is a necessary prerequisite for appellate\njurisdiction. It followed, wife concluded, that husband\u2019s fail-\nure to serve the notice of appeal on her attorney in compli-\nance with ORCP 9\u00a0B deprived the Court of Appeals of juris-\ndiction. The Appellate Commissioner agreed and dismissed\nhusband\u2019s appeal. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals\ndenied husband\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and we allowed\nhusband\u2019s petition for review to consider whether his failure\nto comply with ORCP\u00a09\u00a0B is a jurisdictional defect.3\n\t        On review, husband notes that the plain text of the\njurisdictional statutes requires that an appellant serve a\ncopy of the notice of appeal on the other \u201cparties\u201d to the case.\nSee ORS 19.270(2); ORS 19.240. In husband\u2019s view, those\nstatutes define what a party must do to confer jurisdiction\non the Court of Appeals, and he complied with them. He\ntimely served the only other \u201cparty\u201d to the action\u2014namely,\nhis wife\u2014with a copy of the notice of appeal. Husband does\nnot dispute that he failed to comply with ORCP 9\u00a0B when\nhe failed to serve wife\u2019s attorney. He reasons, however, that\n\t2\n     \u2002 The 30th day following entry of the trial court\u2019s order granting the restrain-\ning order fell on a Saturday. Husband timely filed his notice of appeal the next\nbusiness day. See ORS 174.120(3).\n\t3\n     \u2002 The lawyer who currently represents husband on review is not the lawyer\nwho filed and served the notice of appeal.\n\f756\t                                     J. A. H. v. Heikkila\n\nthat error is not jurisdictional and that statements to the\ncontrary in McCall were unnecessary to decide that case.\n\t        In considering husband\u2019s argument, we start with\nthe text of ORS 19.270. ORS 19.270(1) provides that \u201cthe\nCourt of Appeals has jurisdiction of the cause when the\nnotice of appeal has been served and filed as provided in ORS\n19.240, 19.250 and 19.255.\u201d ORS 19.270(2) specifies that the\n\u201cfollowing requirements of ORS 19.240, 19.250 and 19.255\nare jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended.\u201d One\nof those requirements is that the notice of appeal be \u201cserved\u201d\non either the \u201cadverse parties\u201d identified in the notice of\nappeal or, if the notice does not identify which parties are\nadverse, \u201call parties who have appeared in the action.\u201d ORS\n19.270(2)(a).\n\t       Husband\u2019s interpretation of the text of ORS 19.270 is\nplausible. Not only does ORS 19.270(2) not specify that com-\npliance with ORS 19.500 and ORCP 9\u00a0B is a jurisdictional\nprerequisite, but it requires only that the notice of appeal\nbe served on the \u201cparties\u201d to the action. ORS 19.270(2) does\nnot require that the notice of appeal be served on the party\u2019s\nattorney as a prerequisite to obtaining jurisdiction.\n\t        Another interpretation is also permissible, however.\nAs this court recognized in McCall, ORS 19.270 requires\nthat the notice of appeal be timely served on either those\nadverse parties identified in the notice of appeal or all the\nparties who have appeared in the action. See 339 Or at 194.\nAlthough ORS 19.270 makes clear that timely service is\njurisdictional, it does not specify how timely service must be\naccomplished to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals.\nORS 19.500 fills that gap. It provides that, when ORS chap-\nter 19 requires that a document be served and filed, \u201cthe\ndocument shall be served in the manner provided in ORCP\n9\u00a0B.\u201d\n\t       We have consistently interpreted ORS 19.270 in\ncontext; that is, we have consistently read ORS 19.270 and\nORS 19.500 together to determine who must be served and\nhow service must be accomplished for the Court of Appeals\nto acquire jurisdiction. In McCall, for example, this court\nheld that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over the\ndefendant\u2019s appeal because the defendant had not served the\n\fCite as 355 Or 753 (2014)\t757\n\nplaintiffs by mailing the notice of appeal to \u201cthe last known\naddress of [the] plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers,\u201d as ORCP 9\u00a0B required.\nMcCall, 339 Or at 195. In reaching that conclusion, the court\nexplained that ORS 19.270, ORS 19.240, and ORS 19.500\n\u201cillustrate that the legislature intended to premise appel-\nlate jurisdiction under ORS chapter 19 on proper service of\nnotice\u201d and that ORS 19.500 specifies that the proper man-\nner of service is that set out in OCRP 9\u00a0B.4 Id.\n\t        This court returned to the issue one year later in\nGadda v. Gadda, 341 Or 1, 136 P3d 1099 (2006). In that\ncase, the court held that the Court of Appeals had jurisdic-\ntion over the husband\u2019s appeal because the husband had\ncaused the notice of appeal to be delivered to the wife\u2019s attor-\nney, in accordance with ORCP 9\u00a0B. That holding rests on\nthe proposition that compliance (or noncompliance) with the\nservice requirements in ORCP 9\u00a0B is jurisdictional.\n\t        Most recently, in Ann Sacks Tile and Stone, Inc. v.\nDept. of Rev., 352 Or 380, 390, 287 P3d 1062 (2012), this\ncourt held that a party\u2019s failure to serve a notice of appeal\nconsistently with ORCP 9\u00a0B deprived the Court of Appeals\nof jurisdiction. In so holding, the court specifically consid-\nered the issue that husband raises here. The court noted:\n    \u201cAlthough ORS 19.270(2)(a) specifically makes the timeli-\n    ness of service jurisdictional, that statute does not cross\n    reference either ORS 19.260 or ORS 19.500, which govern\n    the manner of service. Therefore, the possibility exists that\n    the manner of service is not jurisdictional.\u201d\nId. at 386 (emphasis omitted). Addressing that possibility,\nthis court rejected it. The court explained that \u201c[t]his court\u2019s\nprior case law *\u2009 * leaves no doubt that appellate jurisdic-\n                  *\u2009\ntion requires service of a notice of appeal in a particular\nmanner.\u201d Id. The court reasoned that, under cases such as\nMcCall and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. City of Central Point,\n341 Or 393, 144 P3d 914 (2006), the timeliness of service\n\t4\n     \u2002Husband argues that McCall is distinguishable because the defendant\nin that case served the plaintiff by mailing the notice of appeal to the wrong\naddress. The requirement, however, that the defendant in that case serve the\nnotice of appeal by mailing it to \u201cthe last known address of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u201d\ncame from ORCP 9\u00a0B. It was the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with that aspect of\nORCP 9\u00a0B that led this court in McCall to hold that the Court of Appeals lacked\njurisdiction. See 339 Or at 195-96.\n\f758\t                                     J. A. H. v. Heikkila\n\nand the manner of service are inextricably intertwined. Ann\nSacks, 352 Or at 387. For a document to be timely served,\nservice must comply with ORCP 9\u00a0B. Id. at 387, 390.\n\t        Those cases control this one. ORCP 9\u00a0B specifies\nhow an appellant must serve a party when that party is rep-\nresented. The appellant must serve the party\u2019s attorney. In\nthis case, husband did not do so in a timely manner, and\nthat failure deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction.\nFor us to hold otherwise, we would have to overrule our deci-\nsions in McCall, Gadda, and Ann Sacks. Husband, however,\nhas presented no basis for our doing so. See Farmers Ins. Co.\nv. Mowry, 350 Or 686, 698, 261 P3d 1 (2011) (explaining the\nbases for overruling precedents). We accordingly adhere to\nour decisions in McCall, Gadda, and Ann Sacks. Under those\ndecisions, husband\u2019s failure to serve the notice of appeal in\ncompliance with ORCP 9\u00a0B deprived the Court of Appeals of\njurisdiction.\n\t       The order of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">No. 48\t                                        August 7, 2014\t753\n48A.Or v.

Husband\u2019s\nfailure to timely serve a copy of the notice of appeal on wife\u2019s attorney, as ORCP 9\nB requires, deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction.\n                     The order of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n______________\n\t   *\u2002 Order of Dismissal issued by the Appellate Commissioner on July 15, 2013;\norder denying reconsideration of order of dismissal issued by the Chief Judge on\nAugust 6, 2013.\n\f754\t                                                   J. A. H. v. Heikkila\n\n\t          KISTLER, J.\n\t        ORCP 9\u00a0B requires a party filing a notice of appeal\nto serve a copy of the notice on a represented party\u2019s attor-\nney. The question that this case presents is whether an\nappellant\u2019s failure to comply with that requirement is a\njurisdictional defect. The Court of Appeals held that it is\nand dismissed this appeal. We allowed review to consider\nthat issue and now affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 order dis-\nmissing the appeal.\n\t        Before turning to the facts of this case, it is helpful\nto describe briefly the governing statutes. To confer juris-\ndiction on the Court of Appeals, an appellant must file the\nnotice of appeal and serve it on the other parties to the action\nwithin 30 days after the judgment is entered in the register.\nSee ORS 19.270(1) (providing that timely filing and service\nof the notice of appeal are jurisdictional); ORS 19.255 (spec-\nifying that an appellant must file and serve the notice of\nappeal within 30 days). Although ORS 19.270 provides that\ntimely service of the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, it does\nnot specify how the notice of appeal must be served. On that\nissue, ORS 19.500 provides:\n    \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, when any\n    provision of this chapter requires that a document be\n    served and filed, the document shall be served in the man-\n    ner provided in ORCP 9\u00a0B.\u201d\nORCP 9\u00a0B, in turn, provides that, when a party is repre-\nsented by an attorney, \u201cservice shall be made upon the attor-\nney unless otherwise ordered by the court.\u201d1\n\t        In this case, the trial court granted wife\u2019s petition\nfor a restraining order against husband and entered that\norder in the trial court register on May 9, 2013. On June 10,\n\t1\n     \u2002 ORCP 9\u00a0B provides, in part:\n    \u201cWhenever under these rules service is required or permitted to be made\n    upon a party, and that party is represented by an attorney, the service shall\n    be made upon the attorney unless otherwise ordered by the court. Service\n    upon the attorney or upon a party shall be made by delivering a copy to\n    such attorney or party, by mailing it to such attorney\u2019s or party\u2019s last known\n    address or, if the party is represented by an attorney, by telephonic facsimile\n    communication device or e-mail as provided in sections F or G of this rule.\n    *\u2009*\u2009* Service by mail is complete upon mailing.\u201d\n\fCite as 355 Or 753 (2014)\t755\n\n2013, husband\u2019s attorney filed a notice of appeal and served\na copy of that notice by mailing it to wife.2 Husband\u2019s attor-\nney did not serve a copy of the notice on wife\u2019s attorney, even\nthough ORCP 9\u00a0B required him to do so and even though\nwife has been represented by the same attorney throughout\nthis litigation. Eight days later, the Court of Appeals sent a\n\u201cdeficiency notice\u201d to husband stating that the case caption\nin the notice of appeal was incorrect. The Court of Appeals\nsent a copy of the deficiency notice to wife, who emailed a\npicture of it to her attorney.\n\t        Shortly after wife\u2019s attorney learned that husband\nhad filed a notice of appeal, wife moved to dismiss husband\u2019s\nappeal because the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction. Wife\nnoted that husband had not served her attorney with a copy\nof the notice of appeal, as ORCP 9\u00a0B requires. Relying on\nMcCall v. Kulongoski, 339 Or 186, 118 P3d 256 (2005), wife\nreasoned that ORCP 9\u00a0B defines the manner of service that,\nunder ORS 19.270, is a necessary prerequisite for appellate\njurisdiction. It followed, wife concluded, that husband\u2019s fail-\nure to serve the notice of appeal on her attorney in compli-\nance with ORCP 9\u00a0B deprived the Court of Appeals of juris-\ndiction. The Appellate Commissioner agreed and dismissed\nhusband\u2019s appeal. The Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals\ndenied husband\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and we allowed\nhusband\u2019s petition for review to consider whether his failure\nto comply with ORCP\u00a09\u00a0B is a jurisdictional defect.3\n\t        On review, husband notes that the plain text of the\njurisdictional statutes requires that an appellant serve a\ncopy of the notice of appeal on the other \u201cparties\u201d to the case.\nSee ORS 19.270(2); ORS 19.240. In husband\u2019s view, those\nstatutes define what a party must do to confer jurisdiction\non the Court of Appeals, and he complied with them. He\ntimely served the only other \u201cparty\u201d to the action\u2014namely,\nhis wife\u2014with a copy of the notice of appeal. Husband does\nnot dispute that he failed to comply with ORCP 9\u00a0B when\nhe failed to serve wife\u2019s attorney. He reasons, however, that\n\t2\n     \u2002 The 30th day following entry of the trial court\u2019s order granting the restrain-\ning order fell on a Saturday. Husband timely filed his notice of appeal the next\nbusiness day. See ORS 174.120(3).\n\t3\n     \u2002 The lawyer who currently represents husband on review is not the lawyer\nwho filed and served the notice of appeal.\n\f756\t                                     J. A. H. v. Heikkila\n\nthat error is not jurisdictional and that statements to the\ncontrary in McCall were unnecessary to decide that case.\n\t        In considering husband\u2019s argument, we start with\nthe text of ORS 19.270. ORS 19.270(1) provides that \u201cthe\nCourt of Appeals has jurisdiction of the cause when the\nnotice of appeal has been served and filed as provided in ORS\n19.240, 19.250 and 19.255.\u201d ORS 19.270(2) specifies that the\n\u201cfollowing requirements of ORS 19.240, 19.250 and 19.255\nare jurisdictional and may not be waived or extended.\u201d One\nof those requirements is that the notice of appeal be \u201cserved\u201d\non either the \u201cadverse parties\u201d identified in the notice of\nappeal or, if the notice does not identify which parties are\nadverse, \u201call parties who have appeared in the action.\u201d ORS\n19.270(2)(a).\n\t       Husband\u2019s interpretation of the text of ORS 19.270 is\nplausible. Not only does ORS 19.270(2) not specify that com-\npliance with ORS 19.500 and ORCP 9\u00a0B is a jurisdictional\nprerequisite, but it requires only that the notice of appeal\nbe served on the \u201cparties\u201d to the action. ORS 19.270(2) does\nnot require that the notice of appeal be served on the party\u2019s\nattorney as a prerequisite to obtaining jurisdiction.\n\t        Another interpretation is also permissible, however.\nAs this court recognized in McCall, ORS 19.270 requires\nthat the notice of appeal be timely served on either those\nadverse parties identified in the notice of appeal or all the\nparties who have appeared in the action. See 339 Or at 194.\nAlthough ORS 19.270 makes clear that timely service is\njurisdictional, it does not specify how timely service must be\naccomplished to confer jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals.\nORS 19.500 fills that gap. It provides that, when ORS chap-\nter 19 requires that a document be served and filed, \u201cthe\ndocument shall be served in the manner provided in ORCP\n9\u00a0B.\u201d\n\t       We have consistently interpreted ORS 19.270 in\ncontext; that is, we have consistently read ORS 19.270 and\nORS 19.500 together to determine who must be served and\nhow service must be accomplished for the Court of Appeals\nto acquire jurisdiction. In McCall, for example, this court\nheld that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over the\ndefendant\u2019s appeal because the defendant had not served the\n\fCite as 355 Or 753 (2014)\t757\n\nplaintiffs by mailing the notice of appeal to \u201cthe last known\naddress of [the] plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers,\u201d as ORCP 9\u00a0B required.\nMcCall, 339 Or at 195. In reaching that conclusion, the court\nexplained that ORS 19.270, ORS 19.240, and ORS 19.500\n\u201cillustrate that the legislature intended to premise appel-\nlate jurisdiction under ORS chapter 19 on proper service of\nnotice\u201d and that ORS 19.500 specifies that the proper man-\nner of service is that set out in OCRP 9\u00a0B.4 Id.\n\t        This court returned to the issue one year later in\nGadda v. Gadda, 341 Or 1, 136 P3d 1099 (2006). In that\ncase, the court held that the Court of Appeals had jurisdic-\ntion over the husband\u2019s appeal because the husband had\ncaused the notice of appeal to be delivered to the wife\u2019s attor-\nney, in accordance with ORCP 9\u00a0B. That holding rests on\nthe proposition that compliance (or noncompliance) with the\nservice requirements in ORCP 9\u00a0B is jurisdictional.\n\t        Most recently, in Ann Sacks Tile and Stone, Inc. v.\nDept. of Rev., 352 Or 380, 390, 287 P3d 1062 (2012), this\ncourt held that a party\u2019s failure to serve a notice of appeal\nconsistently with ORCP 9\u00a0B deprived the Court of Appeals\nof jurisdiction. In so holding, the court specifically consid-\nered the issue that husband raises here. The court noted:\n    \u201cAlthough ORS 19.270(2)(a) specifically makes the timeli-\n    ness of service jurisdictional, that statute does not cross\n    reference either ORS 19.260 or ORS 19.500, which govern\n    the manner of service. Therefore, the possibility exists that\n    the manner of service is not jurisdictional.\u201d\nId. at 386 (emphasis omitted). Addressing that possibility,\nthis court rejected it. The court explained that \u201c[t]his court\u2019s\nprior case law *\u2009 * leaves no doubt that appellate jurisdic-\n                  *\u2009\ntion requires service of a notice of appeal in a particular\nmanner.\u201d Id. The court reasoned that, under cases such as\nMcCall and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. City of Central Point,\n341 Or 393, 144 P3d 914 (2006), the timeliness of service\n\t4\n     \u2002Husband argues that McCall is distinguishable because the defendant\nin that case served the plaintiff by mailing the notice of appeal to the wrong\naddress. The requirement, however, that the defendant in that case serve the\nnotice of appeal by mailing it to \u201cthe last known address of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers\u201d\ncame from ORCP 9\u00a0B. It was the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with that aspect of\nORCP 9\u00a0B that led this court in McCall to hold that the Court of Appeals lacked\njurisdiction. See 339 Or at 195-96.\n\f758\t                                     J. A. H. v. Heikkila\n\nand the manner of service are inextricably intertwined. Ann\nSacks, 352 Or at 387. For a document to be timely served,\nservice must comply with ORCP 9\u00a0B. Id. at 387, 390.\n\t        Those cases control this one. ORCP 9\u00a0B specifies\nhow an appellant must serve a party when that party is rep-\nresented. The appellant must serve the party\u2019s attorney. In\nthis case, husband did not do so in a timely manner, and\nthat failure deprived the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction.\nFor us to hold otherwise, we would have to overrule our deci-\nsions in McCall, Gadda, and Ann Sacks. Husband, however,\nhas presented no basis for our doing so. See Farmers Ins. Co.\nv. Mowry, 350 Or 686, 698, 261 P3d 1 (2011) (explaining the\nbases for overruling precedents). We accordingly adhere to\nour decisions in McCall, Gadda, and Ann Sacks. Under those\ndecisions, husband\u2019s failure to serve the notice of appeal in\ncompliance with ORCP 9\u00a0B deprived the Court of Appeals of\njurisdiction.\n\t       The order of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
