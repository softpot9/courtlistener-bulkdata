The superior court denied the petition,\nfinding the surgery center defendants had waived any contractual right to arbitrate the\nclaims against them. We affirm.\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       1. The Complaint\n       On September 2, 2011 the Walker plaintiffs filed this action in Los Angeles\nCounty Superior Court, Central District, alleging 52-year-old Walker had died after\nundergoing bariatric surgery on December 23, 2010 and asserting causes of action against\nthe surgery center defendants and several others for medical malpractice, intentional and\nnegligent misrepresentation, negligent referral, negligent hiring and negligent\nsupervision.\n       2. The Surgery Center Defendants\u2019 Active Motion and Discovery Practice\n       On November 18, 2011 Top Surgeons and 1-800-Get-Thin demurred to the\ncomplaint and moved to strike allegations relating to punitive damages. On\nDecember 16, 2011 Beverly Hills Surgery Center appeared and demurred to the two\ncauses of action alleged against it. It also moved to transfer the matter to the superior\ncourt\u2019s Western District (Santa Monica), contending the lawsuit had been improperly\nfiled in the Central District. None of the demurrers or motions mentioned an arbitration\nagreement.\n\n\n1\n      Brown filed the lawsuit both in her individual capacity and as executor of\nWalker\u2019s estate.\n\n                                              2\n\f       Beginning in December 2011 the surgery center defendants served broad ranging\nwritten discovery requests on the Walker plaintiffs, including two sets of form\ninterrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for admissions and multiple requests for\nproduction of documents. The surgery center defendants also responded to the Walker\nplaintiffs\u2019 similarly extensive written discovery requests.\n       In February 2012 the trial court granted Beverly Hills Surgery Center\u2019s motion to\ntransfer the lawsuit to the Western District. On April 9, 2012 the surgery center\ndefendants moved to compel further responses to interrogatories and document requests\nand sought discovery sanctions.\n       The surgery center defendants deposed each of the three Walker plaintiffs for\nseveral days in April 2012. In addition, Beverly Hills Surgery Center jointly noticed\n(along with another defendant who is not a party to the appeal) the deposition of\nCourtney Brown, Walker\u2019s former ward, and agreed to produce Charles Klasky, the\nsurgery center defendants\u2019 managing representative, for his noticed deposition once the\ndepositions of all three Walker plaintiffs had been completed. At no time during this\nactive discovery process did the surgery center defendants disclose the existence of the\narbitration agreements.\n       On June 1, 2012 the court sustained the surgery center defendants\u2019 demurrers to\nmost of the causes of action with leave to amend and denied their motions to strike. On\nJune 5, 2012 the Walker plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint.\n       On June 13, 2012 the surgery center defendants participated in the deposition of\nCourtney Brown. In a letter dated the same day, the surgery center defendants notified\nthe Walker plaintiffs of their intent to petition to compel arbitration in accordance with\nthe arbitration agreements Walker had signed unless the Walker plaintiffs stipulated to\nresolving their action in the arbitral forum. The Walker plaintiffs contested the\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fenforceability of the arbitration provision but agreed to stay additional discovery pending\nresolution of the arbitration controversy.2\n        3. The Petition To Compel Arbitration\n        On June 15, 2012 the surgery center defendants filed their petition to compel\narbitration of the claims against them based on six separate arbitration agreements\nWalker had signed prior to her surgery.3 Neither the petition nor the supporting papers\noffered any explanation for the delay in seeking arbitration.\n        The Walker plaintiffs opposed the petition, arguing (1) the arbitration agreements\nexecuted prior to December 23, 2010, the day of Walker\u2019s bariatric surgery, were\nimproperly authenticated and inadmissible; (2) the agreement to arbitrate signed on\nDecember 23, 2010 was unenforceable because Walker had died within the agreement\u2019s\n30-day rescission period; (3) only Beverly Hills Surgery Center had standing to enforce\nthe agreements; and (4) the surgery center defendants had waived any right to compel\narbitration.\n        In their reply papers the surgery center defendants insisted, among other things,\nthey had not waived their right to compel arbitration. Emphasizing the trial court had\nonly ruled on their demurrers and motions to strike on June 1, 2012, they argued \u201c[t]he\n\n2\n        The surgery center defendants\u2019 motions to compel were taken off calendar at that\ntime.\n3\n        Each of the six agreements provided, \u201cIt is understood that any dispute as to\nmedical malpractice, that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this\ncontract was [sic] unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently or\nincompetently rendered, will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided by\nCalifornia law, and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process except as California law\nprovides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Both parties to this contract, by\nentering into it, are giving up their constitutional right to have any such dispute decided\nin a court of law before a jury, and instead are accepting the use of arbitration. [\u00b6] It is\nthe intention of the parties that this Agreement bind all parties whose claims may arise\nout of or relate to the treatment or services provided . . . . [\u00b6] All claims against the\nhealth care provider, physician, surgeon, and/or any partners, associates, associations,\ncorporations or partnerships, and the employees, agents, independent contractors and/or\nestates of any of them, must be arbitrated, including without limitation, claims for loss of\nconsortium, wrongful death, wrongful life, emotional distress or punitive damages . . . .\u201d\n\n                                              4\n\flengthy [nine-month] gap between the filing of the initial [c]omplaint and [the surgery\ncenter] defendants\u2019 demand to compel arbitration [wa]s due primarily to the inability of\ndefendants to have their [demurrers and motions to strike] heard quickly. This was not in\ncontrol of the [surgery center] defendants.\u201d They did not offer any other explanation for\ntheir delay in seeking arbitration.4\n       After hearing argument and taking the matter under submission, the trial court\ndenied the petition. Assuming without deciding there was a valid arbitration agreement\nenforceable by each of the surgery center defendants and all claims fell within the scope\nof that agreement, the court found the surgery center defendants had waived (forfeited)\ntheir contractual right to arbitrate. In its August 21, 2012 order the court explained:\n\u201cDefendants argue it\u2019s \u2018not their fault\u2019 so much time elapsed, as it was due in large part to\nthe court\u2019s inability to hear the demurrers earlier. This is not the point. The point is that,\nif Defendants wanted to compel arbitration, they should have done that first, not after\nfiling demurrers and motions to strike. The Court finds Defendants waived their right to\nmove to compel arbitration by filing demurrers and motions to strike, propounding and\nresponding to discovery, and failing to file this motion until [June 15, 2012], more than\nsix months after they initially appeared in connection with the case.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n4\n        At the hearing on the petition to compel arbitration, the court expressed doubt\nabout the surgery center defendants\u2019 purported lack of knowledge of the arbitration\nagreements. Counsel for the surgery center defendants explained she, as well as her\npredecessor counsel, had been unaware of the arbitration agreements due to staff turnover\nin the surgery center defendants\u2019 general counsel\u2019s office; and she had acted promptly to\ncompel arbitration once she learned of them. When counsel for the Walker plaintiffs\nappeared to question those representations, the court interjected, making clear it took\ncounsel at her word with regard to her own actions and those of her predecessor counsel,\nbut distinguished between counsel\u2019s ignorance of the arbitration agreements and that of\nher clients.\n\n                                              5\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n       1. Governing Law and Standard of Review\n       California\u2019s strong public policy favors arbitration as a relatively quick and cost-\neffective means to resolve disputes. (Moncharsh v.

Proc., \u00a7 1281.2, subd. (a).)5\n       \u201cIn the arbitration context, \u2018[t]he term \u201cwaiver\u201d [is] used as a shorthand statement\nfor the conclusion that a contractual right to arbitration has been lost.\u2019\u201d (St. Agnes, supra,\n31 Cal.4th at p. 1195, fn. 4; accord, Platt Pacific, Inc. v.

Here, neither party disputes the agreements are governed by California law, not\nthe Federal Arbitration Act.\n\n                                              6\n\foccurred, the trial court is guided by the six relevant factors identified by the Supreme\nCourt in St. Agnes: \u201c(1) [W]hether the party\u2019s actions are inconsistent with the right to\narbitrate; (2) whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the\nparties were well into the preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing\nparty of an intent to arbitrate; (3) whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement\nclose to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay; (4) whether a\ndefendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the\nproceedings; (5) whether important intervening steps [e.g., taking advantage of judicial\ndiscovery procedures not available in arbitration] had taken place; and (6) whether the\ndelay affected, misled or prejudiced the opposing party.\u201d (Id. at p. 1196 [second set of\nbrackets in original; internal quotation marks omitted]; accord, Lewis v.

There must also be prejudice. (Id. at pp. 1203-1204; Hoover v.\nAmerican Income Life Ins. Co.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1193</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1205 [prejudice is critical\nto the analysis of waiver; absent prejudice, there can be no waiver].) Prejudice,\nmoreover, is not established merely by showing the nonmoving party has incurred costs\nand legal expenses in connection with the litigation. (St. Agnes, at p. 1203; Roman v.\nSuperior Court (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2287958\"><a href=\"/opinion/2287958/roman-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Prejudice may arise, however,\nwhen the petitioning party has \u201cunreasonably delayed\u201d in seeking arbitration (St. Agnes,\nat pp. 1203-1204; Burton v. Cruise, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at p. 947) or has substantially\nimpaired an opponent\u2019s ability to obtain the benefits and efficiencies of arbitration.\n(Guess?, Inc. v.

It is only when \u201c\u2018the facts are undisputed and only one\ninference may reasonably be drawn\u2019\u201d that the issue is one of law. (St. Agnes, at p. 1196;\naccord, Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson, supra, 6 Cal.4th at p. 319; Hoover, at p. 1202.)\n       2. The Trial Court\u2019s Finding of Waiver Is Supported by Substantial Evidence and\n          Is Not Erroneous As a Matter of Law\n       In challenging the trial court\u2019s waiver finding, the surgery center defendants focus\ntheir attention on whether \u201cthe litigation machinery ha[d] been substantially invoked\u201d and\nwhether their delay in seeking arbitration prejudiced the Walker plaintiffs. They insist\nthe answer to both questions is indisputably no, emphasizing the instant litigation is still\nin its early stages: No trial date has been set; no responsive pleading to the first amended\ncomplaint has yet been filed; no experts have been designated; and no depositions have\nactually been taken by the Walker plaintiffs. The \u201cminimal discovery\u201d that has taken\nplace\u2014the written discovery propounded and responded to by both sides and the\ncompleted depositions of the three plaintiffs and a plaintiff\u2019s witness\u2014was preliminary in\nnature and would have been available in arbitration as well.6 Absent a showing the delay\n\n\n6\n       Five of the six arbitration agreements state discovery shall be conducted pursuant\nto Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.05, which vests parties to an arbitration\nagreement with the same rights as provided in the statutes governing discovery in a\njudicial forum except that leave of the arbitrator is required before depositions may be\ntaken. As to that limiting requirement, however, the five agreements expressly state\nleave of the arbitrator is not required to take depositions. The December 23, 2010\nagreement is slightly different: It provides \u201c[a]ll laws of California Civil Procedure shall\napply including but not limited to discovery\u201d unless the parties agree to waive such\nrequirements. It thus appears leave of the arbitrator would be required to conduct\ndepositions under this agreement unless the parties waived this requirement.\n\n                                              8\n\fhas caused any actual prejudice, they argue, the evidence in this case is insufficient as a\nmatter of law to sustain the court\u2019s findings of waiver. (See St. Agnes, supra, 31 Cal.4th\nat p. 1203; Roman v. Superior Court, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1479; cf. Burton v.\nCruise, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at pp. 949, 950 [upholding trial court\u2019s finding of waiver\nwhere defendants participated in litigation for 11 months, filed several demurrers and\nmotions to compel discovery, a trial date had been set, discovery taken and experts had\nbeen designated with a jury in mind].)7\n       The surgery center defendants present a solid case for an initial finding of\nnonwaiver. However, as discussed, our review is limited to determining whether the\nevidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the trial court\u2019s finding of waiver.\nConstruing all reasonable inferences in support of the court\u2019s order, as we must, the\nrecord simply does not establish nonwaiver as a matter of law. (See Lewis v. Fletcher\nJones Motor Cars, Inc., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 453 [\u201c[i]t is not enough the trial\ncourt potentially could have reached a different conclusion; rather, we may reverse the\ntrial court\u2019s waiver finding only if the record establishes a lack of waiver as a matter of\nlaw\u201d]; Hoover v. American Income Life Ins. Co., supra, 206 Cal.App.4th at p. 1202\n[same].)\n       The surgery center defendants vigorously attacked the pleadings, filing demurrers\nand motions to strike; deposed each plaintiff; participated in the deposition of a nonparty\nwitness; served and responded to extensive written discovery; and filed motions to\ncompel coupled with requests for discovery sanctions. There can be little question they\nactively litigated in the judicial forum in a manner wholly inconsistent with any intent to\narbitrate.\n\n\n7\n       The surgery center defendants also argue that not all named defendants have\nappeared in the action. However, they fail to specify which nonappearing defendant will\neventually appear in the action. Our review of the record indicates, as to the three named\ndefendants that are not parties to the appeal, defaults have been entered against two of\nthem (Dr. Daniel Shin and New Life Surgery Center, LLC) and the third appeared and\nanswered the complaint on June 22, 2012, two months before the court denied the\npetition to compel arbitration.\n\n                                              9\n\f       The surgery center defendants attempt to minimize this litigation conduct,\nclaiming, even if their participation in the litigation was substantial, it was not prejudicial.\nThey contend, because no trial date had been set and no discovery obtained by any party\nthat would not have been available in the arbitral forum, there can be no prejudice as a\nmatter of law. Although both factors are properly considered as part of the waiver\nanalysis, neither is dispositive. (See Lewis v. Fletcher Jones Motor Cars, Inc., supra,\n205 Cal.App.4th at p. 453 [fact no trial date had yet been set is not dispositive on the\nquestion of waiver and prejudice; \u201cnumerous cases [have found] waiver in which no trial\ndate [had been] set\u201d]; Roberts v.

In Groom the\ndefendant (Health Net) filed a series of demurrers to the original and amended complaints\nand served the plaintiff (Groom) with form and special interrogatories, requests for\nadmission and requests for production of documents. Eleven months after Health Net\nhad been served with the original complaint, it petitioned to compel arbitration. The trial\ncourt denied the petition on the ground Health Net had waived arbitration. Our\ncolleagues in Division Four of this court reversed, concluding there was no substantial\nevidence Groom had suffered any prejudice as a result of the delay in seeking arbitration.\n(Id. at p. 1196.) In reaching this conclusion Division Four found it significant that no\nresponses to the written discovery requests had been made, no depositions had been taken\nand no motions had been filed. (Ibid.) The court was not persuaded by Groom\u2019s\nargument that filing demurrers, a process unavailable in arbitration, had forced her to\narticulate in detail the legal theories underlying her causes of action: \u201cThis analogy is not\npersuasive. One can learn far more about an opponent\u2019s case through discovery than\nthrough demurrer. That is one of the reasons discovery procedures exist. [Citations.] In\nall the cases relied upon by Groom, prejudice was shown by the fact that by engaging in\ndiscovery, the defendant learned all the details of the plaintiff\u2019s case before demanding\narbitration.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, St. Agnes, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 1204 [insufficient evidence\nof waiver when the parties had not litigated the merits of the case and no discovery of the\nclaims had occurred].) Here, in contrast, the surgery center defendants engaged in the\nvery kind of extensive discovery and motion practice the court in Groom found lacking.\n       Similarly inapposite is our decision in Roman v.

Unlike the instant\n\n                                              11\n\fmatter, the petition to compel arbitration in Roman was filed a mere two months after the\ncomplaint; and \u201c[a]t the time, no substantive discovery responses had been served by\neither side and no formal hearings had taken place on the discovery issues.\u201d (Id. at\np. 1479.) To be sure, in confronting the far different procedural posture presented by that\ncase, we observed in Roman the limited discovery that had been served (a single set of\nform interrogatories and a single request for production of documents) was authorized\nunder the rules applicable to the arbitration. (Ibid.) While the far more extensive\ndiscovery already accomplished in this case may also have been available in the arbitral\nforum, that is but one factor for consideration in the waiver analysis and, under our\ndeferential standard of review, does not alone necessarily outweigh the other, substantial\nevidence in support of the trial court\u2019s waiver finding.

The superior court denied the petition,\nfinding the surgery center defendants had waived any contractual right to arbitrate the\nclaims against them. We affirm.\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       1. The Complaint\n       On September 2, 2011 the Walker plaintiffs filed this action in Los Angeles\nCounty Superior Court, Central District, alleging 52-year-old Walker had died after\nundergoing bariatric surgery on December 23, 2010 and asserting causes of action against\nthe surgery center defendants and several others for medical malpractice, intentional and\nnegligent misrepresentation, negligent referral, negligent hiring and negligent\nsupervision.\n       2. The Surgery Center Defendants\u2019 Active Motion and Discovery Practice\n       On November 18, 2011 Top Surgeons and 1-800-Get-Thin demurred to the\ncomplaint and moved to strike allegations relating to punitive damages. On\nDecember 16, 2011 Beverly Hills Surgery Center appeared and demurred to the two\ncauses of action alleged against it. It also moved to transfer the matter to the superior\ncourt\u2019s Western District (Santa Monica), contending the lawsuit had been improperly\nfiled in the Central District. None of the demurrers or motions mentioned an arbitration\nagreement.\n\n\n1\n      Brown filed the lawsuit both in her individual capacity and as executor of\nWalker\u2019s estate.\n\n                                              2\n\f       Beginning in December 2011 the surgery center defendants served broad ranging\nwritten discovery requests on the Walker plaintiffs, including two sets of form\ninterrogatories, special interrogatories, requests for admissions and multiple requests for\nproduction of documents. The surgery center defendants also responded to the Walker\nplaintiffs\u2019 similarly extensive written discovery requests.\n       In February 2012 the trial court granted Beverly Hills Surgery Center\u2019s motion to\ntransfer the lawsuit to the Western District. On April 9, 2012 the surgery center\ndefendants moved to compel further responses to interrogatories and document requests\nand sought discovery sanctions.\n       The surgery center defendants deposed each of the three Walker plaintiffs for\nseveral days in April 2012. In addition, Beverly Hills Surgery Center jointly noticed\n(along with another defendant who is not a party to the appeal) the deposition of\nCourtney Brown, Walker\u2019s former ward, and agreed to produce Charles Klasky, the\nsurgery center defendants\u2019 managing representative, for his noticed deposition once the\ndepositions of all three Walker plaintiffs had been completed. At no time during this\nactive discovery process did the surgery center defendants disclose the existence of the\narbitration agreements.\n       On June 1, 2012 the court sustained the surgery center defendants\u2019 demurrers to\nmost of the causes of action with leave to amend and denied their motions to strike. On\nJune 5, 2012 the Walker plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint.\n       On June 13, 2012 the surgery center defendants participated in the deposition of\nCourtney Brown. In a letter dated the same day, the surgery center defendants notified\nthe Walker plaintiffs of their intent to petition to compel arbitration in accordance with\nthe arbitration agreements Walker had signed unless the Walker plaintiffs stipulated to\nresolving their action in the arbitral forum. The Walker plaintiffs contested the\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fenforceability of the arbitration provision but agreed to stay additional discovery pending\nresolution of the arbitration controversy.2\n        3. The Petition To Compel Arbitration\n        On June 15, 2012 the surgery center defendants filed their petition to compel\narbitration of the claims against them based on six separate arbitration agreements\nWalker had signed prior to her surgery.3 Neither the petition nor the supporting papers\noffered any explanation for the delay in seeking arbitration.\n        The Walker plaintiffs opposed the petition, arguing (1) the arbitration agreements\nexecuted prior to December 23, 2010, the day of Walker\u2019s bariatric surgery, were\nimproperly authenticated and inadmissible; (2) the agreement to arbitrate signed on\nDecember 23, 2010 was unenforceable because Walker had died within the agreement\u2019s\n30-day rescission period; (3) only Beverly Hills Surgery Center had standing to enforce\nthe agreements; and (4) the surgery center defendants had waived any right to compel\narbitration.\n        In their reply papers the surgery center defendants insisted, among other things,\nthey had not waived their right to compel arbitration. Emphasizing the trial court had\nonly ruled on their demurrers and motions to strike on June 1, 2012, they argued \u201c[t]he\n\n2\n        The surgery center defendants\u2019 motions to compel were taken off calendar at that\ntime.\n3\n        Each of the six agreements provided, \u201cIt is understood that any dispute as to\nmedical malpractice, that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this\ncontract was [sic] unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly, negligently or\nincompetently rendered, will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided by\nCalifornia law, and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process except as California law\nprovides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings. Both parties to this contract, by\nentering into it, are giving up their constitutional right to have any such dispute decided\nin a court of law before a jury, and instead are accepting the use of arbitration. [\u00b6] It is\nthe intention of the parties that this Agreement bind all parties whose claims may arise\nout of or relate to the treatment or services provided . . . . [\u00b6] All claims against the\nhealth care provider, physician, surgeon, and/or any partners, associates, associations,\ncorporations or partnerships, and the employees, agents, independent contractors and/or\nestates of any of them, must be arbitrated, including without limitation, claims for loss of\nconsortium, wrongful death, wrongful life, emotional distress or punitive damages . . . .\u201d\n\n                                              4\n\flengthy [nine-month] gap between the filing of the initial [c]omplaint and [the surgery\ncenter] defendants\u2019 demand to compel arbitration [wa]s due primarily to the inability of\ndefendants to have their [demurrers and motions to strike] heard quickly. This was not in\ncontrol of the [surgery center] defendants.\u201d They did not offer any other explanation for\ntheir delay in seeking arbitration.4\n       After hearing argument and taking the matter under submission, the trial court\ndenied the petition. Assuming without deciding there was a valid arbitration agreement\nenforceable by each of the surgery center defendants and all claims fell within the scope\nof that agreement, the court found the surgery center defendants had waived (forfeited)\ntheir contractual right to arbitrate. In its August 21, 2012 order the court explained:\n\u201cDefendants argue it\u2019s \u2018not their fault\u2019 so much time elapsed, as it was due in large part to\nthe court\u2019s inability to hear the demurrers earlier. This is not the point. The point is that,\nif Defendants wanted to compel arbitration, they should have done that first, not after\nfiling demurrers and motions to strike. The Court finds Defendants waived their right to\nmove to compel arbitration by filing demurrers and motions to strike, propounding and\nresponding to discovery, and failing to file this motion until [June 15, 2012], more than\nsix months after they initially appeared in connection with the case.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n4\n        At the hearing on the petition to compel arbitration, the court expressed doubt\nabout the surgery center defendants\u2019 purported lack of knowledge of the arbitration\nagreements. Counsel for the surgery center defendants explained she, as well as her\npredecessor counsel, had been unaware of the arbitration agreements due to staff turnover\nin the surgery center defendants\u2019 general counsel\u2019s office; and she had acted promptly to\ncompel arbitration once she learned of them. When counsel for the Walker plaintiffs\nappeared to question those representations, the court interjected, making clear it took\ncounsel at her word with regard to her own actions and those of her predecessor counsel,\nbut distinguished between counsel\u2019s ignorance of the arbitration agreements and that of\nher clients.\n\n                                              5\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n       1. Governing Law and Standard of Review\n       California\u2019s strong public policy favors arbitration as a relatively quick and cost-\neffective means to resolve disputes. (Moncharsh v. Heily & Blase (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 9;\nSt. Agnes Medical Center v. PacifiCare of California (2003) 31 Cal.4th 1187, 1195 (St.\nAgnes); Engalla v. Permanente Medical Group, Inc. (1997) 15 Cal.4th 951, 971-972.)\nAbsent certain limited exceptions, California law requires the trial court to enforce a valid\nwritten agreement to arbitrate any controversy that falls within the scope of the\nagreement unless \u201cthe right to compel arbitration has been waived\u201d by the moving party.\n(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1281.2, subd. (a).)5\n       \u201cIn the arbitration context, \u2018[t]he term \u201cwaiver\u201d [is] used as a shorthand statement\nfor the conclusion that a contractual right to arbitration has been lost.\u2019\u201d (St. Agnes, supra,\n31 Cal.4th at p. 1195, fn. 4; accord, Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson (1993) 6 Cal.4th 307,\n315.) \u201cThis does not require a voluntary relinquishment of a known right; to the\ncontrary, a party may be said to have \u2018waived\u2019 its right to arbitrate by an untimely\ndemand, even without intending to give up the remedy. In this context, waiver is more\nlike a forfeiture arising from the nonperformance of a required act.\u201d (Burton v. Cruise\n(2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 939, 944; accord, Platt Pacific, Inc., at pp. 314-315.)\n       In light of the strong public policy favoring arbitration, claims of waiver are\nsubject to \u201cclose judicial scrutiny,\u201d and the \u201cparty seeking to establish a waiver bears a\nheavy burden\u201d with all doubts resolved in favor of arbitration. (St. Agnes, supra,\n31 Cal.4th at p. 1195; Lewis v. Fletcher Jones Motor Cars, Inc. (2012) 205 Cal.App.4th\n436, 443.) While \u201cno single test\u201d can delineate all the possible conduct that may\nconstitute a waiver of arbitration (St. Agnes, at p. 1195), in assessing whether waiver has\n\n5\n        Federal law, which also recognizes and enforces a strong public policy favoring\narbitration (St. Agnes, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 1204; AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion\n(2011) 563 U.S. ___ [131 S.Ct. 1740, 1745, 179 L.Ed.2d 742]), similarly acknowledges\nthe right to arbitrate may be forfeited under certain circumstances. (See St. Agnes, at\np. 1195.) Here, neither party disputes the agreements are governed by California law, not\nthe Federal Arbitration Act.\n\n                                              6\n\foccurred, the trial court is guided by the six relevant factors identified by the Supreme\nCourt in St. Agnes: \u201c(1) [W]hether the party\u2019s actions are inconsistent with the right to\narbitrate; (2) whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the\nparties were well into the preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing\nparty of an intent to arbitrate; (3) whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement\nclose to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay; (4) whether a\ndefendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the\nproceedings; (5) whether important intervening steps [e.g., taking advantage of judicial\ndiscovery procedures not available in arbitration] had taken place; and (6) whether the\ndelay affected, misled or prejudiced the opposing party.\u201d (Id. at p. 1196 [second set of\nbrackets in original; internal quotation marks omitted]; accord, Lewis v. Fletcher Jones\nMotor Cars, Inc., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 445; cf. Burton v. Cruise, supra,\n190 Cal.App.4th at pp. 944-945 [applying a four factor test when two of the factors\nidentified in St. Agnes\u2014whether a defendant seeking arbitration had filed a counterclaim\nand whether important intervening steps had taken place\u2014were not applicable].)\n       Waiver does not occur by \u201cmere participation in litigation.\u201d (St. Agnes, supra,\n31 Cal.4th at p. 1203.) There must also be prejudice. (Id. at pp. 1203-1204; Hoover v.\nAmerican Income Life Ins. Co. (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1193, 1205 [prejudice is critical\nto the analysis of waiver; absent prejudice, there can be no waiver].) Prejudice,\nmoreover, is not established merely by showing the nonmoving party has incurred costs\nand legal expenses in connection with the litigation. (St. Agnes, at p. 1203; Roman v.\nSuperior Court (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1462, 1479.) Prejudice may arise, however,\nwhen the petitioning party has \u201cunreasonably delayed\u201d in seeking arbitration (St. Agnes,\nat pp. 1203-1204; Burton v. Cruise, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at p. 947) or has substantially\nimpaired an opponent\u2019s ability to obtain the benefits and efficiencies of arbitration.\n(Guess?, Inc. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 553, 555, 558, fn. 1; Hoover, at\np. 1205; Adolph v. Coastal Auto Sales, Inc. (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1443, 1451-1452.)\n       \u201cGenerally, the determination of waiver is a question of fact, and the trial court\u2019s\nfinding, if supported by sufficient evidence, is binding on the appellate court.\u201d\n\n                                              7\n\f(St. Agnes, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 1196; accord, Burton v. Cruise, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 946 [\u201c\u2018\u201c[i]t was the trial court\u2019s duty to determine whether\u201d the petitioners met their\n\u201cburden of proof; it is our duty to determine whether there is substantial evidence to\nsupport the trial court\u2019s findings that it did\u201d\u2019\u201d].) \u201cWe construe any reasonable inference\nin the manner most favorable to the judgment, resolving all ambiguities to support an\naffirmance.\u201d (Burton, at p. 946; accord, Adolph v. Coastal Auto Sales, Inc., supra, 184\nCal.App.4th at p. 1452.) It is only when \u201c\u2018the facts are undisputed and only one\ninference may reasonably be drawn\u2019\u201d that the issue is one of law. (St. Agnes, at p. 1196;\naccord, Platt Pacific, Inc. v. Andelson, supra, 6 Cal.4th at p. 319; Hoover, at p. 1202.)\n       2. The Trial Court\u2019s Finding of Waiver Is Supported by Substantial Evidence and\n          Is Not Erroneous As a Matter of Law\n       In challenging the trial court\u2019s waiver finding, the surgery center defendants focus\ntheir attention on whether \u201cthe litigation machinery ha[d] been substantially invoked\u201d and\nwhether their delay in seeking arbitration prejudiced the Walker plaintiffs. They insist\nthe answer to both questions is indisputably no, emphasizing the instant litigation is still\nin its early stages: No trial date has been set; no responsive pleading to the first amended\ncomplaint has yet been filed; no experts have been designated; and no depositions have\nactually been taken by the Walker plaintiffs. The \u201cminimal discovery\u201d that has taken\nplace\u2014the written discovery propounded and responded to by both sides and the\ncompleted depositions of the three plaintiffs and a plaintiff\u2019s witness\u2014was preliminary in\nnature and would have been available in arbitration as well.6 Absent a showing the delay\n\n\n6\n       Five of the six arbitration agreements state discovery shall be conducted pursuant\nto Code of Civil Procedure section 1283.05, which vests parties to an arbitration\nagreement with the same rights as provided in the statutes governing discovery in a\njudicial forum except that leave of the arbitrator is required before depositions may be\ntaken. As to that limiting requirement, however, the five agreements expressly state\nleave of the arbitrator is not required to take depositions. The December 23, 2010\nagreement is slightly different: It provides \u201c[a]ll laws of California Civil Procedure shall\napply including but not limited to discovery\u201d unless the parties agree to waive such\nrequirements. It thus appears leave of the arbitrator would be required to conduct\ndepositions under this agreement unless the parties waived this requirement.\n\n                                              8\n\fhas caused any actual prejudice, they argue, the evidence in this case is insufficient as a\nmatter of law to sustain the court\u2019s findings of waiver. (See St. Agnes, supra, 31 Cal.4th\nat p. 1203; Roman v. Superior Court, supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 1479; cf. Burton v.\nCruise, supra, 190 Cal.App.4th at pp. 949, 950 [upholding trial court\u2019s finding of waiver\nwhere defendants participated in litigation for 11 months, filed several demurrers and\nmotions to compel discovery, a trial date had been set, discovery taken and experts had\nbeen designated with a jury in mind].)7\n       The surgery center defendants present a solid case for an initial finding of\nnonwaiver. However, as discussed, our review is limited to determining whether the\nevidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the trial court\u2019s finding of waiver.\nConstruing all reasonable inferences in support of the court\u2019s order, as we must, the\nrecord simply does not establish nonwaiver as a matter of law. (See Lewis v. Fletcher\nJones Motor Cars, Inc., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 453 [\u201c[i]t is not enough the trial\ncourt potentially could have reached a different conclusion; rather, we may reverse the\ntrial court\u2019s waiver finding only if the record establishes a lack of waiver as a matter of\nlaw\u201d]; Hoover v. American Income Life Ins. Co., supra, 206 Cal.App.4th at p. 1202\n[same].)\n       The surgery center defendants vigorously attacked the pleadings, filing demurrers\nand motions to strike; deposed each plaintiff; participated in the deposition of a nonparty\nwitness; served and responded to extensive written discovery; and filed motions to\ncompel coupled with requests for discovery sanctions. There can be little question they\nactively litigated in the judicial forum in a manner wholly inconsistent with any intent to\narbitrate.\n\n\n7\n       The surgery center defendants also argue that not all named defendants have\nappeared in the action. However, they fail to specify which nonappearing defendant will\neventually appear in the action. Our review of the record indicates, as to the three named\ndefendants that are not parties to the appeal, defaults have been entered against two of\nthem (Dr. Daniel Shin and New Life Surgery Center, LLC) and the third appeared and\nanswered the complaint on June 22, 2012, two months before the court denied the\npetition to compel arbitration.\n\n                                              9\n\f       The surgery center defendants attempt to minimize this litigation conduct,\nclaiming, even if their participation in the litigation was substantial, it was not prejudicial.\nThey contend, because no trial date had been set and no discovery obtained by any party\nthat would not have been available in the arbitral forum, there can be no prejudice as a\nmatter of law. Although both factors are properly considered as part of the waiver\nanalysis, neither is dispositive. (See Lewis v. Fletcher Jones Motor Cars, Inc., supra,\n205 Cal.App.4th at p. 453 [fact no trial date had yet been set is not dispositive on the\nquestion of waiver and prejudice; \u201cnumerous cases [have found] waiver in which no trial\ndate [had been] set\u201d]; Roberts v. El Cajon Motors, Inc. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 832, 844-\n845 & fn. 9 [same]; Guess?, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 79 Cal.App.4th at p. 558\n[waiver found where moving party filed motions and participated in discovery, taking\n\u201cfull advantage of the opportunity to test the validity of Guess\u2019s claims both legally and\nfactually\u201d before seeking arbitration].)\n       The trial court found the surgery defendants\u2019 delay in seeking arbitration and their\nproffered explanations for it\u2014the court\u2019s delay in ruling on their demurrers and counsel\u2019s\nrepresentation concerning the surgery center defendants\u2019 lack of awareness of the\nagreements\u2014patently unreasonable, seemingly designed to take advantage of both the\njudicial forum when convenient and the arbitral forum once it appeared that litigation\ncould be protracted. (See Guess?, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 79 Cal.App.4th at p. 558\n[four-month delay in seeking arbitration prejudicial when defendant answered complaint,\nresponded to discovery, participated in depositions and filed an unsuccessful motion to\nstay action; \u201c\u2018\u201c[t]he courtroom may not be used as a convenient vestibule to the\narbitration hall so as to allow a party to create his own unique structure combining\nlitigation and arbitration\u201d\u2019\u201d].) As a result, it impliedly found, the Walker plaintiffs lost\nmore than simply time and the expenses and fees incurred in the litigation; they lost the\ninherent advantages of the efficiencies of arbitration. (See Burton v. Cruise, supra,\n190 Cal.App.4th at p. 949 [\u201csubstantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s implicit\ndetermination that granting Burton\u2019s belated arbitration request deprived Cruise of the\nbenefits available through arbitration, including a speedy resolution of the dispute\u201d];\n\n                                              10\n\fLewis v. Fletcher Jones Motor Cars, Inc., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th 436, 449-453\n[defendant\u2019s filing of demurrers and motions to strike and participation in discovery\nwithout raising its right to arbitrate resulted in prejudicial delay and waiver of arbitration\nright].)\n       The analysis in Groom v. Health Net (2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1189, on which the\nsurgery center defendants rely, does not compel a different result. In Groom the\ndefendant (Health Net) filed a series of demurrers to the original and amended complaints\nand served the plaintiff (Groom) with form and special interrogatories, requests for\nadmission and requests for production of documents. Eleven months after Health Net\nhad been served with the original complaint, it petitioned to compel arbitration. The trial\ncourt denied the petition on the ground Health Net had waived arbitration. Our\ncolleagues in Division Four of this court reversed, concluding there was no substantial\nevidence Groom had suffered any prejudice as a result of the delay in seeking arbitration.\n(Id. at p. 1196.) In reaching this conclusion Division Four found it significant that no\nresponses to the written discovery requests had been made, no depositions had been taken\nand no motions had been filed. (Ibid.) The court was not persuaded by Groom\u2019s\nargument that filing demurrers, a process unavailable in arbitration, had forced her to\narticulate in detail the legal theories underlying her causes of action: \u201cThis analogy is not\npersuasive. One can learn far more about an opponent\u2019s case through discovery than\nthrough demurrer. That is one of the reasons discovery procedures exist. [Citations.] In\nall the cases relied upon by Groom, prejudice was shown by the fact that by engaging in\ndiscovery, the defendant learned all the details of the plaintiff\u2019s case before demanding\narbitration.\u201d (Ibid.; accord, St. Agnes, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 1204 [insufficient evidence\nof waiver when the parties had not litigated the merits of the case and no discovery of the\nclaims had occurred].) Here, in contrast, the surgery center defendants engaged in the\nvery kind of extensive discovery and motion practice the court in Groom found lacking.\n       Similarly inapposite is our decision in Roman v. Superior Court, supra,\n172 Cal.App.4th 1462, in which we upheld the trial court\u2019s implied finding that the\ndefendants\u2019 participation in litigation had not resulted in a waiver. Unlike the instant\n\n                                              11\n\fmatter, the petition to compel arbitration in Roman was filed a mere two months after the\ncomplaint; and \u201c[a]t the time, no substantive discovery responses had been served by\neither side and no formal hearings had taken place on the discovery issues.\u201d (Id. at\np. 1479.) To be sure, in confronting the far different procedural posture presented by that\ncase, we observed in Roman the limited discovery that had been served (a single set of\nform interrogatories and a single request for production of documents) was authorized\nunder the rules applicable to the arbitration. (Ibid.) While the far more extensive\ndiscovery already accomplished in this case may also have been available in the arbitral\nforum, that is but one factor for consideration in the waiver analysis and, under our\ndeferential standard of review, does not alone necessarily outweigh the other, substantial\nevidence in support of the trial court\u2019s waiver finding. (See Lewis v. Fletcher Jones\nMotor Cars, Inc., supra, 205 Cal.App.4th at pp. 449-453.)\n       In sum, because the record here does not require a finding of no waiver as a matter\nof law (St. Agnes, supra, 31 Cal.4th at p. 1196; Lewis v. Fletcher Jones Motor Cars, Inc.,\nsupra, 205 Cal.App.4th at p. 453), we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.\n                                       DISPOSITION\n       The order denying the petition to compel arbitration is affirmed. The Walker\nplaintiffs are to recover their costs on appeal.\n\n\n                                                   PERLUSS, P.
