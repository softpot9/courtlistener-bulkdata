See id. at 806.    The court then\n\nconcluded that the system allowed the broad exercise of discretion and that \u201cFERC\n\nhas specifically declined to consider the prudency or wisdom of a purchaser\u2019s\n\nchoices between available power supply options, or whether a purchaser \u2018has made\n\nthe best deal available.\u2019\u201d Id.

The Jenkins I court also referred to Central Vermont\n\nPublic Service Corp., in which the Commission cited Pennsylvania Power and\n\nLight Co. and noted that \u201c[FERC] has consistently recognized that wholesale\n\nratemaking does not, as a general matter, determine whether a purchaser has\n\nprudently chosen from among available supply options.\u201d Cent.

Noting that \u201c[t]hat is exactly what appears to be in\n\nissue here,\u201d the Jenkins I court concluded that FERC had not exercised jurisdiction\n\nover this case. Jenkins, 187 S.W.3d at 805, 807.\n\n      However, in the years since Jenkins I was decided, FERC has begun to\n\nexercise its jurisdiction over complaints that Entergy imprudently operated its\n\ncentralized purchasing system by relying on its own power generation rather than\n\npurchasing cheaper power from third parties. See Entergy Servs. Inc., 128 FERC \u00b6\n\n63,015 (2009), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 137 FERC \u00b6 61,029 (2011); Entergy\n\n                                        4\n\fServs. Inc., 124 FERC \u00b6 63,026 (2008), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 130 FERC\n\n\u00b6 61,023 (2010), La.

These regulatory decisions are the \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d that plaintiffs\n\nacknowledged might cause state court jurisdiction to give way.1 They also address\n\nthe statement in Jenkins I that FERC has \u201cdeclined to consider the prudency or\n\nwisdom of a purchaser\u2019s choices between available power supply options . . . .\u201d\n\nJenkins, 187 S.W.3d at 806.\n\n      In Entergy Services, Inc., 128 FERC \u00b6 63,015 (2009), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in\n\npart, 137 FERC \u00b6 61,029 (2011), the Commission considered, among other issues,\n\nwhether Entergy had \u201cimprudently established [its] minimum capacity generation\n\nlevels for its generating units for making commitment and dispatch that exceed\n\nactual minimum capacity values, thus decreasing the potential savings from off-\n\nsystem purchases from merchants . . . .\u201d Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 178\u201384. In its ruling on the\n\nissue, FERC stated:\n\n      As noted above, in its initial evidentiary filing, the Louisiana [Public\n      Service Commission] raised the possibility that Entergy was not\n      operating its generation units in a prudent manner. Entergy responded\n      by explaining why its operations were prudent. At the hearing, [] the\n      Louisiana PSC witness who first questioned Entergy\u2019s operation,\n\n\n1\n      In its Brief for Respondents in Opposition to Petitioners\u2019 Application for Writ of\n      Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, Jenkins stated, \u201cThus, it appears\n      that, if petitioners were to seek a FERC determination that respondents\u2019 complaint\n      raises matters within its jurisdiction, and FERC decided to address those\n      questions, state court jurisdiction might ultimately give way.\u201d\n                                          5\n\f       testified that he could find no evidence supporting his initial allegation\n       ....\n\n       In view of the above, I find that the Louisiana PSC failed to carry its\n       burden of proof on this issue.\n\nId. at \u00b6\u00b6 183\u2013184.\n\n       Jenkins argues that because Louisiana PSC failed to present evidence and\n\nFERC made no findings on the issue, this case \u201cdoes not reach, much less cover,\n\n[Jenkins\u2019s] claims.\u201d The fact that FERC found that Louisiana PSC had failed to\n\ncarry its burden of proof before it is an evidentiary finding. The Commission\u2019s\n\nconsideration of the issue and subsequent ruling constitute an exercise of FERC\u2019s\n\njurisdiction over Entergy\u2019s decisions to generate or purchase power from third\n\nparties\u2014the very decisions at issue here.\n\n       In Entergy Services Inc., 124 FERC \u00b6 63,026 (2008), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in\n\npart, 130 FERC \u00b6 61,023 (2010), the Commission considered Louisiana PSC\u2019s\n\nclaim that Entergy had acted imprudently in deciding not to purchase one of its\n\ngeneration units. See id. at \u00b6 280. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found\n\nthat Louisiana PSC had failed to raise serious doubts of imprudence and that, even\n\nif it had, Entergy\u2019s evidence rebutted that position and established that \u201cEntergy\n\nhas reasonably operated its system so as to minimize production costs, and to\n\nmaintain reliability . . . .\u201d Id. at \u00b6 317.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      In its brief, Jenkins first notes that Entergy failed to cite the subsequent\n\nopinion in which the full Commission rejected Entergy\u2019s request that the ALJ\u2019s\n\ngeneral finding regarding Entergy\u2019s purchasing decisions bar prudence claims\n\nraised in the future.2 Jenkins then concludes that the original decision \u201cdoes not\n\naffect any of the Jenkins [I] court\u2019s conclusions.\u201d However, this FERC decision\n\nexplicitly addresses the Entergy System\u2019s purchasing decisions. The Commission\n\ndetermined that Louisiana PSC had failed to satisfy its evidentiary burden which\n\nbears directly on the issue of whether FERC has exercised jurisdiction over the\n\nsubject matter. This case is another instance in which FERC has asserted its\n\njurisdiction over Entergy\u2019s purchasing practices and the prudence of its\n\ndecisions\u2014the very subject matter of Jenkins\u2019s claims.\n\n      In a third case, Louisiana Public Service Commission v. Entergy Corp., 139\n\nFERC \u00b6 61,240 (2012), FERC considered a complaint that an Entergy company\n\nhad engaged in imprudent conduct by selling inexpensive Entergy-generated power\n\nto third-party marketers. Id. at \u00b6 1\u20132. The ALJ found that the company had acted\n\nimprudently, in violation of the ESA, and ordered refunds. See id. This decision is\n\n\n2\n      In the Initial Decision, the ALJ found that Entergy \u201chistorically has generally\n      purchased power, including economy energy, from third parties instead of running\n      its own facilities when it is economic to do so and is consistent with operational\n      and reliability requirement[s].\u201d Id. at \u00b6 668 (footnote omitted). The full\n      Commission subsequently rejected Entergy\u2019s request that it find future prudence\n      claims barred by res judicata. Entergy Servs., Inc., 130 FERC \u00b6 61,023, at \u00b6 70.\n\n                                          7\n\fanother example of FERC exercising its jurisdiction over claims that Entergy\n\nengaged in imprudent operating practices.3\n\n      The Jenkins I court presciently recognized that \u201cFERC jurisdiction could\n\npotentially expand to encompass this dispute . . . .\u201d Jenkins, 187 S.W.3d at 807. In\n\nlight of the decisions discussed above, it is clear that it has done so. If FERC\n\nexercises jurisdiction over a particular issue, then under the FPA regulatory\n\nscheme, it has exclusive jurisdiction. See Miss. Power & Light Co., 487 U.S. at\n\n374, 108 S. Ct. at 2440 (concluding states may not regulate in areas where FERC\n\nhas properly exercised its jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale\n\nrates or to insure that agreements affecting wholesale rates are reasonable). Given\n\nthese changed circumstances, we are not bound to follow the decision in Jenkins I.\n\nSee Briscoe v. Goodmark Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1370803\"><a href=\"/opinion/1370803/briscoe-v-goodmark-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716 (Tex. 2003). I believe these\n\ndecisions demonstrate that FERC has preemptive jurisdiction over Jenkins\u2019s\n\nclaims. Accordingly, I join the majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Jenkins points out that, during the proceedings of that case, Entergy argued that\n      the matters at issue did not raise the same issues as those before the Louisiana PSC\n      in Delaney v. Entergy Louisiana, Inc., Docket No. U-23366 (La. P.S.C. 2000), in\n      which Louisiana asserted claims similar to Jenkins\u2019s claims here. Jenkins then\n      notes that FERC agreed with Entergy, and that FERC\u2019s discussion of Delaney,\n      which included no criticism of Louisiana\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in that case, \u201cis\n      clear evidence that claims like Plaintiffs\u2019 in this case bear no relevance to the\n      proceedings before FERC.\u201d The Delaney decision was issued in 2000\u2014six years\n      before Jenkins I and well before the FERC decisions discussed here.\n                                            8\n\f                                            Russell Lloyd\n                                            Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Huddle, and Lloyd.\n\nJustice Lloyd, concurring.\n\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f</pre>", "Case_Text": "Concurring opinion issued July 28, 2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  In The\n\n                            Court of Appeals\n                                  For The\n\n                        First District of Texas\n                         \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n                           NO. 01-12-00470-CV\n                         \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n  ENTERGY CORPORATION, ENTERGY SERVICES, INC., ENTERGY\n   POWER, INC., ENTERGY POWER MARKETING CORPORATION,\n ENTERGY ARKANSAS, INC., AND ENTERGY TEXAS, INC., Appellants\n                                    V.\n DAVID JENKINS, GEORGE W.

The Jenkins I court also referred to Central Vermont\n\nPublic Service Corp., in which the Commission cited Pennsylvania Power and\n\nLight Co. and noted that \u201c[FERC] has consistently recognized that wholesale\n\nratemaking does not, as a general matter, determine whether a purchaser has\n\nprudently chosen from among available supply options.\u201d Cent. Vt. Pub. Serv.\n\nCorp., 84 FERC \u00b6 61,194 at 61,975 (1998) (citing Pa. Power & Light Co., 23\n\nFERC \u00b6 61,325 at 61,716). Noting that \u201c[t]hat is exactly what appears to be in\n\nissue here,\u201d the Jenkins I court concluded that FERC had not exercised jurisdiction\n\nover this case. Jenkins, 187 S.W.3d at 805, 807.\n\n      However, in the years since Jenkins I was decided, FERC has begun to\n\nexercise its jurisdiction over complaints that Entergy imprudently operated its\n\ncentralized purchasing system by relying on its own power generation rather than\n\npurchasing cheaper power from third parties. See Entergy Servs. Inc., 128 FERC \u00b6\n\n63,015 (2009), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 137 FERC \u00b6 61,029 (2011); Entergy\n\n                                        4\n\fServs. Inc., 124 FERC \u00b6 63,026 (2008), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 130 FERC\n\n\u00b6 61,023 (2010), La.

These regulatory decisions are the \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d that plaintiffs\n\nacknowledged might cause state court jurisdiction to give way.1 They also address\n\nthe statement in Jenkins I that FERC has \u201cdeclined to consider the prudency or\n\nwisdom of a purchaser\u2019s choices between available power supply options . . . .\u201d\n\nJenkins, 187 S.W.3d at 806.\n\n      In Entergy Services, Inc., 128 FERC \u00b6 63,015 (2009), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in\n\npart, 137 FERC \u00b6 61,029 (2011), the Commission considered, among other issues,\n\nwhether Entergy had \u201cimprudently established [its] minimum capacity generation\n\nlevels for its generating units for making commitment and dispatch that exceed\n\nactual minimum capacity values, thus decreasing the potential savings from off-\n\nsystem purchases from merchants . . . .\u201d Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 178\u201384. In its ruling on the\n\nissue, FERC stated:\n\n      As noted above, in its initial evidentiary filing, the Louisiana [Public\n      Service Commission] raised the possibility that Entergy was not\n      operating its generation units in a prudent manner. Entergy responded\n      by explaining why its operations were prudent. At the hearing, [] the\n      Louisiana PSC witness who first questioned Entergy\u2019s operation,\n\n\n1\n      In its Brief for Respondents in Opposition to Petitioners\u2019 Application for Writ of\n      Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, Jenkins stated, \u201cThus, it appears\n      that, if petitioners were to seek a FERC determination that respondents\u2019 complaint\n      raises matters within its jurisdiction, and FERC decided to address those\n      questions, state court jurisdiction might ultimately give way.\u201d\n                                          5\n\f       testified that he could find no evidence supporting his initial allegation\n       ....\n\n       In view of the above, I find that the Louisiana PSC failed to carry its\n       burden of proof on this issue.\n\nId. at \u00b6\u00b6 183\u2013184.\n\n       Jenkins argues that because Louisiana PSC failed to present evidence and\n\nFERC made no findings on the issue, this case \u201cdoes not reach, much less cover,\n\n[Jenkins\u2019s] claims.\u201d The fact that FERC found that Louisiana PSC had failed to\n\ncarry its burden of proof before it is an evidentiary finding. The Commission\u2019s\n\nconsideration of the issue and subsequent ruling constitute an exercise of FERC\u2019s\n\njurisdiction over Entergy\u2019s decisions to generate or purchase power from third\n\nparties\u2014the very decisions at issue here.\n\n       In Entergy Services Inc., 124 FERC \u00b6 63,026 (2008), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in\n\npart, 130 FERC \u00b6 61,023 (2010), the Commission considered Louisiana PSC\u2019s\n\nclaim that Entergy had acted imprudently in deciding not to purchase one of its\n\ngeneration units. See id. at \u00b6 280. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found\n\nthat Louisiana PSC had failed to raise serious doubts of imprudence and that, even\n\nif it had, Entergy\u2019s evidence rebutted that position and established that \u201cEntergy\n\nhas reasonably operated its system so as to minimize production costs, and to\n\nmaintain reliability . . . .\u201d Id. at \u00b6 317.\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      In its brief, Jenkins first notes that Entergy failed to cite the subsequent\n\nopinion in which the full Commission rejected Entergy\u2019s request that the ALJ\u2019s\n\ngeneral finding regarding Entergy\u2019s purchasing decisions bar prudence claims\n\nraised in the future.2 Jenkins then concludes that the original decision \u201cdoes not\n\naffect any of the Jenkins [I] court\u2019s conclusions.\u201d However, this FERC decision\n\nexplicitly addresses the Entergy System\u2019s purchasing decisions. The Commission\n\ndetermined that Louisiana PSC had failed to satisfy its evidentiary burden which\n\nbears directly on the issue of whether FERC has exercised jurisdiction over the\n\nsubject matter. This case is another instance in which FERC has asserted its\n\njurisdiction over Entergy\u2019s purchasing practices and the prudence of its\n\ndecisions\u2014the very subject matter of Jenkins\u2019s claims.\n\n      In a third case, Louisiana Public Service Commission v. Entergy Corp., 139\n\nFERC \u00b6 61,240 (2012), FERC considered a complaint that an Entergy company\n\nhad engaged in imprudent conduct by selling inexpensive Entergy-generated power\n\nto third-party marketers. Id. at \u00b6 1\u20132. The ALJ found that the company had acted\n\nimprudently, in violation of the ESA, and ordered refunds. See id. This decision is\n\n\n2\n      In the Initial Decision, the ALJ found that Entergy \u201chistorically has generally\n      purchased power, including economy energy, from third parties instead of running\n      its own facilities when it is economic to do so and is consistent with operational\n      and reliability requirement[s].\u201d Id. at \u00b6 668 (footnote omitted). The full\n      Commission subsequently rejected Entergy\u2019s request that it find future prudence\n      claims barred by res judicata. Entergy Servs., Inc., 130 FERC \u00b6 61,023, at \u00b6 70.\n\n                                          7\n\fanother example of FERC exercising its jurisdiction over claims that Entergy\n\nengaged in imprudent operating practices.3\n\n      The Jenkins I court presciently recognized that \u201cFERC jurisdiction could\n\npotentially expand to encompass this dispute . . . .\u201d Jenkins, 187 S.W.3d at 807. In\n\nlight of the decisions discussed above, it is clear that it has done so. If FERC\n\nexercises jurisdiction over a particular issue, then under the FPA regulatory\n\nscheme, it has exclusive jurisdiction. See Miss. Power & Light Co., 487 U.S. at\n\n374, 108 S. Ct. at 2440 (concluding states may not regulate in areas where FERC\n\nhas properly exercised its jurisdiction to determine just and reasonable wholesale\n\nrates or to insure that agreements affecting wholesale rates are reasonable). Given\n\nthese changed circumstances, we are not bound to follow the decision in Jenkins I.\n\nSee Briscoe v. Goodmark Corp., 102 S.W.3d 714, 716 (Tex. 2003). I believe these\n\ndecisions demonstrate that FERC has preemptive jurisdiction over Jenkins\u2019s\n\nclaims. Accordingly, I join the majority opinion.\n\n\n\n\n3\n      Jenkins points out that, during the proceedings of that case, Entergy argued that\n      the matters at issue did not raise the same issues as those before the Louisiana PSC\n      in Delaney v. Entergy Louisiana, Inc., Docket No. U-23366 (La. P.S.C. 2000), in\n      which Louisiana asserted claims similar to Jenkins\u2019s claims here. Jenkins then\n      notes that FERC agreed with Entergy, and that FERC\u2019s discussion of Delaney,\n      which included no criticism of Louisiana\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in that case, \u201cis\n      clear evidence that claims like Plaintiffs\u2019 in this case bear no relevance to the\n      proceedings before FERC.\u201d The Delaney decision was issued in 2000\u2014six years\n      before Jenkins I and well before the FERC decisions discussed here.\n                                            8\n\f                                            Russell Lloyd\n                                            Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Huddle, and Lloyd.\n\nJustice Lloyd, concurring.\n\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "901f845aadf6559152e8de7ede523b7eda4d7f0a", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals of Texas", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112130/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/130142/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1370803/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2102613/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2015-07-29T03:29:26.512023Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 9, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/2821181/entergy-corporation-entergy-services-inc-entergy-power-inc-entergy/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "2821181", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": " (July 28,2015)", "CL_opinion_local_path": "pdf/2015/07/28/entergy_corporation_entergy_services_inc._entergy_power_inc._entergy_1.pdf", "LDA_Model_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_cluster": {"state_cite_two": "", "date_blocked": null, "syllabus": "", "posture": "", "federal_cite_one": "", "case_name_short": "", "date_filed": "2015-07-28", "federal_cite_two": "", "docket": {"court": {"has_opinion_scraper": true, "in_use": true, "url": "http://www.courts.state.tx.us/courts/coa.asp", "start_date": null, "full_name": "Court of Appeals of Texas", "date_modified": "2014-08-08T17:27:23.258000Z", "position": 368.2, "jurisdiction": "SA", "has_oral_argument_scraper": false, "resource_uri": "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/courts/texapp/", "citation_string": "Tex.
