In these related original proceedings, the\n\npetitioners petitioned this court pursuant to the Hawai#i\n\nConstitution, article IV, section 10, quoted infra, for: (1) a\n\njudgment invalidating the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan for the\n\nstate legislature adopted and filed on September 26, 2011 by the\n\nState of Hawai#i 2011 Reapportionment Commission; (2) a writ of\n\nmandamus directing the Reapportionment Commission to prepare and\n\nfile a new reapportionment plan for the state legislature; and\n\n(3) a writ of mandamus directing the Chief Election Officer to\n\nrescind the publication of the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan.\n\n           On January 4, 2012, we issued orders granting the\n\npetitions.    We concluded that the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan\n\nis constitutionally invalid because: (1) the Hawai#i\n\nConstitution, article IV, section 4, expressly mandates that only\n\npermanent residents be counted in the population base for the\n\npurpose of reapportionment and (2) the 2011 Final Reapportionment\n\nPlan disregards this constitutional mandate by including non-\n\npermanent residents in the population base that the\n\nReapportionment Commission used to allocate the members of the\n\nstate legislature among the basic island units.             We invalidated\n\nthe 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan and directed the\n\nReapportionment Commission to prepare and file a new\n\nreapportionment plan that: (1) allocates the members of the state\n\nlegislature among the basic island units by using a permanent\n\nresident population base, and then (2) apportions the members\n\n                                       2\n\f   ***    FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST'S HAW AI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***\n\namong the districts therein as provided by article IV, section 6.\n\nWe further directed the Chief Election Officer to rescind the\n\npublication of the 2011 Final Reapportionment Plan for the state\n\nlegislature.\n\n                                I.   BACKGROUND\n\n                                       A.\n\n            The Hawai#i Constitution, article IV (Reapportionment),\n\nrequires, every tenth year after 1981, reapportionment for the\n\nstate legislature and congressional districts.              Reapportionment\n\nis effected by a reapportionment plan filed by a nine-member\n\nreapportionment commission constituted in the reapportionment\n\nyear.\n\n            Article IV, as originally enacted in 1978, provided for\n\nreapportionment of the state legislature by requiring allocation\n\n-- among the four basic island units of the 25 senatorial\n\ndistricts and the 51 house of representative districts -- \"on the\n\nbasis of the number of voters registered in the last preceding\n\ngeneral election.\"       Though the registered voter basis was upheld\n\nas constitutional by the United States Supreme Court because it\n\napproximated a plan based on a permissible population base,1 the\n\n1991 Reapportionment Commission concluded, after analyzing its\n\ndata, that use of the voter registration basis would not result\n\nin a constitutionally permissible apportionment plan.                It\n\n\n\n     1\n         Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 96 (1966)\n\n                                        3\n\fselected, as an alternative apportionment base, the permanent\n\nresident population, identified as the total population derived\n\nfrom the 1990 census, less transients.   It hired a research firm\n\nto \"determine which transients were counted in the census, how\n\nmany there were and whether or not they could be located in\n\nspecific census blocks.\"   The research firm, upon consultation,\n\nreported to the 1991 Reapportionment Commission that \"the\n\nnonresident military is the only large, census-block-identifiable\n\ngroup of nonresidents included in the census\" and that \"other\n\ngroups, such as nonresident students, are statistically\n\ninsignificant and cannot be easily placed in specific census\n\nblocks.\"   The 1991 Reapportionment Commission thereupon decided\n\nto exclude, from the permanent resident population base,\n\nnonresident military personnel and their dependents as\n\nconstituting \"the vast majority of transients included in the\n\ncensus counts.\"   It stated, in its final reapportionment plan,\n\nthat \"exclusion of nonresident military from the census data will\n\ncome as close as possible to the desired permanent resident base\n\nfor legislative reapportionment\" because: (1) nonresident\n\nmilitary then constituted about 114,000 or 14% of Hawaii's\n\npopulation; (2) most military personnel considered Hawai#i a\n\ntemporary home and only 3% opted to become Hawai#i citizens; and\n\n(3) 98% of military dependents claimed the same residency as the\n\nmilitary member of the family.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f          The 1991 Reapportionment Commission's final\n\nreapportionment plan was the basis, in the 1992 legislative\n\nsession, for House Bill 2327 to amend article IV of the Hawai#i\n\nConstitution to change the state legislature apportionment base\n\nfrom registered voters to permanent resident population \"based on\n\nthe 1991 Reapportionment Commission's Final Reapportionment Plan\"\n\nand \"the reasons set forth in [the] Plan.\"     House Bill 2327 was\n\nenacted by the 1992 legislature and article IV of the Hawai#i\n\nConstitution was amended by Hawai#i voters in 1992 to its present\n\nform.\n\n                             ARTICLE IV\n                           REAPPORTIONMENT\n          . . . .\n                APPORTIONMENT AMONG BASIC ISLAND UNITS\n\n               Section 4. The [reapportionment]\n          commission shall allocate the total number of\n          members of each house of the state legislature\n          being reapportioned among the four basic island\n          units, namely: (1) the island of Hawaii, (2) the\n          islands of Maui, Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe,\n          (3) the island of Oahu and all other islands not\n          specifically enumerated, and (4) the islands of\n          Kauai and Niihau, using the total number of\n          permanent residents in each of the basic island\n          units and computed by the method known as the\n          method of equal proportions; except that no basic\n          island unit shall receive less than one member in\n          each house.\n          . . . .\n               APPORTIONMENT WITHIN BASIC ISLAND UNITS\n\n               Section 6.

The Commission was then required, in step two, to\n\napportion the senate and house members within county districts.\n\n           Allocation under step one required the Commission to:\n\n(1) determine the total number of permanent residents in the\n\n                                      23\n\f   ***   FOR PUBLICATION IN W EST'S HAW AI#I REPORTS AND PACIFIC REPORTER   ***\n\nstate; (2) divide the total number of permanent residents by 25\n\nand 51 to determine the average number of permanent residents per\n\nmember of each senate and house district; and (3) divide the\n\ntotal number of permanent residents in each county by the average\n\nnumber of permanent residents per member of each senate and house\n\ndistrict.   Such allocation required the Commission, as an initial\n\nstep, to determine the total number of permanent residents in the\n\nstate and in each county.\n\n            Determining the total number of permanent residents in\n\nthe state and in each county required the Commission, in step\n\none, to extract non-permanent military residents and non-\n\npermanent university student residents from the state's and the\n\ncounties' 2010 Census population.          Apportioning the senate and\n\nhouse members among nearly equal numbers of permanent residents\n\nrequired the Commission, in step two, to identify the specific\n\nlocations of non-permanent military residents and non-permanent\n\nuniversity student residents.\n\n            The Commission acknowledged a 2010 statewide population\n\nof at least 62,545 out-of-state university students and active\n\nduty military who declare Hawai#i not to be their home state.\n\nThe Commission further acknowledged a 2010 statewide population\n\nof 58,949 military dependents, the majority of whom are\n\npresumably the dependents of 47,082 active duty military -- out\n\nof 48,015 active duty military -- who declare Hawai#i not to be\n\ntheir home state.

Identification\n\nof the residence addresses for the non-permanent residents was\n\nnecessary for apportionment of the senate and house members\n\nwithin the county districts under step two, but was not necessary\n\nfor allocation of the senate and house members among the four\n\ncounties under step one.\n\n            The Commission's data identified, by zip codes, the\n\n47,082 active duty military who declare Hawai#i not to be their\n\nhome state and the 58,949 military dependents.             The data\n\nidentified 3,203 out-of-state students at Hawaii Pacific\n\nUniversity, 627 out-of-state students at Brigham Young\n\nUniversity, 1,140 out-of-state students at Chaminade University,\n\nand 10,493 out-of-state students at the University of Hawaii (UH)\n\nManoa and Hilo.

The Commission also had data to determine -- by the\n\nsite of Hawaii's universities -- the non-permanent student\n\nresident populations of each of the counties.

Solomon also identified for the\n\nCommission the 1,233 out-of-state students in Hawai#i County at\n\nUH-Hilo.   The Commission rejected Solomon's method of identifying\n\nthe non-permanent resident population of Hawai#i County and\n\nidentified and excluded only 793 residents from Hawai#i County's\n\npermanent population.\n\n           The Commission contends that it apportioned the state\n\nlegislature in accordance with article IV, section 4 because it\n\nexcluded, from the counties' permanent resident populations, only\n\nnon-permanent residents identifiable to particular census blocks.\n\nHowever, HRS \u00a7 25-2(a) requires the Commission to apportion the\n\nstate legislature on the \"basis, method and criteria\" prescribed\n\nby article IV, which provides, in section 4, for apportionment\n\n\"using the total number of permanent residents in each of the\n\nbasic island units.\"      Nothing in article IV, section 4 requires\n\napportionment based on the total number of permanent residents\n\nidentified by census block.        The 1991 Reapportionment Commission\n\nused census blocks to identify, count and locate non-permanent\n\nresidents, but such method of determining the permanent resident\n\npopulation base was not incorporated in article IV, section 4.\n\n           The Commission's method of apportioning the state\n\nlegislature did not properly separate the step one process of\n\nallocating the legislative members among the four counties from\n\nthe step two process of apportioning the members within county\n\ndistricts.

The Commission\n\nacknowledged at oral argument that it did not differentiate the\n\nstep one process from the step two process.\n\n           The Commission's military data, university data and\n\ncensus data on the state's non-permanent residents identified,\n\nfor step one, the resident counties for over 100,000 non-\n\npermanent residents, but identified, for step two, the residence\n\naddresses for only 16,458 non-permanent residents.              The\n\nCommission undertook its reapportionment task by focusing solely\n\non identification of non-permanent residents for step two and\n\nusing the results for step two to identify the non-permanent\n\nresident population for step one.          The result is a Final\n\nReapportionment Plan that includes -- in the population base that\n\nthe Commission used to allocate the 25 members of the senate and\n\n51 members of the house of representatives among the basic island\n\nunits -- at least 45,996 non-permanent university student\n\nresidents and non-permanent active duty military residents, as\n\nwell as thousands of other non-permanent residents who are the\n\ndependents of the 47,082 non-permanent active duty military\n\nresidents.

The\n\nCommission undertook its reapportionment task by focusing solely\n\non identification of non-permanent residents for step two and\n\nusing the results for step two to identify the non-permanent\n\nresident population for step one.
