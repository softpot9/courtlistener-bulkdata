Therefore the following material averments in the replication are not proven, to wit:</p>\n<p>\"The said Will Steele and the said Windham jointly executed to the plaintiff their certain chattel mortgage, conveying to the plaintiff all the crops raised or to be raised by the said Will Steele and family during the year 1914, * * * and that by reason of the execution of said mortgage of February 12, 1914, the legal title of said cotton was conveyed to the plaintiff by the said Windham and Steele,\" etc., and the plaintiff must fail.</p>\n<p>This being an action for the conversion of chattels, involving the single question as to whether the plaintiff had such title to the chattels as entitled him to sue for its conversion, all the facts pertaining to this issue were admissible under the general issue.
