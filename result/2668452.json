White, brings this action against her fonner employer,\n\nTimothy F. Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury,l alleging discrimination on the basis of\n\nrace, sex, pregnancy, and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964,42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5, and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978,42 U.S.C. \u00a7\n\n2000e(k). The Secretary filed a motion for partial dismissal alleging White failed to\n\nexhaust her administrative remedies for her pregnancy-discrimination claim. The Court\n\nagrees and GRANTS the Secretary's motion.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n        White was a human resources coordinator at the Office of the Comptroller of the\n\nCurrency at the Department of the Treasury from May 2000 until May 2007. (Compi. at\n\n\n        lPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), if a public officer named as a party to\nan action in his official capacity ceases to hold office, the court will automatically substitute that\nofficer's successor. Accordingly, the Court substitutes Timothy F. Geithner for Henry M.\nPaulson, Jr.\n\f1-2.) She alleges that when she returned from maternity leave on October 3,2005, her\n\nbelongings had been packed up and she was stripped of both her responsibilities and her\n\nwork station. Eight days later, on October 11,2005, White met with the agency's EEO\n\nrepresentative, Laurie Cymbor (Cymbor), to discuss this tum of events. Cymbor\n\nexplained to White that if she felt she was being discriminated against, she could file an\n\ninformal EEO complaint within 45 days of the alleged discrimination or she could\n\nparticipate in the agency's alternative dispute resolution program. White further alleges\n\nthat Cymbor explained that if she participated in the alternative dispute resolution\n\nprogram, she could later file an EEO complaint. (PI. Opp. at 3.)\n\n       Indeed, White's notes, taken the same day, do indicate White believed pursuing\n\nmediation would not preclude her from later pursuing an EEO claim. (PI. Ex. 4 at ~ 9 & PI.\n\nEx. 3.) The notes do not, however, indicate Cymbor told White she could pursue\n\nmediation and later pursue an EEO claim if she had not filed within the 45-day deadline.\n\nAdditionally, White offers a journal entry indicating that she understood that by\n\ncontacting EEO she was beginning a process of alleging discrimination that could result\n\nin a lawsuit. (PI. Opp. at 10; PI. Ex. 4.)\n\n       In any event, when White alternatively chose to participate in the agency's dispute\n\nresolution program, she received a memorandum stating that she could also pursue \"an\n\ninformal complaint or grievance, provided that [sheJ initiate an action within the\n\nappropriate time/rame.\" (Def. Ex. 4 at 1 (emphasis added).) The mediation agreement\n\n\n                                             2\n\falso stated White must request EEO counseling within 45 calendar days of the alleged\n\ndiscrimination. Indeed, White placed her initials next to this paragraph in the mediation\n\nagreement. (Def. Ex. 6 at 3.) See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 I6I4.105(a)(l) (establishing the 45-day\n\ndeadline).\n\n       After an unsuccessful mediation, White filed an informal EEO complaint on\n\nDecember 16,2005, (see Def. Ex.II at 1), almost one month after the 45-day deadline to\n\nfile a complaint for discrimination based on the incidents of October 3, 2005. White filed\n\na formal EEO complaint of discrimination on March 7, 2006, in which she alleged\n\ndiscrimination on multiple grounds, including pregnancy discrimination based on the\n\nactions of October 3,2005. (Def. Ex. 6.) In a letter, the agency agreed to investigate\n\nsome of White's discrimination claims, but dismissed her pregnancy-based claim for a\n\nfailure to file within the deadline. 2 (Def. Ex. 7 at 1-2.) On March 3,2008, White filed\n\nthe instant suit in this Court alleging discrimination on the basis of race, disability, sex,\n\npregnancy, and retaliation. 3 (See CompI.)\n\n\n\n\n        2The agency further explained in the letter that the alleged pregnancy discrimination\noccurred on October 3, 2005, and that White elected to use the agency's mediation process\nbefore initiating counseling on December 16,2005. (Def. Ex. 7 at 2.) The agency also explained\nWhite was aware of the deadlines, as indicated by her signing of the agency's form stipulating\nthe specific time frames for initiating EEO counseling and filing an administrative grievance.\n(ld.)\n\n       3The agency's motion involves only White's pregnancy-discrimination claim. Therefore,\nthe Court does not address White's other claims. (Def.' s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 1.)\n\n                                               3\n\f                                         ANALYSIS\n\n       A plaintiff must have exhausted her administrative remedies, including the timely\n\nfiling of an EEO complaint, in order to survive a motion to dismiss. See Gillet v. King,\n\n931 F. Supp. 9,12 (D.D.C. 1996) (\"It is axiomatic that a plaintiff must exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies prior to instituting a Title VII judicial action against a federal\n\nagency.\"); Bowden v. United States, 106 F. 3d 433,437 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (\"Complainants\n\nmust timely exhaust ... administrative remedies before bringing their claims to court.\").\n\nAlthough White admits she filed her informal EEO complaint papers more than 45 days\n\nafter the alleged discriminatory action, she alleges that equitable estoppel should apply to\n\ntoll the statute of limitations period because \"alleged affirmative misconduct\" by an\n\nagency official misled her about the running of the limitations period. 4 How so?\n\n\n\n        4White also offers a related argument. She asserts she filed her informal EEO complaint\nthrough her meeting with Cymbor on October 11, 2005. (PI.'s Opp. at 7-8.) She notes that\nbeginning the EEO process does not require filing the paperwork of an informal complaint, but\nonly that the employee \"(1) contact an agency official 'logically connected' with the EEO process\n... and (2) demonstrate an intent to begin the EEO process.\" Klugel v.

She asserts she demonstrated an intent to begin the process within the 45-\nday time frame, during her meeting with Cymbor on October 11,2005.\n        This argument also fails, however, as White understood during this meeting that the\nmediation process was separate and distinct from the EEO process. As White herself explained\nin her opposition, \"[a]ccording to [White's] notes of the conversation, which she prepared the\nsame day, Ms. Cymbor advised her that she had two choices: file and informal EEO complaint\nwithin 45 days, or participate in the Defendant's ADR program.\" (PI. 's Opp. at 3.) Indeed, she\ngoes on to explain that she understood she was choosing between the mediation and filing an\ninformal EEO complaint. (ld.) By her own admissions and arguments, White makes it clear she\nknew the mediation process and the EEO process were different and she knew she was electing\nto pursue mediation rather than the EEO process. Therefore, the uncontroverted evidence does\nnot support White's assertion that she intended to begin the EEO process during her meeting\nwith CymboL\n\n                                               4\n\f       Equitable estoppel-not surprisingly-is a \"high\" \"hurdle\" to clear.

White has not done so here!\n\n       To the contrary, the evidence does not establish White was misled about the\n\nrunning of the statute of limitations. White has offered evidence sufficient to establish\n\nonly that Cymbor told her pursuing mediation does not foreclose a later EEO action.\n\nEven assuming this, as the Court must, 5 White has failed to provide any evidence to\n\n\n         5As the agency moves to dismiss for failure to exhaust, the Court construes the complaint\nin the light most favorable to White and accepts all the complaint's factual allegations as true.\n\n                                                5\n\festablish her general assertion that Cymbor told her she could file an EEO complaint\n\noutside the 45-day filing period. In light of the fact that the agency explicitly informed\n\nWhite of the deadline in two separate documents, White needed to provide some evidence\n\nthat Cymbor contradicted the documents by telling her she could pursue an EEO\n\ncomplaint regardless of whether she filed it within the 45-day filing period. See Hewitt v.\n\nRice, 560 F. Supp. 2d 61,65 (D.D.C. 2008) (declining to apply equitable tolling when the\n\nplaintiff alleged his employer gave him 'misinformation,' because the evidence did not\n\nbear this out). The plaintiff having failed to do so, the Court cannot now find the agency\n\nmisled her about the running of the limitations period, and equitable estoppel does not\n\napply.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the agency's motion for partial\n\ndismissal.

In light of the fact that the agency explicitly informed\n\nWhite of the deadline in two separate documents, White needed to provide some evidence\n\nthat Cymbor contradicted the documents by telling her she could pursue an EEO\n\ncomplaint regardless of whether she filed it within the 45-day filing period. See Hewitt v.\n\nRice, 560 F. Supp. 2d 61,65 (D.D.C. 2008) (declining to apply equitable tolling when the\n\nplaintiff alleged his employer gave him 'misinformation,' because the evidence did not\n\nbear this out). The plaintiff having failed to do so, the Court cannot now find the agency\n\nmisled her about the running of the limitations period, and equitable estoppel does not\n\napply.\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS the agency's motion for partial\n\ndismissal. An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is attached hereto.\n\n\n\n         SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n                                                  United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\nMartinez v. United States, 587 F. Supp. 2d 245, 247 (DD.C. 2008).\n\n                                              6\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "74f90dbfc56eb40d8894d6dbc90fed4fdddbc35f", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "District Court, District of Columbia", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1427353/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1753343/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2014-04-04T15:13:27.153448Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 6, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/2668452/white-v-paulson/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "2668452", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "White v.
