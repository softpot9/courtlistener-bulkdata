United States", "PartyType1": "", "Document_Level_Tags": ["ScrapeSource_CL", "ScrapeDate_06202018"], "Case_Text": "In the\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\n\nNo. 00-2411\n\nKaren Jutzi-Johnson, as administrator of the\nestate of Robert Johnson, deceased,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\n\nv.\nUnited States of America,\n\nDefendant-Appellant.\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.\nNo. 96 C 5708--Charles P. Kocoras, Judge.\n\nArgued January 23, 2001--Decided September 4, 2001\n\n\n\n  Before Posner, Easterbrook, and Ripple,\nCircuit Judges.\n\n  Posner, Circuit Judge. Robert Johnson\nhanged himself in his cell in the\nMetropolitan Correctional Center, the\nfederal jail in Chicago, where he had been\nheld for six months awaiting trial for\nextortion. His estate brought this suit for\ndamages against the United States under the\nFederal Torts Claim Act, 28 U.S.C. sec.sec.\n1346(b), 2671-80, charging that the jail\nwas negligent in failing to identify him\nas a suicide risk and take suitable\npreventive measures. The Act incorporates\nlocal law, id., sec. 1346(b), and so the\nquestion is the liability of the United\nStates under the principles of Illinois\ntort law, though so far as bears on issues\nof liability in this case they are the\ngeneral principles of Anglo-American tort\nlaw, not anything special to Illinois.\n\n  The district judge, after a bench trial,\nawarded the estate $1.8 million in damages,\nof which $1.6 million was intended to\ncompensate for the pain and suffering that\nJohnson suffered during the period of\nseveral minutes in which he remained alive\nbefore strangling while hanging from the\nnoose that he had made out of a bedsheet\nand suspended from an exposed pipe that\nran beneath the ceiling of his cell. The\nother $200,000 in damages were for the\nloss to his family resulting from his\n\fdeath.\n\n  Although the initial psychological\nscreening that Johnson like all new inmates\nunderwent revealed no history of\npsychiatric disorders or suicide attempts\nand no suicidal thoughts, and although this\nwas not his first spell of incarceration,\nhe deteriorated markedly during his stay in\nthe jail. He scratched and picked at sores\non his body until they bled so copiously\nthat they stained his clothes and bedsheets\nand were noticed by other inmates. One of\nthe guards observed that Johnson was a\nloner, slept a lot during the day, seemed\nnervous, had poor hygiene, and had a lot\nof sores that bled; yet the guard did not\nthink to refer Johnson to the medical or\npsychology department of the jail. Another\ninmate told at least one other member of\nthe prison staff that Johnson had a\nnervous problem and might need an\nantidepressant, but nothing was done about\nthis information either. The day before\nJohnson killed himself his cellmate\nimportuned him to see a physician\u2019s\nassistant and filled out a sick-call form\nin which the cellmate stated: \"Open sores\nall over body caused from nerves. Request\nto see a psychologist or psychiatrist.\"\nJohnson presented the form to the\nphysician\u2019s assistant the next day, but she\nneglected to read it and when he told her\nhis roommate was taking some kind of\nmedication that he thought he should be\ntaking as well she merely told him to make\nan appointment to see the jail\npsychologist. He did not do that, but\ninstead hanged himself 12 hours later.\n\n  The government does not deny that the\njail\u2019s staff was negligent in failing to\ndiscover that Johnson had some kind of\nnervous condition and to take steps to\ndeal with it. The obsessive scratching and\npicking, in the context of a general\npattern of abnormal behavior, should have\nalerted the staff to the fact that Johnson\nmight have a psychiatric illness. The\nphysician\u2019s assistant whom Johnson\nconsulted should have read the sick-call\nform and had she done so she might well\nhave sent him directly to the jail\npsychologist rather than relying on him to\nmake an appointment to see the\npsychologist. But it was the plaintiff\u2019s\nburden to prove both that Johnson would\nnot have committed suicide had the jail\u2019s\nstaff acted responsibly, e.g., Beul v. ASSE\nInt\u2019l, Inc., 233 F.3d 441, 445-47 (7th\n\fCir. 2000); Merco Distributing Corp.\nv.Commercial Police Alarm Co., 267 N.W.2d\n652 (Wis. 1978); Guthrie v. American\nProtection Industries, 206 Cal. Rptr. 834,\n836 (Cal. App. 1984); Vastola v.\nConnecticut Protective System, Inc., 47\nA.2d 844, 845 (Conn. 1946), and that his\nsuicide was a foreseeable as well as\nactual consequence of the staff\u2019s\nnegligence.\n\n  The issue of causation is doctrinally\nstraightforward; not so the issue of the\nforeseeability of suicide. When failure to\nprevent a suicide is claimed to be\nnegligent, the issue of foreseeability is\nanalyzed under the rubric of \"supervening\ncause\" and the general rule is that the\nnegligent actor is not liable for the\nvictim\u2019s decision to kill himself. The\nsuicide is said to be a supervening cause\nof the victim\u2019s loss of his life, breaking\nthe chain of responsibility that would\notherwise link the loss to the negligent\nact. E.g., Beul v. ASSE Int\u2019l, Inc.,\nsupra, 233 F.3d at 447; McMahon v. St.\nCroix Falls School District, 596 N.W.2d\n875, 879 (Wis. App. 1999); Wyke v. Polk\nCounty School Board, 129 F.3d 560, 574-75\n(11th Cir. 1997); Bruzga v. PMR Architects,\nP.C., 693 A.2d 401 (N.H. 1997); Edwards v.\nTardif, 692 A.2d 1266, 1269 (Conn. 1997);\nW. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton\non the Law of Torts sec. 44, p. 311 (5th\ned. 1984). Of course this is just a\nconclusion, not reasoning; but it is a\nconclusion sustained by reasoning about the\nunforeseeability of most suicides and the\nrole of foreseeability in determining tort\nliability. If an employer refuses an\nemployee\u2019s request for a raise, the latter\nmay respond by killing himself, and yet\nthe employer even if somehow negligent in\nfailing to give the employee the raise\nwould not be legally responsible for the\ndeath, just as if through the carelessness\nof the driver a truck spilled a toxic\nsubstance and a passerby scraped it up and\npoisoned his mother-in-law with it the\ndriver would not be liable to the mother-\nin-law\u2019s estate; the son-in-law\u2019s criminal\nact would be deemed a supervening cause.\nSee Rowe v. State Bank of Lombard, 531\nN.E.2d 1358, 1361 (Ill. 1988); Giebel v.\nRichards, 591 N.W.2d 901 (Wis. App. 1999);\nHenry v. Merck & Co., 877 F.2d 1489, 1494-\n97 (10th Cir. 1989); Shelton v. Board of\nRegents, 320 N.W.2d 748, 752-53 (Neb.\n1982).\n\f  A person is not liable for such\nimprobable consequences of negligent\nactivity as could hardly figure in his\ndeciding how careful he should be.\nLiability in such circumstances would serve\nno deterrent, no regulatory purpose; it\nwould not alter behavior and increase\nsafety. Nothing would be gained by imposing\nliability in such a case but compensation,\nand compensation can be obtained more\ncheaply by insurance. But by the same\ntoken the doctrine of supervening cause is\nnot applicable when the duty of care\nclaimed to have been violated is precisely\na duty to protect against ordinarily\nunforeseeable conduct. A risk unforeseeable\nto an ordinary person is foreseeable to a\nspecialist who assumes a duty to prevent\nthe risk from materializing. The duty is a\nrecognition that the unforeseeable has\nbecome foreseeable to the relevant\ncommunity. And so a hospital that fails to\nmaintain a careful watch over patients\nknown to be suicidal is not excused by the\ndoctrine of supervening cause from\nliability for a suicide, e.g., DeMontiney\nv. Desert Manor Convalescent Center, 695\nP.2d 255, 259-60 (Ariz. 1985), any more\nthan a zoo can escape liability for\nallowing a tiger to escape and maul people\non the ground that the tiger is the\nsupervening cause of the mauling. City of\nMangum v. Brownlee, 75 P.2d 174 (Okla.\n1938); see also Scorza v. Martinez, 683\nSo. 2d 1115, 1117 (Fla. App. 1996);\nBehrens v. Bertram Mills Circus, Ltd.,\n[1957] 2 Q.B. 1, 1 All E.R. 583 (1957). In\nboth cases there is a foreseeable, in the\nsense of probable, hazard which precautions\ncan and should be taken in order to\nlessen. So we may set the language of\nsupervening cause to one side and ask\nsimply whether Johnson\u2019s suicide was a\nforeseeable consequence of the negligence\nof his jailers in responding ineffectually\nto his abnormal behavior.\n\n  But first we should consider whether\nthere was any causal relation between that\nnegligence and the suicide. We think not.\nJohnson did not commit suicide because he\nhad sores on his body. As nearly as can be\nreconstructed from the evidence, he\ncommitted suicide because he was upset\nabout being in jail, separated from his\nfamily (including a daughter born while he\nwas in jail) and facing a prison term if\nhe was convicted. The scratching and the\nsuicide were the consequences of an\nunderlying unhappiness. Nothing the jail\u2019s\n\fstaff could have done would have alleviated\nJohnson\u2019s concerns about separation and\nimprisonment. They were inherent in his\nsituation. True, had the jail\u2019s\npsychologist interviewed him, Johnson might\nhave expressed suicidal thoughts and in\nthat event the jail would doubtless have\nplaced him on suicide watch and thereby\nprevented him from killing himself. (At\nleast it would have moved him out of a\ncell that, because of the exposed pipe\nnear the ceiling, made it easy for an\ninmate to hang himself.) \"Might\" is the\noperative word. Johnson had no history of\npsychiatric illness and had not revealed\nany suicidal ideation at his intake exam.\nUntil nudged by his roommate to visit the\nphysician\u2019s assistant he had made no effort\nto contact the medical (including\npsychiatric) personnel of the jail. It is\nsheer conjecture that an interview with the\njail psychologist would have produced\nsufficient information to have enabled the\npsychologist to infer that Johnson was a\nsuicide risk and place him on suicide\nwatch. The psychologist would have noticed\nJohnson\u2019s sores--would even, we may assume,\nhave pronounced him or his behavior\nbizarre. But bizarre behavior and suicidal\nbehavior are different, and there is no\nevidence that suicidal tendencies can be\ninferred from the kind of behavior that\nJohnson exhibited.\n\n  It is true that jail inmates are much\nmore likely to commit suicide than free\npersons are--in fact, nine times as likely.\nLindsay M. Hayes & Joseph R. Rowan,\nNational Study of Jail Suicides: Seven\nYears Later 54 (National Center on\nInstitutions and Alternatives, Feb. 1988).\nAccording to the study just cited (the\nonly one we have found), 12.9 percent of\njail suicides occur within the first three\nhours of confinement, 32.8 percent within\nthe first 24 hours, 62.1 percent within\nthe first two weeks, 72.8 percent within\nthe first month, 89.2 within the first\nfour months, and 97.4 within the first\nseven months. The likelihood of suicide is\nhighest between 2 and 14 days of\nconfinement, and only 10.8 percent of\nsuicides occur after 5 months. Id. at 36.\nThus, when Johnson was in his worst\npsychological state, after 5 months of\nbeing in jail, the statistical likelihood\nof suicide was diminishing rapidly. No\nevidence has been offered that a prisoner\nwho has no history of suicide attempts or\neven suicidal thoughts should be considered\n\fa suicide risk merely because, months after\nhis imprisonment began, he displays\nsymptoms of a possible psychiatric\ndisturbance.\n\n  If the jail psychologist would not have\ndiagnosed Johnson as suicidal, there is no\nreason to believe that his suicide would\nhave been averted. It is here that the\nanalysis of causality and the analysis of\nforeseeability, though distinct (the issue\nof foreseeability does not arise until the\ndefendant\u2019s negligent act is identified as\na cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury), blend\ninsensibly into each other. The reason that\nmeasures to prevent Johnson\u2019s suicide\nprobably would not have been taken even if\nthe jail\u2019s staff had been exercising due\ncare is that the suicide was not a\nforeseeable consequence of Johnson\u2019s\nbehavior. The population of prisons and\njails is not a random sample of American\ncitizens. It is largely a subset of the\ncriminal population (not entirely, since\nsome pretrial detainees are innocent of the\ncrimes for which they are awaiting trial),\nitself a population prone to\nabnormalbehavior, and the conditions of\nincarceration place the prisoners under\nconsiderable psychological strain. Abnormal\nbehavior in jails and prisons is therefore\ncommon. Whether such behavior connotes a\nsubstantially enhanced suicide risk after\nthe first few days or weeks or months of\nincarceration is a question on which the\nrecord of this case, including the expert\nevidence, casts no light. Had Johnson\ndeveloped infections from his obsessive\npicking and scratching, the government\nmight well be liable; for infection is a\nforeseeable result of that behavior.\nSuicide, so far as the record shows, is\nnot.\n\n  The psychiatric condition most closely\nassociated with suicide is severe\n(\"clinical\") depression, and a disturbed\nsleep pattern is a symptom of depression.\nBut of course many people who sleep badly\nare not depressed, and most people who are\ndepressed do not commit suicide. No\nevidence was presented that compulsive\nscratching is a symptom of depression. Had\nthe staff been more alert, maybe they\nwould have stumbled on some underlying\npsychiatric condition predictive of\nsuicide. But maybe not, because no one\nknows whether Johnson committed suicide\nbecause he was depressed or because he\ncould not stand the prospect of\n\fimprisonment--as the district judge well\nunderstood. He asked \"why did Bob Johnson\ntake his own life\" and answered that \"the\nevidence presented some reasons but does\nnot establish any of them with certainty.\nWhile an official declaration by this Court\nmight be useful in trying to come to grips\nwith this human tragedy, no explanation\nwill be offered because it would\nnecessarily be dependent upon an\ninappropriate degree of speculation.\"\nPrecisely. The judge should have ended his\nopinion there. Since no one knows why\nJohnson killed himself, there is no basis\nfor thinking that due care by the staff\nwould have prevented him from doing so (by\ndetecting the risk and, as a consequence,\nplacing him on suicide watch), or that the\nstaff should have foreseen that suicide\nwould be a likely result of its\nbeingcareless.\n\n  Although our analysis makes it\nunnecessary to consider the government\u2019s\nobjection to the size of the award of dam\nages for pain and suffering, we shall\naddress that objection in an effort to\nprovide some guidance for future cases. The\njudge awarded the plaintiff $1.6 million\nfor Johnson\u2019s pain and suffering without\nany explanation of how he had arrived at\nthis amount, apart from noting that \"there\nis no dispute that Bob Johnson did not die\ninstantly.\" Juries do not explain their\nreasoning process, but Fed. R. Civ. P.\n52(a) requires judges, when they are the\ntriers of fact, to make written findings\nin support of their conclusions. This\nmeans, when the issue is the amount of\ndamages, that the judge must indicate the\nreasoning process that connects the\nevidence to the conclusion, here the\nevidence that Johnson may have remained\nconscious for anywhere from three to twenty\nminutes while hanging and the conclusion\nthat his estate should receive $1.6 million\nfor his pain and suffering. The judge\nshould have determined what the best esti\nmate of the amount of time that Johnson\nremained conscious was and explained why\n(supposing it was four minutes) an award\nof $400,000 for each minute of pain and\nsuffering is appropriate. He did neither.\n\n  Awarding any amount of damages for pain\nand suffering has long been criticized as\nrequiring the trier of fact to monetize a\nloss that is incommensurable with any\nmonetary measure. We do not agree with the\ncriticism. Pain and suffering are perceived\n\fas costs, in the sense of adversities that\none would pay to be spared, by the people\nwho experience them. Unless tortfeasors are\nmade to bear these costs, the cost of\nbeing adjudged careless will fall and so\nthere will be more accidents and therefore\nmore pain and suffering. The problem of\nfiguring out how to value pain and\nsuffering is acute, however. Various\nsolutions, none wholly satisfactory, have\nbeen suggested, such as asking the trier\nof fact, whether jurors or judge, to\nimagine how much they would pay to avoid\nthe kind of pain and suffering that the\nvictim of the defendant\u2019s negligence\nexperienced or how much they would demand\nto experience it willingly, 2 Dan B.\nDobbs, Dobbs Law of Remedies: Damages-\nEquity-Restitution sec. 8.1(4), p. 383 (2d\ned. 1993); or to estimate how much it\nwould cost the victim (if he survived) to\nobtain counseling or therapy to minimize\nthe pain and suffering, Law Commission,\nDamages for Personal Injury: Non-Pecuniary\nLoss 8 (Consultation Paper No. 140, 1995);\nAndrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd.,\n(1978) 83 D.L.R. (3d) 452, 476-77 (Can. S.\nCt.), or how much they would demand to\nassume the risk of the pain and suffering\nthat the victim experienced. Mark\nGeistfeld, \"Placing a Price on Pain and\nSuffering: A Method for Helping Juries\nDetermine Tort Damages for Nonmonetary\nInjuries,\" 83 Cal. L. Rev. 773, 818-28\n(1995). If they said they would demand\n$1,000 to assume a .01 risk of such a\nmisfortune, this would imply that the\nvictim should receive an award of $100,000,\nas that is the judgment that, if\nanticipated, would have induced the\ndefendant to spend up to $1,000 to\nprevent. Talk is cheap, though; and maybe\na better approach would be to present the\njury with evidence of how potential victims\nthemselves evaluate such risks, an approach\nthat has been used to infer the value of\nlife from people\u2019s behavior in using safety\ndevices such as automobile seatbelts or in\ndemanding risk premiums to work at\nhazardous jobs. See, e.g., Richard Thaler\n& Sherwin Rosen, \"The Value of Saving a\nLife: Evidence from the Labor Market,\" in\nHousehold Production and Consumption 265\n(Nestor E. Terleckyj ed. 1975); W. Kip\nViscusi, \"The Value of Risks to Life and\nHealth,\" 31 J. Econ. Lit. 1912 (1992);\nPaul Lanoie, Carmen Pedro & Robert Latour,\n\"The Value of a Statistical Life: A\nComparison of Two Approaches,\" 10 J. Risk\n& Uncertainty 235 (1995).\n\f  Most courts do not follow any of these\napproaches. Instead they treat the\ndetermination of how much damages for pain\nand suffering to award as a standardless,\nunguided exercise of discretion by the\ntrier of fact, reviewable for abuse of\ndiscretion pursuant to no standard to guide\nthe reviewing court either. To minimize the\narbitrary variance in awards bound to\nresult from such a throw-up-the-hands\napproach, the trier of fact should, as is\ndone routinely in England, J. Munkman,\nDamages for Personal Injury and Death 162-\n63 (7th ed. 1985); Law Commission, supra,\nat 19-22, be informed of the amounts of\npain and suffering damages awarded in\nsimilar cases. See, e.g., Johnson v. Rogers\n& Phillips, Inc., 753 So. 2d 286, 295 (La.\nApp. 1999); Oscar G. Chase, \"Helping Jurors\nDetermine Pain and Suffering Awards,\" in\nReforming the Civil Justice System 340\n(Larry Kramer ed. 1996); James F.\nBlumstein, Randall R. Bovbjerg & Frank A.\nSloan, \"Beyond Tort Reform: Developing\nBetter Tools for Assessing Damages for\nPersonal Injury,\" 8 Yale J. Reg. 171, 184-\n85 (1991). And when the trier of fact is a\njudge, he should be required as part of\nhis Rule 52(a) obligation to set forth in\nhis opinion the damages awards that he\nconsidered comparable. We make such\ncomparisons routinely in reviewing pain and\nsuffering awards, see, e.g., Tullis v.\nTownley Engineering & Mfg. Co., 243 F.3d\n1058, 1066 (7th Cir. 2001); Riemer v.\nIllinois Dept. of Transportation, 148 F.3d\n800, 808 (7th Cir. 1998); DeBiasio v.\nIllinois Central R.R., 52 F.3d 678, 689\n(7th Cir. 1995), as do other courts. See,\ne.g., Smith v. KMart Corp., 177 F.3d 19,\n31-32 (1st Cir. 1999); Mathie v. Fries,\n121 F.3d 808, 813-14 (2d Cir. 1997);\nWilliams v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 875 F.2d\n501, 506 (5th Cir. 1989). It would be a\nwise practice to follow at the trial level\nas well.\n\n  But can we prescribe it in a case such as\nthis where the rule of decision is state\nrather than federal? The Supreme Court has\nheld that a rule requiring uniformity in\ndamages awards is, like a cap on damages,\nsee Knowles v. United States, 91 F.3d\n1147, 1150 (8th Cir. 1996); Aguilar v.\nUnited States, 920 F.2d 1475, 1478 (9th\nCir. 1990); Reilly v. United States, 863\nF.2d 149, 161 (1st Cir. 1988), substantive\nwithin the meaning of the Erie doctrine.\nGasperini v. Center for Humanities, Inc.,\n\f518 U.S. 415, 428-31 (1996). But the Erie\ndoctrine, a limitation on federal judicial\nintervention in disputes that arise under\nstate law, is not directly applicable to a\nsuit against the United States. Here state\nlaw is being borrowed only because there\nis no well developed body of federal\ncommon law concerning the common torts such\nas negligence, not because there is a\nstate interest in the outcome of the suit.\nIt is true that Erie was not merely a\nconstitutional decision but also an\ninterpretation of the Rules of Decision\nAct, 28 U.S.C. sec. 1652--but that Act\nprovides only that \"the laws of the\nseveral states . . . shall be regarded as\nrules of decision in civil actions in the\ncourts of the United States, in cases\nwhere they [the laws of the several\nstates] apply\" (emphasis added), and they\ndo not apply, in the sense of govern, the\nconduct of the United States.\n\n  The distinction between borrowing and\napplying state law is perhaps most clearly\nestablished in cases involving the\nborrowing of a state statute of limitations\nfor use in litigation based on a federal\nstatute. See, e.g., West v. Conrail, 481\nU.S. 35, 39 n. 4 (1987); Doe v. Blue Cross\n& Blue Shield United of Wisconsin, 112\nF.3d 869, 873-74 (7th Cir. 1997); McIntosh\nv. Antonino, 71 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir.\n1995); Hemmings v. Barian, 822 F.2d 688,\n689-90 (7th Cir. 1987). As we put it in\nHemmings, \"When a federal court borrows a\nstate statute of limitations for use in\nconnection with a federal statute that does\nnot have its own statute of limitations,\nthe court is not applying state law; it is\napplying federal law. It looks to state\nlaw for guidance. . . . The analysis\nwould, however, be different if Count I\nwere a diversity rather than federal-\nquestion count. For purposes of the Erie\ndoctrine the statute of limitations is\nsubstantive rather than procedural, and the\nfederal court therefore applies state law--\nit doesn\u2019t just borrow it.\" Id.\n\n  Nor is a practice of consulting damages\nawards in comparable cases for purposes of\nfacilitating a more thoughtful,\ndisciplined, and informed award in the\nparticular case the same thing as a rule\nlimiting awards within a range set by\nprevious cases, one understanding of the\nstate law rule involved in Gasperini: an\naward of damages was not to \"deviate\nmaterially\" from awards that had been made\n\fin comparable cases. Nor is it easy to\ncharacterize a practice of not consulting\ncomparable awards as a remedial rule, hence\n\"substantive\" in the Erie sense, rather\nthan as a rule of evidence; or a practice\nof such consultation by a reviewing court\nendeavoring to carry out its duty to\nprevent abuses of discretion in the award\nof damages as anything more than a rule of\nappellate procedure. So on multiple\ngrounds, what indeed appears to be the\nrule in Illinois, that comparable awards\nfor pain and suffering are not to be\nconsidered at either the appellate or the\ntrial stage, see, e.g., Epping v.\nCommonwealth Edison Co., 734 N.E.2d 916,\n918-19 (Ill. App. 2000); Barry v. Owens-\nCorning Fiberglas Corp., 668 N.E.2d 8, 14\n(Ill. App. 1996); Simmons v. University of\nChicago Hospitals & Clinics, 617 N.E.2d\n278, 288 (Ill. App. 1993), does not bind\nus in this case.\n\n  In any event, any argument that we should\nnot look at comparable awards in reviewing\nthe award of pain and suffering damages in\nthis case has been forfeited by the\nplaintiff, who, while citing Epping for the\nproposition stated in her brief that \"not\nall courts agree that comparison of damage\nawards aids in evaluating their propriety,\"\nhas not argued that Illinois forbids such\ncomparisons or that, if it does, its rule\nbinds us. Instead, both parties have cited\nwhat they deem comparable cases. Only their\nnotions of comparability are stunted. The\nplaintiff cites three cases in which\ndamages for pain and suffering ranging from\n$600,000 to $1 million were awarded, but\nin each one the pain and suffering\ncontinued for hours, not minutes. The\ndefendant confined its search for\ncomparable cases to other prison suicide\ncases, implying that prisoners experience\npain and suffering differently from other\npersons, so that it makes more sense to\ncompare Johnson\u2019s pain and suffering to\nthat of a prisoner who suffered a\ntoothache than to that of a free person\nwho was strangled, and concluding absurdly\nthat any award for pain and suffering in\nthis case that exceeded $5,000 would be\nexcessive. The parties should have looked\nat awards in other cases involving\nasphyxiation, for example cases of\ndrowning, which are numerous. See, e.g.,\nMillman v. County of Butler, 504 N.W.2d\n820, 826 (Neb. 1993); Snyder v. Whittaker\nCorp., 839 F.2d 1085, 1092-93 (5th Cir.\n1988); Dontas v. City of New York, 584\n\fN.Y.S.2d 134 (App. Div. 1992) (per curiam);\nTurner v. Parish of Jefferson, 721 So. 2d\n64, 76-78 (La. Ct. App. 1999); Stissi v.\nInterstate & Ocean Transport Co., 590 F.\nSupp. 1043, 1048-49 (E.D.N.Y. 1984), aff\u2019d\nin relevant part, 765 F.2d 370, 377 (2d\nCir. 1985). Had they done so, they would\nhave come up with an award in the range of\n$15,000 to $150,000.\n\n  There is more wrong with the award. The\n$1.6 million awarded by the judge was far\nhigher than the amount requested by the\nplaintiff (which was $300,000 to $600,000)\nand came after the judge, in accordance\nwith the principle of comparative\nnegligence, had reduced the award on the\nground that Johnson\u2019s own conduct, that is,\nhis hanging himself, required his estate to\nbear some of the responsibility for the\npain and suffering that the hanging\ninflicted on him. The judge did not\nindicate from what level (or by what\npercentage) he had reduced the award to\n$1.6 million.\n\n  But as we said the plaintiff failed to\nestablish liability. The judgment must\ntherefore be reversed with instructions to\nenter judgment for the government.\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n  RIPPLE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n1.\n\n  On June 7, 1993, Robert Johnson committed\nsuicide by hanging himself from an overhead\npipe using his bedsheet. The facts that\nled up to that tragedy are the basis of\nthis lawsuit.\n\n  An understanding of the issue before us--\nand of the import of the majority\u2019s\nconclusion--will be best understood if the\ncircumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson\u2019s\nsuicide are placed in the broader factual\ncontext of the case.\n\n  Mr. Johnson was arrested and incarcerated\nat Metropolitan Correction Center (\"MCC\")\nin Chicago while awaiting trial on\nextortion charges. During his\nincarceration, Mr. Johnson was first\ndetained on the thirteenth floor, and\nlater, was moved to the seventeenth. By\n\fall accounts, Mr. Johnson was not well on\neither floor. Mr. Johnson was described by\ninmates and guards alike as being a\nnervous and anxious person. Different\ninmates testified that Mr. Johnson did not\neat or sleep well and that his emotional\nwell-being was poor. Inmates alternately\ndescribe Mr. Johnson\u2019s mood as very\nnervous, unstable, and worried. They\ntestified that Mr. Johnson spent a great\ndeal of time by himself and that he became\nless and less social as his incarceration\nprogressed. Mr. Johnson\u2019s last cellmate,\nAlvin McCarver, also testified that during\nthe night, Mr. Johnson would be up\nalternately vomiting and brushing his teeth\nuntil his gums bled./1\n\n  Even more apparent than his general state\nof mind was a disturbing nervous habit\nthat Mr. Johnson acquired. Mr. Johnson\nwould scratch and pick at his skin,\ncausing open sores that would bleed. Once\nhe would cause these sores, Mr. Johnson\nwould continue to pick at them with his\nfingers, manicure scissors, playing cards,\nor apparently anything else that was\navailable. This continual scratching and\npicking caused the sores to fester and\nooze blood; they never properly healed./2\n\n  Several inmates went out of their way to\nhelp Mr. Johnson. Thomas Johnson testified\nthat, a few days prior to Mr. Johnson\u2019s\nsuicide, Johnson had told a guard that he\nthought Mr. Johnson was in need of\npsychiatric care. Jeffery Sorrenson, a\nformer cellmate of Mr. Johnson, testified\nthat he went to a female officer to\ncomplain about Mr. Johnson\u2019s nervous habits\nand hygiene. Derrick Anderson encouraged\nMr. Johnson to see a doctor and even\naccompanied him to sick call on the final\nmorning of Mr. Johnson\u2019s life.\n\n  The efforts of two inmates in particular\nare especially noteworthy. Richard Dover\nmet Mr. Johnson while they both were on\nthe thirteenth floor; Dover also was placed\non the seventeenth floor with Mr. Johnson.\nDover testified that two other inmates and\nhe approached at least three guards in an\nattempt to get medical assistance for Mr.\nJohnson. Dover pointed out Mr. Johnson\u2019s\nsymptoms and said that Mr. Johnson needed\nto go to a hospital. Dover testified that\nnothing came of these conversations: \"We\nalways stayed up onto the guards, trying\nto get them to do something about it, and\nthey never did.\" Dover Dep. at 21.\n\f  Alvin McCarver, Mr. Johnson\u2019s final\ncellmate, also sought help for Mr. Johnson.\nEven though McCarver shared a cell with\nMr. Johnson for only a short time,\nMcCarver already knew of Mr. Johnson\u2019s\nproblems just from living on the same\nfloor. After becoming cellmates, however,\nhis awareness of the problem increased. One\nday, while Mr. Johnson was at an attorney\nvisit, McCarver brought a unit officer into\ntheir cell to see Mr. Johnson\u2019s blood-\nstained sheets./3 McCarver told the\nofficer that \"[s]omething needs to be done\nabout this. This guy needs some help. He\nhas a nervous condition.\" McCarver Dep. at\n27. Because McCarver believed the unit\nofficer had not done anything, McCarver\nthen spoke to Mark Cunneen, a counselor\nassigned to the seventeenth floor. McCarver\ntold Cunneen that Mr. Johnson needed\npsychiatric care and that perhaps\nantidepressant medication was in order.\nMcCarver testified that this meeting\nhappened only days before Mr. Johnson\ncommitted suicide.\n\n  The night before Mr. Johnson\u2019s suicide,\nMcCarver filled out a sick call sheet for\nMr. Johnson. A sick call sheet was a\nrequest to see medical personnel. On the\nsheet, McCarver described Mr. Johnson\u2019s\ncomplaint as open sores caused by nerves.\nIn the box next to the question whether\nthe complaint was serious, McCarver checked\nyes twice. However, when the physician\u2019s\nassistant (\"PA\") saw Mr. Johnson the next\nmorning, she did not have the sick call\nsheet with her, in violation of prison\npolicy.\n\n  Mr. Johnson told the PA that he was\nnervous and that he wanted something to\ncalm him down. Again in violation of\npolicy, the PA told Mr. Johnson to make an\nappointment with a psychologist rather than\nreferring Mr. Johnson personally.\n\n  The compassionate attempts by inmates to\nhelp Mr. Johnson were to little avail.\nThere is no evidence that any prison\nofficial attempted to get Mr. Johnson any\ntype of medical attention. At least one\nprison official testified that he knew of\nMr. Johnson\u2019s problems. Officer James Young\nadmitted that McCarver had confronted him\nabout the blood-stained linens, but he\nnonetheless failed to seek assistance for\nMr. Johnson. Other prison officials claimed\nto have no memory of Mr. Johnson. Cunneen,\n\fthe counselor that McCarver testified he\nspoke to, claimed no recollection either of\nMr. Johnson or of any conversation with\nMcCarver regarding Mr. Johnson. The\ndistrict court found that McCarver\u2019s\ntestimony was \"adamant and precise\" and\nthat Cunneen\u2019s testimony \"strains\ncredulity.\" R.38 at 14.\n\n  Through their combined efforts, inmates\nwere able to cajole Mr. Johnson into\nseeking help for his problems. After months\nof suffering alone, Mr. Johnson went to\nthe PA in hopes of receiving help. When\nthe PA failed to treat Mr. Johnson\nadequately, the last opportunity to help\nMr. Johnson was lost. Twelve hours later,\nMr. Johnson took his own life.\n\n2.\n\n  The majority holds that the United States\ncannot be liable for Mr. Johnson\u2019s death.\nSpecifically, the majority reasons that Mr.\nJohnson\u2019s suicide was not foreseeable and\nthat the Government was not the proximate\ncause of Mr. Johnson\u2019s death. I\nrespectfully disagree.\n\n  \"The district court\u2019s determination of\nforeseeability is a factual determination\nreviewable only for clear error.\" United\nStates v. Bullis, 77 F.3d 1553, 1564 (7th\nCir. 1996). I do not believe that the\ndistrict court clearly erred in its\ndetermination that Mr. Johnson\u2019s suicide\nwas foreseeable. The record offers ample\nevidence that demonstrates that prison\nofficials should have known that Mr.\nJohnson was suffering severe emotional\ndistress. As the district court\nnoted,pretrial detainees like Mr. Johnson\nhave a greater risk of suicide than the\npopulation in general. This reality should\nhave alerted prison officials to scrutinize\nseriously the numerous reports they\nreceived concerning Mr. Johnson\u2019s\ndeteriorating psychiatric state.\n\n  Inmates testified that Mr. Johnson\nbrushed his teeth until they bled, that he\nwas up at nights vomiting, and that he\nscratched his skin until it bled. Mr.\nJohnson was described as a loner who had\nproblems sleeping and eating. On more than\none occasion, inmates such as Alvin\nMcCarver brought these symptoms to the\nattention of prison officials. Prison\nofficials chose to do nothing.\n\f  Undoubtedly, it is easier for officials\nto know that someone is having suicidal\nthoughts when that person says that he is\nhaving suicidal thoughts. However, having\nan inmate in custody creates a duty of\ncare that must include enough attention to\nmental health concerns that inmates with\nobvious symptoms receive medical attention.\nPrison officials had numerous opportunities\nto meet their responsibilities to help Mr.\nJohnson, but no one did. One cannot avoid\nresponsibility by putting one\u2019s head in the\nsand.\n\n3.\n\n  The court reviews factual findings, such\nas the existence of proximate cause, for\nclear error and will not reverse if the\ndistrict court\u2019s findings are plausible in\nlight of the entire record. See Anderson\nv. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573\n(1985); Wyletal v. United States, 907 F.2d\n49, 50 (7th Cir. 1990) (factual findings\nin Federal Tort Act cases reviewed under\nclearly erroneous standard); Susnis v.\nRadfar, 739 N.E.2d 960, 967 (Ill. App. Ct.\n2000) (under Illinois law, questions of\nproximate causation are questions of fact).\n\"A factual determination is clearly\nerroneous only if, after considering all\nthe evidence, the reviewing court is left\nwith the definite and firm conviction that\na mistake has been committed.\" United\nStates v. Charles, 238 F.3d 916, 918 (7th\nCir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). Additionally, \"a\ndistrict court\u2019s choice between two\npermissible inferences from the evidence\ncannot be clearly erroneous.\" See id. Under\nIllinois law, \"proximate cause can only be\nestablished when there is a reasonable\ncertainty that the defendant\u2019s acts caused\nthe injury\" or the increased risk of\nfuture injury. Henderson v. Sheahan, 196\nF.3d 839, 852 (7th Cir. 1999) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n   I cannot join the majority view that the\ndistrict court was clearly erroneous in its\ndetermination that the United States was\nthe proximate cause of Mr. Johnson\u2019s death.\nThe majority correctly notes that suicide\nis generally viewed as a supervening cause\nbreaking the chain of causation. However,\nthere are circumstances that render this\nrule inapplicable. \"As a general rule,\nabsent some type of custodial relationship,\none cannot be held liable for the suicide\nof another.\" Wyke v. Polk County Sch. Bd.,\n\f129 F.3d 560, 574 (11th Cir. 1997). By\narticulating the qualification \"absent some\ntype of custodial relationship,\" our\ncolleagues in the Eleventh Circuit\nacknowledged that the general rule makes no\nsense when a higher duty of care is\nrequired because \"the State \u2019takes a person\ninto its custody and holds him there\nagainst his will,\u2019 hence depriving him of\nliberty.\" Butera v. Dist. of Columbia, 235\nF.3d 637, 648 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Soc.\nServs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989)); see\nalso Bruzga v. PMR Architects, P.C., 693\nA.2d 401, 403 (N.H. 1997). \"[H]aving\nstripped them [incarcerated persons] of\nvirtually every means of self- protection\nand foreclosed their access to outside aid,\nthe government and its officials are not\nfree to let the state of nature take its\ncourse.\" Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n833 (1994).\n\n  Here, prison officials knew that Mr.\nJohnson was suffering severe emotional\ndistress. Given that knowledge, they had an\naffirmative duty to aid Mr. Johnson. Time\nand again, when presented with information\nthat Mr. Johnson was suffering, officials\nfailed to act. The combination of this\ninaction caused Mr. Johnson\u2019s death.\n\n  I believe it to be entirely permissible\nfor the district court to determine that\nthe collective failure of prison officials\nto provide medical assistance for Mr.\nJohnson was the proximate cause of his\ndeath. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s\nconclusion is not clearly erroneous and\nmust be upheld.\n\n4.\n\n  I also cannot join the majority\u2019s\ndiscussion of the damage award in this\ncase. First, the point should be made that\nthe majority concedes that \"our analysis\nmakes it unnecessary\" to consider the\ndamage award in this case. Maj. Op. at 8.\nBecause the discussion of this issue is\nnot necessary to determine the outcome of\nthis case, it is \"purely dicta\" and \"does\nnot constitute the law of the case or any\nother binding precedent for our current\nconsideration.\" Thomas & Betts Corp. v.\nPanduit Corp., 138 F.3d 277, 289 n.4 (7th\nCir. 1998). We have noted that:\n\nDicta are the parts of an opinion that are\nnot binding on a subsequent court, whether\n\fas a matter of stare decisis or as a\nmatter of law of the case. . . . They are\nnon-binding for two reasons. First, not\nbeing integral elements of the analysis\nunderlying the decision . . . they may not\nexpress the judges\u2019 most careful, focused\nthinking. Second, to give the inessential\nparts of an opinion the force of law would\ngive judges too much power, and of an\nessentially legislative character; we could\nhardly consider ourselves judges in the\nAnglo-American tradition were we to\ninterrupt this opinion to offer our\nthoughts.\n\nWilder v. Apfel, 153 F.3d 799, 803 (7th\nCir. 1998).\n\n  The wisdom of this time-honored approach\nto dicta is well-justified by the\nmajority\u2019s expressed view that hanging\ndeaths and death by drowning are\ncomparable. Hanging is an excruciatingly\npainful and cruel way to die. Of the\nforty-eight states that once allowed\nexecutions by hanging, only two\njurisdictions still do. More specifically:\n\nIn properly-performed hangings, the neck\nbreaks immediately and unconsciousness is\nsupposedly instantaneous. However, hanging\nhas been called an \"art,\" and considerable\nskill is necessary to ensure that the neck\nbreaks . . . . In most instances, however,\nthis [break] does not result, and the\ncondemned dies a violent and lingering\ndeath. If the drop is too long, the\nprisoner may be decapitated, causing great\nindignity to the body. If the drop is too\nshort, the inmate may slowly strangle to\ndeath. In strangulation, extreme pain is\nevident: the eyeballs pop out, the tongue\nswells and protrudes, the rope can pull\nhunks of flesh off the face, and the neck\nelongates and distorts. As it is so often\nimproperly performed, the risk of either\ndecapitation or slow strangulation is\nlikely.\n\nKristina E. Beard, Comment, Five Under the\nEighth: Methodology Review and the Cruel\nand Unusual Punishments Clause, 51 U. Miami\nL. Rev. 445, 464 (1997).\n\n  Given that a professional execution, in\nat least a semi-controlled environment,\nleads to an agonizing death, it seems\napparent that a depressed man with only an\noverhead pipe and a bedsheet would suffer\na great deal. Dr. Kern, an ear, nose, and\n\fthroat surgeon, reviewed the documentation\nfor Mr. Johnson\u2019s case and testified as to\nhis findings. Dr. Kern explained that death\nfrom a self-hanging is slower than a\njudicial hanging. Like in Mr. Johnson\u2019s\ncase, the individual usually falls a short\ndistance and uses a material that is\nlooser on the neck than a rope. These\ncircumstances combine to cause a slow\nsuffocation. If a person succeeds in\ncompletely blocking his airway, that person\nmay lose consciousness as quickly as in\nthree minutes. However, Mr. Johnson\n\"assuredly\" could not achieve total airway\nblockage using the bedsheet. Tr.II at 140.\nWhile suffocating, Mr. Johnson experienced\nthe phenomenon known as \"air hunger\" during\nwhich the body wants oxygen but cannot get\nit. Air hunger causes extreme anxiety and\nfear. Dr. Kern testified that it was very\nlikely that Mr. Johnson was conscious\nlonger than three minutes and may have\nsuffered up to twenty.\n\n  Drowning is also clearly a traumatic\nexperience. When a person in the water\nbegins to take water in, the automatic\nphysiological reaction is that the muscle\nat the entrance of the windpipe contracts,\npreventing water from entering the lungs.\nSee Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Encyclopedia of\nMedicine 375 (1989). However, this\ncontraction impairs breathing; without\naccess to oxygen, the brain begins to be\naffected within thirty seconds, and the\nindividual quickly loses consciousness. See\nid.; see also Roy W. Rafter, The Anatomy\nof Drowning, at\nhttp://www.airsearchrescue.com/drowning.h\ntm. Depending on the physical status of\nthe victim, death often occurs in two\nminutes or less.\n\n  The differences between drowning and\nhanging are far too great to cabin the\ndiscretion of the trial court by making\nthe court treat them as one and the same.\nThe standard of review for damage awards\nis still an abuse of discretion.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 Admittedly, these individuals are not experts.\nHowever, when even a lay person recognizes that\nan individual needs help, it does not reflect\nwell on the experts who remain oblivious to the\nsituation.\n\n/2 Although the defendants suggest that this scrat-\nching may have been caused by a skin condition,\n\fthey offer no evidence to support that conten-\ntion. Additionally, at least one inmate, Derrick\nAnderson, testified that Mr. Johnson told him\nthat he scratched because he was nervous, not\nbecause of a skin problem.\n\n/3 MCC policy requires blood-stained linens to be\nlaundered in a particular manner to guard against\nblood-born pathogens.

Kocoras, Judge.\n\nArgued January 23, 2001--Decided September 4, 2001\n\n\n\n  Before Posner, Easterbrook, and Ripple,\nCircuit Judges.\n\n  Posner, Circuit Judge. Robert Johnson\nhanged himself in his cell in the\nMetropolitan Correctional Center, the\nfederal jail in Chicago, where he had been\nheld for six months awaiting trial for\nextortion. His estate brought this suit for\ndamages against the United States under the\nFederal Torts Claim Act, 28 U.S.C. sec.sec.\n1346(b), 2671-80, charging that the jail\nwas negligent in failing to identify him\nas a suicide risk and take suitable\npreventive measures. The Act incorporates\nlocal law, id., sec. 1346(b), and so the\nquestion is the liability of the United\nStates under the principles of Illinois\ntort law, though so far as bears on issues\nof liability in this case they are the\ngeneral principles of Anglo-American tort\nlaw, not anything special to Illinois.\n\n  The district judge, after a bench trial,\nawarded the estate $1.8 million in damages,\nof which $1.6 million was intended to\ncompensate for the pain and suffering that\nJohnson suffered during the period of\nseveral minutes in which he remained alive\nbefore strangling while hanging from the\nnoose that he had made out of a bedsheet\nand suspended from an exposed pipe that\nran beneath the ceiling of his cell. The\nother $200,000 in damages were for the\nloss to his family resulting from his\n\fdeath.\n\n  Although the initial psychological\nscreening that Johnson like all new inmates\nunderwent revealed no history of\npsychiatric disorders or suicide attempts\nand no suicidal thoughts, and although this\nwas not his first spell of incarceration,\nhe deteriorated markedly during his stay in\nthe jail. He scratched and picked at sores\non his body until they bled so copiously\nthat they stained his clothes and bedsheets\nand were noticed by other inmates. One of\nthe guards observed that Johnson was a\nloner, slept a lot during the day, seemed\nnervous, had poor hygiene, and had a lot\nof sores that bled; yet the guard did not\nthink to refer Johnson to the medical or\npsychology department of the jail. Another\ninmate told at least one other member of\nthe prison staff that Johnson had a\nnervous problem and might need an\nantidepressant, but nothing was done about\nthis information either. The day before\nJohnson killed himself his cellmate\nimportuned him to see a physician\u2019s\nassistant and filled out a sick-call form\nin which the cellmate stated: \"Open sores\nall over body caused from nerves. Request\nto see a psychologist or psychiatrist.\"\nJohnson presented the form to the\nphysician\u2019s assistant the next day, but she\nneglected to read it and when he told her\nhis roommate was taking some kind of\nmedication that he thought he should be\ntaking as well she merely told him to make\nan appointment to see the jail\npsychologist. He did not do that, but\ninstead hanged himself 12 hours later.\n\n  The government does not deny that the\njail\u2019s staff was negligent in failing to\ndiscover that Johnson had some kind of\nnervous condition and to take steps to\ndeal with it. The obsessive scratching and\npicking, in the context of a general\npattern of abnormal behavior, should have\nalerted the staff to the fact that Johnson\nmight have a psychiatric illness. The\nphysician\u2019s assistant whom Johnson\nconsulted should have read the sick-call\nform and had she done so she might well\nhave sent him directly to the jail\npsychologist rather than relying on him to\nmake an appointment to see the\npsychologist. But it was the plaintiff\u2019s\nburden to prove both that Johnson would\nnot have committed suicide had the jail\u2019s\nstaff acted responsibly, e.g., Beul v.

If an employer refuses an\nemployee\u2019s request for a raise, the latter\nmay respond by killing himself, and yet\nthe employer even if somehow negligent in\nfailing to give the employee the raise\nwould not be legally responsible for the\ndeath, just as if through the carelessness\nof the driver a truck spilled a toxic\nsubstance and a passerby scraped it up and\npoisoned his mother-in-law with it the\ndriver would not be liable to the mother-\nin-law\u2019s estate; the son-in-law\u2019s criminal\nact would be deemed a supervening cause.\nSee Rowe v.

In\nboth cases there is a foreseeable, in the\nsense of probable, hazard which precautions\ncan and should be taken in order to\nlessen. So we may set the language of\nsupervening cause to one side and ask\nsimply whether Johnson\u2019s suicide was a\nforeseeable consequence of the negligence\nof his jailers in responding ineffectually\nto his abnormal behavior.\n\n  But first we should consider whether\nthere was any causal relation between that\nnegligence and the suicide. We think not.\nJohnson did not commit suicide because he\nhad sores on his body. As nearly as can be\nreconstructed from the evidence, he\ncommitted suicide because he was upset\nabout being in jail, separated from his\nfamily (including a daughter born while he\nwas in jail) and facing a prison term if\nhe was convicted. The scratching and the\nsuicide were the consequences of an\nunderlying unhappiness. Nothing the jail\u2019s\n\fstaff could have done would have alleviated\nJohnson\u2019s concerns about separation and\nimprisonment. They were inherent in his\nsituation. True, had the jail\u2019s\npsychologist interviewed him, Johnson might\nhave expressed suicidal thoughts and in\nthat event the jail would doubtless have\nplaced him on suicide watch and thereby\nprevented him from killing himself. (At\nleast it would have moved him out of a\ncell that, because of the exposed pipe\nnear the ceiling, made it easy for an\ninmate to hang himself.) \"Might\" is the\noperative word. Johnson had no history of\npsychiatric illness and had not revealed\nany suicidal ideation at his intake exam.\nUntil nudged by his roommate to visit the\nphysician\u2019s assistant he had made no effort\nto contact the medical (including\npsychiatric) personnel of the jail. It is\nsheer conjecture that an interview with the\njail psychologist would have produced\nsufficient information to have enabled the\npsychologist to infer that Johnson was a\nsuicide risk and place him on suicide\nwatch. The psychologist would have noticed\nJohnson\u2019s sores--would even, we may assume,\nhave pronounced him or his behavior\nbizarre. But bizarre behavior and suicidal\nbehavior are different, and there is no\nevidence that suicidal tendencies can be\ninferred from the kind of behavior that\nJohnson exhibited.\n\n  It is true that jail inmates are much\nmore likely to commit suicide than free\npersons are--in fact, nine times as likely.\nLindsay M. Hayes & Joseph R. Rowan,\nNational Study of Jail Suicides: Seven\nYears Later 54 (National Center on\nInstitutions and Alternatives, Feb. 1988).\nAccording to the study just cited (the\nonly one we have found), 12.9 percent of\njail suicides occur within the first three\nhours of confinement, 32.8 percent within\nthe first 24 hours, 62.1 percent within\nthe first two weeks, 72.8 percent within\nthe first month, 89.2 within the first\nfour months, and 97.4 within the first\nseven months. The likelihood of suicide is\nhighest between 2 and 14 days of\nconfinement, and only 10.8 percent of\nsuicides occur after 5 months. Id. at 36.\nThus, when Johnson was in his worst\npsychological state, after 5 months of\nbeing in jail, the statistical likelihood\nof suicide was diminishing rapidly. No\nevidence has been offered that a prisoner\nwho has no history of suicide attempts or\neven suicidal thoughts should be considered\n\fa suicide risk merely because, months after\nhis imprisonment began, he displays\nsymptoms of a possible psychiatric\ndisturbance.\n\n  If the jail psychologist would not have\ndiagnosed Johnson as suicidal, there is no\nreason to believe that his suicide would\nhave been averted. It is here that the\nanalysis of causality and the analysis of\nforeseeability, though distinct (the issue\nof foreseeability does not arise until the\ndefendant\u2019s negligent act is identified as\na cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury), blend\ninsensibly into each other. The reason that\nmeasures to prevent Johnson\u2019s suicide\nprobably would not have been taken even if\nthe jail\u2019s staff had been exercising due\ncare is that the suicide was not a\nforeseeable consequence of Johnson\u2019s\nbehavior. The population of prisons and\njails is not a random sample of American\ncitizens. It is largely a subset of the\ncriminal population (not entirely, since\nsome pretrial detainees are innocent of the\ncrimes for which they are awaiting trial),\nitself a population prone to\nabnormalbehavior, and the conditions of\nincarceration place the prisoners under\nconsiderable psychological strain. Abnormal\nbehavior in jails and prisons is therefore\ncommon. Whether such behavior connotes a\nsubstantially enhanced suicide risk after\nthe first few days or weeks or months of\nincarceration is a question on which the\nrecord of this case, including the expert\nevidence, casts no light. Had Johnson\ndeveloped infections from his obsessive\npicking and scratching, the government\nmight well be liable; for infection is a\nforeseeable result of that behavior.\nSuicide, so far as the record shows, is\nnot.\n\n  The psychiatric condition most closely\nassociated with suicide is severe\n(\"clinical\") depression, and a disturbed\nsleep pattern is a symptom of depression.\nBut of course many people who sleep badly\nare not depressed, and most people who are\ndepressed do not commit suicide. No\nevidence was presented that compulsive\nscratching is a symptom of depression. Had\nthe staff been more alert, maybe they\nwould have stumbled on some underlying\npsychiatric condition predictive of\nsuicide. But maybe not, because no one\nknows whether Johnson committed suicide\nbecause he was depressed or because he\ncould not stand the prospect of\n\fimprisonment--as the district judge well\nunderstood. He asked \"why did Bob Johnson\ntake his own life\" and answered that \"the\nevidence presented some reasons but does\nnot establish any of them with certainty.\nWhile an official declaration by this Court\nmight be useful in trying to come to grips\nwith this human tragedy, no explanation\nwill be offered because it would\nnecessarily be dependent upon an\ninappropriate degree of speculation.\"\nPrecisely. The judge should have ended his\nopinion there. Since no one knows why\nJohnson killed himself, there is no basis\nfor thinking that due care by the staff\nwould have prevented him from doing so (by\ndetecting the risk and, as a consequence,\nplacing him on suicide watch), or that the\nstaff should have foreseen that suicide\nwould be a likely result of its\nbeingcareless.\n\n  Although our analysis makes it\nunnecessary to consider the government\u2019s\nobjection to the size of the award of dam\nages for pain and suffering, we shall\naddress that objection in an effort to\nprovide some guidance for future cases. The\njudge awarded the plaintiff $1.6 million\nfor Johnson\u2019s pain and suffering without\nany explanation of how he had arrived at\nthis amount, apart from noting that \"there\nis no dispute that Bob Johnson did not die\ninstantly.\" Juries do not explain their\nreasoning process, but Fed. R. Civ. P.\n52(a) requires judges, when they are the\ntriers of fact, to make written findings\nin support of their conclusions. This\nmeans, when the issue is the amount of\ndamages, that the judge must indicate the\nreasoning process that connects the\nevidence to the conclusion, here the\nevidence that Johnson may have remained\nconscious for anywhere from three to twenty\nminutes while hanging and the conclusion\nthat his estate should receive $1.6 million\nfor his pain and suffering. The judge\nshould have determined what the best esti\nmate of the amount of time that Johnson\nremained conscious was and explained why\n(supposing it was four minutes) an award\nof $400,000 for each minute of pain and\nsuffering is appropriate. He did neither.\n\n  Awarding any amount of damages for pain\nand suffering has long been criticized as\nrequiring the trier of fact to monetize a\nloss that is incommensurable with any\nmonetary measure. We do not agree with the\ncriticism. Pain and suffering are perceived\n\fas costs, in the sense of adversities that\none would pay to be spared, by the people\nwho experience them. Unless tortfeasors are\nmade to bear these costs, the cost of\nbeing adjudged careless will fall and so\nthere will be more accidents and therefore\nmore pain and suffering. The problem of\nfiguring out how to value pain and\nsuffering is acute, however. Various\nsolutions, none wholly satisfactory, have\nbeen suggested, such as asking the trier\nof fact, whether jurors or judge, to\nimagine how much they would pay to avoid\nthe kind of pain and suffering that the\nvictim of the defendant\u2019s negligence\nexperienced or how much they would demand\nto experience it willingly, 2 Dan B.\nDobbs, Dobbs Law of Remedies: Damages-\nEquity-Restitution sec. 8.1(4), p. 383 (2d\ned. 1993); or to estimate how much it\nwould cost the victim (if he survived) to\nobtain counseling or therapy to minimize\nthe pain and suffering, Law Commission,\nDamages for Personal Injury: Non-Pecuniary\nLoss 8 (Consultation Paper No. 140, 1995);\nAndrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd.,\n(1978) 83 D.L.R. (3d) 452, 476-77 (Can. S.\nCt.), or how much they would demand to\nassume the risk of the pain and suffering\nthat the victim experienced. Mark\nGeistfeld, \"Placing a Price on Pain and\nSuffering: A Method for Helping Juries\nDetermine Tort Damages for Nonmonetary\nInjuries,\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 773, 818-28\n(1995). If they said they would demand\n$1,000 to assume a .01 risk of such a\nmisfortune, this would imply that the\nvictim should receive an award of $100,000,\nas that is the judgment that, if\nanticipated, would have induced the\ndefendant to spend up to $1,000 to\nprevent. Talk is cheap, though; and maybe\na better approach would be to present the\njury with evidence of how potential victims\nthemselves evaluate such risks, an approach\nthat has been used to infer the value of\nlife from people\u2019s behavior in using safety\ndevices such as automobile seatbelts or in\ndemanding risk premiums to work at\nhazardous jobs. See, e.g., Richard Thaler\n& Sherwin Rosen, \"The Value of Saving a\nLife: Evidence from the Labor Market,\" in\nHousehold Production and Consumption 265\n(Nestor E. Terleckyj ed. 1975); W. Kip\nViscusi, \"The Value of Risks to Life and\nHealth,\" 31 J. Econ.

Risk\n& Uncertainty 235 (1995).\n\f  Most courts do not follow any of these\napproaches. Instead they treat the\ndetermination of how much damages for pain\nand suffering to award as a standardless,\nunguided exercise of discretion by the\ntrier of fact, reviewable for abuse of\ndiscretion pursuant to no standard to guide\nthe reviewing court either. To minimize the\narbitrary variance in awards bound to\nresult from such a throw-up-the-hands\napproach, the trier of fact should, as is\ndone routinely in England, J. Munkman,\nDamages for Personal Injury and Death 162-\n63 (7th ed. 1985); Law Commission, supra,\nat 19-22, be informed of the amounts of\npain and suffering damages awarded in\nsimilar cases.

But the Erie\ndoctrine, a limitation on federal judicial\nintervention in disputes that arise under\nstate law, is not directly applicable to a\nsuit against the United States. Here state\nlaw is being borrowed only because there\nis no well developed body of federal\ncommon law concerning the common torts such\nas negligence, not because there is a\nstate interest in the outcome of the suit.\nIt is true that Erie was not merely a\nconstitutional decision but also an\ninterpretation of the Rules of Decision\nAct, 28 U.S.C. sec. 1652--but that Act\nprovides only that \"the laws of the\nseveral states . . . shall be regarded as\nrules of decision in civil actions in the\ncourts of the United States, in cases\nwhere they [the laws of the several\nstates] apply\" (emphasis added), and they\ndo not apply, in the sense of govern, the\nconduct of the United States.\n\n  The distinction between borrowing and\napplying state law is perhaps most clearly\nestablished in cases involving the\nborrowing of a state statute of limitations\nfor use in litigation based on a federal\nstatute. See, e.g., West v. Conrail, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111857\"><a href=\"/opinion/111857/west-v-conrail/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 n. 4 (1987); Doe v.

As we put it in\nHemmings, \"When a federal court borrows a\nstate statute of limitations for use in\nconnection with a federal statute that does\nnot have its own statute of limitations,\nthe court is not applying state law; it is\napplying federal law. It looks to state\nlaw for guidance. . . . The analysis\nwould, however, be different if Count I\nwere a diversity rather than federal-\nquestion count. For purposes of the Erie\ndoctrine the statute of limitations is\nsubstantive rather than procedural, and the\nfederal court therefore applies state law--\nit doesn\u2019t just borrow it.\" Id.\n\n  Nor is a practice of consulting damages\nawards in comparable cases for purposes of\nfacilitating a more thoughtful,\ndisciplined, and informed award in the\nparticular case the same thing as a rule\nlimiting awards within a range set by\nprevious cases, one understanding of the\nstate law rule involved in Gasperini: an\naward of damages was not to \"deviate\nmaterially\" from awards that had been made\n\fin comparable cases. Nor is it easy to\ncharacterize a practice of not consulting\ncomparable awards as a remedial rule, hence\n\"substantive\" in the Erie sense, rather\nthan as a rule of evidence; or a practice\nof such consultation by a reviewing court\nendeavoring to carry out its duty to\nprevent abuses of discretion in the award\nof damages as anything more than a rule of\nappellate procedure. So on multiple\ngrounds, what indeed appears to be the\nrule in Illinois, that comparable awards\nfor pain and suffering are not to be\nconsidered at either the appellate or the\ntrial stage, see, e.g., Epping v.\nCommonwealth Edison Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2100972\"><a href=\"/opinion/2100972/epping-v-commonwealth-edison-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">734</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n918-19 (Ill.

App. 1993), does not bind\nus in this case.\n\n  In any event, any argument that we should\nnot look at comparable awards in reviewing\nthe award of pain and suffering damages in\nthis case has been forfeited by the\nplaintiff, who, while citing Epping for the\nproposition stated in her brief that \"not\nall courts agree that comparison of damage\nawards aids in evaluating their propriety,\"\nhas not argued that Illinois forbids such\ncomparisons or that, if it does, its rule\nbinds us. Instead, both parties have cited\nwhat they deem comparable cases. Only their\nnotions of comparability are stunted. The\nplaintiff cites three cases in which\ndamages for pain and suffering ranging from\n$600,000 to $1 million were awarded, but\nin each one the pain and suffering\ncontinued for hours, not minutes. The\ndefendant confined its search for\ncomparable cases to other prison suicide\ncases, implying that prisoners experience\npain and suffering differently from other\npersons, so that it makes more sense to\ncompare Johnson\u2019s pain and suffering to\nthat of a prisoner who suffered a\ntoothache than to that of a free person\nwho was strangled, and concluding absurdly\nthat any award for pain and suffering in\nthis case that exceeded $5,000 would be\nexcessive.

The\n$1.6 million awarded by the judge was far\nhigher than the amount requested by the\nplaintiff (which was $300,000 to $600,000)\nand came after the judge, in accordance\nwith the principle of comparative\nnegligence, had reduced the award on the\nground that Johnson\u2019s own conduct, that is,\nhis hanging himself, required his estate to\nbear some of the responsibility for the\npain and suffering that the hanging\ninflicted on him. The judge did not\nindicate from what level (or by what\npercentage) he had reduced the award to\n$1.6 million.\n\n  But as we said the plaintiff failed to\nestablish liability. The judgment must\ntherefore be reversed with instructions to\nenter judgment for the government.\n\nReversed.\n\n\n\n\n  RIPPLE, Circuit Judge, dissenting.\n\n1.\n\n  On June 7, 1993, Robert Johnson committed\nsuicide by hanging himself from an overhead\npipe using his bedsheet. The facts that\nled up to that tragedy are the basis of\nthis lawsuit.\n\n  An understanding of the issue before us--\nand of the import of the majority\u2019s\nconclusion--will be best understood if the\ncircumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson\u2019s\nsuicide are placed in the broader factual\ncontext of the case.\n\n  Mr. Johnson was arrested and incarcerated\nat Metropolitan Correction Center (\"MCC\")\nin Chicago while awaiting trial on\nextortion charges. During his\nincarceration, Mr. Johnson was first\ndetained on the thirteenth floor, and\nlater, was moved to the seventeenth. By\n\fall accounts, Mr. Johnson was not well on\neither floor. Mr. Johnson was described by\ninmates and guards alike as being a\nnervous and anxious person. Different\ninmates testified that Mr. Johnson did not\neat or sleep well and that his emotional\nwell-being was poor. Inmates alternately\ndescribe Mr. Johnson\u2019s mood as very\nnervous, unstable, and worried. They\ntestified that Mr. Johnson spent a great\ndeal of time by himself and that he became\nless and less social as his incarceration\nprogressed. Mr. Johnson\u2019s last cellmate,\nAlvin McCarver, also testified that during\nthe night, Mr. Johnson would be up\nalternately vomiting and brushing his teeth\nuntil his gums bled./1\n\n  Even more apparent than his general state\nof mind was a disturbing nervous habit\nthat Mr. Johnson acquired. Mr. Johnson\nwould scratch and pick at his skin,\ncausing open sores that would bleed. Once\nhe would cause these sores, Mr. Johnson\nwould continue to pick at them with his\nfingers, manicure scissors, playing cards,\nor apparently anything else that was\navailable. This continual scratching and\npicking caused the sores to fester and\nooze blood; they never properly healed./2\n\n  Several inmates went out of their way to\nhelp Mr. Johnson. Thomas Johnson testified\nthat, a few days prior to Mr. Johnson\u2019s\nsuicide, Johnson had told a guard that he\nthought Mr. Johnson was in need of\npsychiatric care. Jeffery Sorrenson, a\nformer cellmate of Mr. Johnson, testified\nthat he went to a female officer to\ncomplain about Mr. Johnson\u2019s nervous habits\nand hygiene. Derrick Anderson encouraged\nMr. Johnson to see a doctor and even\naccompanied him to sick call on the final\nmorning of Mr. Johnson\u2019s life.\n\n  The efforts of two inmates in particular\nare especially noteworthy. Richard Dover\nmet Mr. Johnson while they both were on\nthe thirteenth floor; Dover also was placed\non the seventeenth floor with Mr. Johnson.\nDover testified that two other inmates and\nhe approached at least three guards in an\nattempt to get medical assistance for Mr.\nJohnson. Dover pointed out Mr. Johnson\u2019s\nsymptoms and said that Mr. Johnson needed\nto go to a hospital. Dover testified that\nnothing came of these conversations: \"We\nalways stayed up onto the guards, trying\nto get them to do something about it, and\nthey never did.\" Dover Dep. at 21.\n\f  Alvin McCarver, Mr. Johnson\u2019s final\ncellmate, also sought help for Mr. Johnson.\nEven though McCarver shared a cell with\nMr. Johnson for only a short time,\nMcCarver already knew of Mr. Johnson\u2019s\nproblems just from living on the same\nfloor. After becoming cellmates, however,\nhis awareness of the problem increased. One\nday, while Mr. Johnson was at an attorney\nvisit, McCarver brought a unit officer into\ntheir cell to see Mr. Johnson\u2019s blood-\nstained sheets./3 McCarver told the\nofficer that \"[s]omething needs to be done\nabout this. This guy needs some help. He\nhas a nervous condition.\" McCarver Dep. at\n27. Because McCarver believed the unit\nofficer had not done anything, McCarver\nthen spoke to Mark Cunneen, a counselor\nassigned to the seventeenth floor. McCarver\ntold Cunneen that Mr. Johnson needed\npsychiatric care and that perhaps\nantidepressant medication was in order.\nMcCarver testified that this meeting\nhappened only days before Mr. Johnson\ncommitted suicide.\n\n  The night before Mr. Johnson\u2019s suicide,\nMcCarver filled out a sick call sheet for\nMr. Johnson. A sick call sheet was a\nrequest to see medical personnel. On the\nsheet, McCarver described Mr. Johnson\u2019s\ncomplaint as open sores caused by nerves.\nIn the box next to the question whether\nthe complaint was serious, McCarver checked\nyes twice. However, when the physician\u2019s\nassistant (\"PA\") saw Mr. Johnson the next\nmorning, she did not have the sick call\nsheet with her, in violation of prison\npolicy.\n\n  Mr. Johnson told the PA that he was\nnervous and that he wanted something to\ncalm him down. Again in violation of\npolicy, the PA told Mr. Johnson to make an\nappointment with a psychologist rather than\nreferring Mr. Johnson personally.\n\n  The compassionate attempts by inmates to\nhelp Mr. Johnson were to little avail.\nThere is no evidence that any prison\nofficial attempted to get Mr. Johnson any\ntype of medical attention. At least one\nprison official testified that he knew of\nMr. Johnson\u2019s problems. Officer James Young\nadmitted that McCarver had confronted him\nabout the blood-stained linens, but he\nnonetheless failed to seek assistance for\nMr. Johnson. Other prison officials claimed\nto have no memory of Mr. Johnson. Cunneen,\n\fthe counselor that McCarver testified he\nspoke to, claimed no recollection either of\nMr. Johnson or of any conversation with\nMcCarver regarding Mr. Johnson. The\ndistrict court found that McCarver\u2019s\ntestimony was \"adamant and precise\" and\nthat Cunneen\u2019s testimony \"strains\ncredulity.\" R.38 at 14.\n\n  Through their combined efforts, inmates\nwere able to cajole Mr. Johnson into\nseeking help for his problems. After months\nof suffering alone, Mr. Johnson went to\nthe PA in hopes of receiving help. When\nthe PA failed to treat Mr. Johnson\nadequately, the last opportunity to help\nMr. Johnson was lost. Twelve hours later,\nMr. Johnson took his own life.\n\n2.\n\n  The majority holds that the United States\ncannot be liable for Mr. Johnson\u2019s death.\nSpecifically, the majority reasons that Mr.\nJohnson\u2019s suicide was not foreseeable and\nthat the Government was not the proximate\ncause of Mr. Johnson\u2019s death. I\nrespectfully disagree.\n\n  \"The district court\u2019s determination of\nforeseeability is a factual determination\nreviewable only for clear error.\" United\nStates v. Bullis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714126\"><a href=\"/opinion/714126/united-states-v-jerome-w-bullis/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1553</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1564 (7th\nCir. 1996). I do not believe that the\ndistrict court clearly erred in its\ndetermination that Mr. Johnson\u2019s suicide\nwas foreseeable. The record offers ample\nevidence that demonstrates that prison\nofficials should have known that Mr.\nJohnson was suffering severe emotional\ndistress. As the district court\nnoted,pretrial detainees like Mr. Johnson\nhave a greater risk of suicide than the\npopulation in general. This reality should\nhave alerted prison officials to scrutinize\nseriously the numerous reports they\nreceived concerning Mr. Johnson\u2019s\ndeteriorating psychiatric state.\n\n  Inmates testified that Mr. Johnson\nbrushed his teeth until they bled, that he\nwas up at nights vomiting, and that he\nscratched his skin until it bled. Mr.\nJohnson was described as a loner who had\nproblems sleeping and eating. On more than\none occasion, inmates such as Alvin\nMcCarver brought these symptoms to the\nattention of prison officials. Prison\nofficials chose to do nothing.\n\f  Undoubtedly, it is easier for officials\nto know that someone is having suicidal\nthoughts when that person says that he is\nhaving suicidal thoughts. However, having\nan inmate in custody creates a duty of\ncare that must include enough attention to\nmental health concerns that inmates with\nobvious symptoms receive medical attention.\nPrison officials had numerous opportunities\nto meet their responsibilities to help Mr.\nJohnson, but no one did. One cannot avoid\nresponsibility by putting one\u2019s head in the\nsand.\n\n3.\n\n  The court reviews factual findings, such\nas the existence of proximate cause, for\nclear error and will not reverse if the\ndistrict court\u2019s findings are plausible in\nlight of the entire record.

The combination of this\ninaction caused Mr. Johnson\u2019s death.\n\n  I believe it to be entirely permissible\nfor the district court to determine that\nthe collective failure of prison officials\nto provide medical assistance for Mr.\nJohnson was the proximate cause of his\ndeath. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s\nconclusion is not clearly erroneous and\nmust be upheld.\n\n4.\n\n  I also cannot join the majority\u2019s\ndiscussion of the damage award in this\ncase. First, the point should be made that\nthe majority concedes that \"our analysis\nmakes it unnecessary\" to consider the\ndamage award in this case. Maj. Op. at 8.\nBecause the discussion of this issue is\nnot necessary to determine the outcome of\nthis case, it is \"purely dicta\" and \"does\nnot constitute the law of the case or any\nother binding precedent for our current\nconsideration.\" Thomas & Betts Corp. v.\nPanduit Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752092\"><a href=\"/opinion/752092/thomas-betts-corporation-and-thomas-betts-holdings-inc-v-panduit/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 289 n.4 (7th\nCir. 1998). We have noted that:\n\nDicta are the parts of an opinion that are\nnot binding on a subsequent court, whether\n\fas a matter of stare decisis or as a\nmatter of law of the case. . . . They are\nnon-binding for two reasons. First, not\nbeing integral elements of the analysis\nunderlying the decision . . . they may not\nexpress the judges\u2019 most careful, focused\nthinking. Second, to give the inessential\nparts of an opinion the force of law would\ngive judges too much power, and of an\nessentially legislative character; we could\nhardly consider ourselves judges in the\nAnglo-American tradition were we to\ninterrupt this opinion to offer our\nthoughts.\n\nWilder v.

Hanging is an excruciatingly\npainful and cruel way to die. Of the\nforty-eight states that once allowed\nexecutions by hanging, only two\njurisdictions still do. More specifically:\n\nIn properly-performed hangings, the neck\nbreaks immediately and unconsciousness is\nsupposedly instantaneous. However, hanging\nhas been called an \"art,\" and considerable\nskill is necessary to ensure that the neck\nbreaks . . . . In most instances, however,\nthis [break] does not result, and the\ncondemned dies a violent and lingering\ndeath. If the drop is too long, the\nprisoner may be decapitated, causing great\nindignity to the body. If the drop is too\nshort, the inmate may slowly strangle to\ndeath. In strangulation, extreme pain is\nevident: the eyeballs pop out, the tongue\nswells and protrudes, the rope can pull\nhunks of flesh off the face, and the neck\nelongates and distorts. As it is so often\nimproperly performed, the risk of either\ndecapitation or slow strangulation is\nlikely.\n\nKristina E. Beard, Comment, Five Under the\nEighth: Methodology Review and the Cruel\nand Unusual Punishments Clause, 51 U. Miami\nL. Rev. 445, 464 (1997).\n\n  Given that a professional execution, in\nat least a semi-controlled environment,\nleads to an agonizing death, it seems\napparent that a depressed man with only an\noverhead pipe and a bedsheet would suffer\na great deal. Dr. Kern, an ear, nose, and\n\fthroat surgeon, reviewed the documentation\nfor Mr. Johnson\u2019s case and testified as to\nhis findings. Dr. Kern explained that death\nfrom a self-hanging is slower than a\njudicial hanging. Like in Mr. Johnson\u2019s\ncase, the individual usually falls a short\ndistance and uses a material that is\nlooser on the neck than a rope. These\ncircumstances combine to cause a slow\nsuffocation. If a person succeeds in\ncompletely blocking his airway, that person\nmay lose consciousness as quickly as in\nthree minutes. However, Mr. Johnson\n\"assuredly\" could not achieve total airway\nblockage using the bedsheet. Tr.II at 140.\nWhile suffocating, Mr. Johnson experienced\nthe phenomenon known as \"air hunger\" during\nwhich the body wants oxygen but cannot get\nit. Air hunger causes extreme anxiety and\nfear. Dr. Kern testified that it was very\nlikely that Mr. Johnson was conscious\nlonger than three minutes and may have\nsuffered up to twenty.\n\n  Drowning is also clearly a traumatic\nexperience. When a person in the water\nbegins to take water in, the automatic\nphysiological reaction is that the muscle\nat the entrance of the windpipe contracts,\npreventing water from entering the lungs.\nSee Am. Med. Ass\u2019n, Encyclopedia of\nMedicine 375 (1989). However, this\ncontraction impairs breathing; without\naccess to oxygen, the brain begins to be\naffected within thirty seconds, and the\nindividual quickly loses consciousness. See\nid.; see also Roy W. Rafter, The Anatomy\nof Drowning, at\nhttp://www.airsearchrescue.com/drowning.h\ntm. Depending on the physical status of\nthe victim, death often occurs in two\nminutes or less.\n\n  The differences between drowning and\nhanging are far too great to cabin the\ndiscretion of the trial court by making\nthe court treat them as one and the same.\nThe standard of review for damage awards\nis still an abuse of discretion.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 Admittedly, these individuals are not experts.\nHowever, when even a lay person recognizes that\nan individual needs help, it does not reflect\nwell on the experts who remain oblivious to the\nsituation.\n\n/2 Although the defendants suggest that this scrat-\nching may have been caused by a skin condition,\n\fthey offer no evidence to support that conten-\ntion. Additionally, at least one inmate, Derrick\nAnderson, testified that Mr. Johnson told him\nthat he scratched because he was nervous, not\nbecause of a skin problem.\n\n/3 MCC policy requires blood-stained linens to be\nlaundered in a particular manner to guard against\nblood-born pathogens. That policy was never\nfollowed in this case.\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": true}
