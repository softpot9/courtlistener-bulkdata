Although she is the prevailing party, appellant Taliba C.\nJohnson contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the\ninadequate damages awarded, and that the trial court reversibly erred in excluding certain\nevidence. We affirm.\n\f                     I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In February 2010, Taliba Johnson hired Gregory Luchin to replace her roof and\nperform some remodeling work at her home in exchange for a total payment of $6,650.\nLuchin prepared the parties\u2019 written contract, in which they agreed that Johnson would\npay $3,325 as a down payment, then pay another $2,000 upon completion of the roof, and\nfinally, pay the remaining $1,325 upon completion of the entire project.\n\n       Johnson paid Luchin $3,325 at the outset as agreed, but he did not perform the\nwork in the order she expected. Although the order of tasks was not specified in the\ncontract, Johnson expected Luchin to begin the contract by replacing her roof, but he\ninstead began painting one of Johnson\u2019s bathrooms. Johnson was further concerned\nwhen Luchin did not resume work for several days. When he returned to work at her\nhouse, Johnson refused to allow him to continue, and instead demanded a refund. Luchin\ndid not return Johnson\u2019s down payment, and she filed suit in small-claims court. The\nsmall-claims court ordered Luchin to pay Johnson only $2,300, and Johnson appealed her\ncase to the county civil court at law for trial de novo.\n\n       In the second trial, Johnson and Luchin both appeared pro se. The trial court\nactively questioned Johnson, who offered documentary evidence that included a copy of\nthe parties\u2019 contract and photographs intended to show the extent to which Luchin left\ntasks unfinished and damaged other property. The trial court examined the contract and\nphotographs, but did not admit them into evidence. Instead, the trial court elicited\ntestimony from Luchin regarding the extent to which he completed the contract and his\nopinion of the fair-market value of the work he performed. Although Johnson had not\nrested, the trial court announced that it was awarding her $1,975 plus court costs.\nJohnson told the court that she had an estimate and canceled checks showing the costs\nshe incurred to complete the work, but the trial court refused to admit them, explaining\nthat those damages could be proved only through an expert\u2019s in-court or affidavit\ntestimony that the costs were reasonable and necessary.\n\n       Johnson subsequently obtained counsel and moved for a new trial, attaching a\n\n                                               2\n\fcomplete trial transcript and copies of much of the excluded evidence. The trial court\ndenied the motion, and no findings of fact and conclusions of law were requested or\nissued.\n\n                                    II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n          In her first two issues, Johnson challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the\nevidence supporting the judgment. She argues in a third issue that the trial court abused\nits discretion in excluding her documentary evidence.\n\n                                        III. ANALYSIS\n\n          In a nonjury trial, if no findings of fact or conclusions of law were filed or\nproperly requested, we presume that the trial court made all findings in support of its\njudgment. Roberson v. Robinson, 768 S.W.2d 280, 281 (Tex. 1989) (per curiam). If a\ncomplete reporter\u2019s record is part of the appellate record, the legal and factual sufficiency\nof the trial court\u2019s implied findings may be challenged on appeal using the same\nstandards of review applicable to a jury\u2019s findings. Mays v. Pierce, 203 S.W.3d 564, 571\n(Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied).\n\nA.        Legal and Factual Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n          To analyze the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting a finding, we review\nthe record in the light most favorable to the factual findings, crediting favorable evidence\nif a reasonable factfinder could and disregarding contrary evidence unless a reasonable\nfactfinder could not.      City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005).\nEvidence is legally sufficient if it \u201crises to a level that would enable reasonable and fair-\nminded people to differ in their conclusions.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d\n598, 601 (Tex. 2004). Evidence is legally insufficient only if (1) there is a complete\nabsence of evidence of a vital fact, (2) the court is barred by rules of law or evidence\nfrom giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact, (3) the evidence\noffered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla, or (4) the evidence\nconclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 810.\n\n                                               3\n\fOn the other hand, a factfinder \u201cmay not simply speculate that a particular inference\narises from the evidence.\u201d Serv. Corp. Int\u2019l v. Guerra, 348 S.W.3d 221, 228 (Tex. 2011).\nIf the evidence does no more than give rise to mere surmise or suspicion, then it is no\nevidence. Id.\n\n        In evaluating a factual-sufficiency challenge, we consider and weigh all the\nevidence in a neutral light and will set aside the finding only if the evidence is so weak or\nthe finding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is\nclearly wrong and unjust. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001).\nWe defer to a trial court\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by evidence. Perry\nHomes v. Cull, 258 S.W.3d 580, 598 (Tex. 2008). We keep in mind that we may not pass\nupon the witnesses\u2019 credibility or substitute our judgment for that of the factfinder, even\nif the evidence clearly would support a different result. Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis,\n971 S.W.2d 402, 407 (Tex. 1998).\n\n        1.      Implied Finding at Issue\n\n        Before we can address Johnson\u2019s legal and factual sufficiency arguments, we must\nidentify the implied finding that she contends is inadequately supported by the evidence.\nJohnson has not discussed the theory under which the trial court awarded damages, but\nwe presume that the trial court made all of its implied factual findings in a manner that is\nconsistent with the judgment if such findings are supported by the record. Here, the trial\ncourt awarded Johnson $1,975, which is the amount that Johnson paid Luchin, minus the\namount that the trial court determined to be the value of the work Luchin performed. 1 On\n\n        1\n           Although the trial court\u2019s statements during trial are not findings of fact, the findings that we\nhave implied are consistent with the trial court\u2019s comments to the parties. Specifically, the trial court\nstated as follows:\n        Listen, this is a trial over who exchanged what and basically you [Luchin] are entitled to\n        the value of the fair market value. I asked you. You are under oath. You testified to a\n        number of 1350. You can\u2019t produce any additional receipts for me to add to that number.\n        She gave you a 3325 check and you didn\u2019t finish the job. Sounds to me like you had a\n        mutual falling out or she fired you, so, the work is clearly not finished even if you\n        [Johnson] locked him out. But he did do some of the work. He is entitled to be paid for\n        the work that he did. So, I\u2019m going to award the Plaintiff $1,975 . . . .\n\n                                                     4\n\fthis record, the trial court reasonably could have reached this result by finding that\nJohnson breached the contract first, thereby preventing Luchin from completing his work.\nThe trial court then could have reduced Johnson\u2019s recovery by an amount equal to the\nvalue of Luchin\u2019s work.      See Truly v. Austin, 744 S.W.2d 934, 937 (Tex. 1988)\n(explaining that party who has partially performed an express contract can recover in\nquantum meruit for the reasonable value of his services if the other party\u2019s breach\nprevents him from completing the contract).\n\n       Although Luchin\u2019s testimony concerns the \u201cfair market value\u201d of his work rather\nthan its \u201creasonable\u201d value, Johnson does not contend that the wrong measure of damages\nwas applied, or that the fair-market value of Luchin\u2019s work is not probative of its\nreasonable value. See also Beeman v. Worrell, 612 S.W.2d 953, 957 (Tex. Civ. App.\u2014\nDallas 1981, no writ) (stating that, in some circumstances, the market value of the labor\nand materials may be a proper measure of quantum meruit recovery). Instead, Johnson\nchallenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s implied\nfinding that the value of the services Luchin performed was $1,350. She argues that\n(1) there is no evidence that Luchin is qualified to offer expert testimony concerning the\nvalue of his work; and (2) because Luchin did not identify the basis for his opinion, there\nis no evidence that his testimony regarding value was based on reliable methodology.\n\n       2.     Absence of Evidence of Luchin\u2019s Qualifications\n\n       A challenge to an expert\u2019s qualifications must be preserved with a timely and\nspecific objection. Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. v. Armstrong, 145 S.W.3d 131, 143\u201344 (Tex.\n2004) (holding issue of expert\u2019s qualifications was not preserved by the appropriate\nobjection). Because Johnson failed to object at trial that Luchin was unqualified to offer\nan expert opinion on the value of the work he performed, this argument has not been\npreserved for our review. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a).\n\n       3.     Absence of Evidence of Luchin\u2019s Methodology\n\n       In her remaining evidentiary-sufficiency challenge, Johnson argues that Luchin\u2019s\n\n\n                                              5\n\fopinion of the value of the work is unreliable because he did not identify the method by\nwhich he calculated the fair-market value of his work, and instead, he simply asserted\nthat it was worth a certain amount. She further contends that \u201cthere is simply too great an\nanalytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Ledesma,\n242 S.W.3d 32, 39 (Tex. 2007) (quoting Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., 972\nS.W.2d 713, 726 (Tex. 1998)).\n\n       These arguments are based on two assumptions: first, that the trial court treated\nLuchin\u2019s testimony as an expert opinion, and second, that Luchin\u2019s opinions were based\non calculations that he was required to state on the record. But, neither assumption is\nnecessary.\n\n       First, the trial court may have admitted and considered Luchin\u2019s testimony as a lay\nopinion on the value of the services he provided. See Johnston v. Kruse, 261 S.W.3d\n895, 902 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2008, no pet.) (\u201cThe measure of damages for a quantum\nmeruit claim is the reasonable value of the work performed. . . . Reasonable value may be\nestablished through lay testimony.\u201d (citing Lamajak, Inc. v. Frazin, 230 S.W.3d 786, 796\n(Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2007, no pet.))). Johnson does not argue that the value of Luchin\u2019s\nservices could be proved only by expert testimony, and does not complain that the trial\ncourt erred in admitting Luchin\u2019s testimony as a lay opinion on the value of his work.\n\n       Second, Luchin\u2019s testimony about the value of each task he performed on an\nitemized list is sufficient to support the implied finding about the total value of those\nservices. The record shows that Luchin was asked almost exclusively about the value of\nhis services in performing individual tasks, and the trial court calculated the total.\nSpecifically, the court asked, \u201cWhat is the fair market value of the paint you did in the\nbathroom?\u201d and Luchin answered, \u201cAbout $700.\u201d The trial court asked, \u201cWhat is the fair\nmarket value of the tile work that you actually did that you didn\u2019t finish?\u201d and Luchin\nresponded, \u201cI actually did about 350.\u201d The trial court asked, \u201cWhat about the sinks,\nfaucets and drains, did you do anything to those?\u201d Luchin answered, \u201cYes. 150 each,\u201d\nand Johnson testified that Luchin had worked on two sinks. These items total $1,350,\n\n                                            6\n\fand the amount that Luchin was ordered to pay Johnson is exactly $1,350 less than the\n$3,325 down payment he received from her.2 In effect, Luchin offered specific testimony\nabout the value of each task on an itemized list, and the trial court performed the\ncalculations required to arrive at the total value of the services he performed. See Green\nGarden Packaging Co. v. Schoenmann Produce Co., No. 01-09-00924-CV, 2010 WL\n4395448, at *7 n.5 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] Nov. 4, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.)\n(explaining that a party seeking to recover in quantum meruit \u201cmust introduce evidence\nregarding the value of the services it provided,\u201d and can satisfy that burden \u201cby providing\nspecific testimony about the amount of compensation to which they would be entitled for\nthe services rendered\u201d). Because the services were provided by Luchin (individually and\nd/b/a Luchin & Sons Construction), his testimony about the value of his services in\nperforming discrete tasks is legally sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s implied finding,\neven though he did not describe the method by which he arrived at the stated figure. See\nHawkins v. Black, 23 S.W.2d 755, 756 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 1929, no writ)\n(overruling challenge to the admission of plaintiff\u2019s testimony \u201cthat the charges made by\nhim for the different items of service\u201d were reasonable and customary, because \u201cplaintiff\nshowed himself to be a practicing attorney in Fort Worth for a number of years, and was\nthoroughly qualified to give his opinion as to the value of his services\u201d). 3 We further\nconclude that, because his testimony about the value of particular tasks was\nuncontroverted, the evidence is factually sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s implied\nfinding.\n\n        We accordingly overrule Johnson\u2019s first and second issues.\n\n\n        2\n         Luchin also was asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the fair market value of the work you did do and didn\u2019t finish?\u201d\nHe answered, \u201cThat\u2019s about a hundred.\u201d The trial court apparently resolved the conflict in the evidence\nby disregarding this testimony.\n        3\n          Cf. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. \u00a7 18.001 (West 2008) (providing that legally sufficient\nevidence supports a finding that a charge is reasonable if the person who provided the service or was in\ncharge of records showing the services and charges has provided an uncontroverted, itemized affidavit\nattesting that the amount charged \u201cwas reasonable at the time and place that the service was provided,\u201d\neven though the affidavit does not show how the affiant arrived at those conclusions).\n\n                                                   7\n\fB.     Exclusion of Evidence\n\n       Johnson next argues that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Luchin\nto provide expert testimony while refusing to allow Johnson to offer \u201cpictures, receipts,\nrepair estimates, and other testimony concerning her damages.\u201d Before reaching the\nmerits of this Johnson\u2019s argument, however, we first must determine if her complaint has\nbeen preserved for review. See McInnes v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A., 673 S.W.2d\n185, 187 (Tex. 1984).\n\n       1.     Preservation of Johnson\u2019s Complaint\n\n       \u201cThere are two types of offers to preserve error: the offer of proof (formerly\nreferred to as an informal bill of exception) and the formal bill of exception.\u201d Lone Starr\nMulti-Theatres, Ltd. v. Max Interests, Ltd., 365 S.W.3d 688, 703 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.). An offer of proof is required to preserve for appeal the\ncomplaint that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence. TEX. R. EVID. 103(a)(2).\nOne makes an offer of proof by making the substance of the evidence known to the court;\nthe substance of the excluded evidence also may be \u201capparent from the context within\nwhich questions were asked.\u201d Id. The offer will not preserve error effectively unless the\nrecord shows the nature of the evidence with sufficient specificity to allow the reviewing\ncourt to determine whether the trial court erred in excluding it. In re N.R.C., 94 S.W.3d\n799, 806 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). If the offer of proof does\nnot otherwise appear in the record, the complaint can be preserved through a formal bill\nof exception. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.2; In re Estate of Miller, 243 S.W.3d 831, 837 (Tex.\nApp.\u2014Dallas 2008, no pet.).\n\n       Although the excluded \u201cpictures, receipts, repair estimates, and other testimony\u201d\nwere not admitted into evidence, included in the reporter\u2019s record, or incorporated into a\nformal bill of exception, the reporter\u2019s record does reveal that Johnson offered this\nmaterial at trial. Thus, the real question is whether the record shows the substance of the\nexcluded evidence with sufficient specificity to allow us to determine whether the trial\ncourt reversibly erred in excluding the evidence.\n\n                                            8\n\f        Attached to and incorporated in Johnson\u2019s motion for new trial were copies of\n(a) the complete trial transcript; (b) Luchin\u2019s business card; (c) the parties\u2019 contract; (d) a\nlist apparently prepared by Johnson, entitled \u201cConstruction To Be Done,\u201d with\nhandwritten notations indicating tasks that were \u201cNot Attempted,\u201d \u201cIncomplete,\u201d\n\u201cContracted Out,\u201d or that \u201cCaused Damage\u201d; (e) a set of thirty-two photographs, on\nwhich Johnson indicated unfinished work or damage; (f) an unsigned estimate on the\nletterhead of \u201cFrenchs Remodeling Specialist, LLC,\u201d containing handwritten underlining,\ncheck marks, question marks, and calculations; (g) correspondence between the parties;\nand (h) pleadings filed in the small-claims court. At the hearing on the motion for new\ntrial, the trial court stated, \u201cWhat I remember is the pictures.\u201d When Johnson\u2019s counsel\nstated that at trial Johnson \u201chad pictures and receipts of things to show the work that was\ndone,\u201d the trial court stated, \u201cI remember.\u201d4\n\n        From these exchanges, it appears that the photographs offered in connection with\nJohnson\u2019s motion for new trial are the same photographs offered at trial. See Patteson v.\nState, 633 S.W.2d 549, 551 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1982, no writ) (trial\ncourt\u2019s statement on the record at a hearing on a motion for new trial \u201ccan serve as an\ninformal bill of exception on the subject\u201d). In addition, the nature of Johnson\u2019s excluded\ntestimony is apparent from the context, because when the trial court refused to allow\nfurther evidence, Johnson protested, \u201cI haven\u2019t shown you what it cost to actually finish\nthat work and the estimates that are so far over the amount of work that he did.\u201d See\nCrown Life Ins. Co. v. Estate of Gonzalez, 820 S.W.2d 121, 121 (Tex. 1991) (stating that\nappellate court rules are \u201cto be liberally construed so that the decisions of the courts of\nappeals turn on substance rather than procedural technicality\u201d). We therefore conclude\nthat Johnson\u2019s complaints regarding the exclusion of the photographs and the limitation\nof her testimony have been preserved with sufficient specificity to permit our review.\n\n\n\n        4\n          The material offered at trial and the material attached to the motion for new trial do not overlap\nperfectly. The canceled checks and receipts offered at trial do not appear anywhere in the record, and\ncorrespondence, list, and business card attached to the motion for new trial were not mentioned at trial.\n\n                                                     9\n\f       2.     Standard of Review\n\n       We review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence for an abuse of\ndiscretion. In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570, 575 (Tex. 2005). The test for abuse of\ndiscretion is whether the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules or\nprinciples. E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549, 558 (Tex. 1995).\nWe will uphold the evidentiary ruling if there is any legitimate basis to do so, regardless\nof whether that basis was asserted in the trial court. Hooper v. Chittaluru, 222 S.W.3d\n103, 107 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied) (op. on reh\u2019g).\n\n       Even if the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence, we will not\nreverse unless the ruling probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment. TEX. R.\nAPP. P. 44.1(a)(1); Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp. v. Malone, 972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex.\n1998). In making this determination, we must review the entire record and consider the\nrole that the excluded evidence played in the context of the trial.         State v. Cent.\nExpressway Sign Assocs., 302 S.W.3d 866, 870 (Tex. 2009). A party\u2019s insistence on the\nadmission of particular evidence can be an indication of its importance to that party\u2019s\ncase. See Alvarado v. Farah Mfg. Co., 830 S.W.2d 911, 917 & n.8 (Tex. 1992). \u201c[I]f\nerroneously admitted or excluded evidence was crucial to a key issue, the error is likely\nharmful.\u201d Cent. Expressway Sign Assocs., 302 S.W.3d at 870 (citing Reliance Steel &\nAluminum Co. v. Sevcik, 267 S.W.3d 867, 873 (Tex. 2008)). On the other hand, if the\nevidence is merely cumulative and is not controlling on a material issue dispositive to the\ncase, we typically will not reverse. Interstate Northborough P\u2019ship v. State, 66 S.W.3d\n213, 220 (Tex. 2001).\n\n       3.     Absence of Reversible Error\n\n       On appeal, Johnson contends that the trial court reversibly erred in excluding\nevidence that was (a) offered to rebut Luchin\u2019s testimony about the value of his services,\n(b) relevant to the quality of the work performed, (c) relevant to the \u201cvalue of the damage\nto Ms. Johnson\u2019s home,\u201d or (d) necessary in determining who purchased the supplies\nused. We conclude, however, that there is no reversible error.\n\n                                            10\n\f       First, the record shows that the trial court did consider the photographs. After\nLuchin testified that he replaced a cabinet wall and reinforced the cabinet\u2019s base, Johnson\nstated, \u201cNo. Here\u2019s the pictures.\u201d Johnson then explained what Luchin had agreed to do,\nand the trial court stated, \u201cDoesn\u2019t look very finished.\u201d Although the trial court later\nasked Luchin the value of his services in painting two bathrooms, partially tiling a floor,\nand replacing sinks, the court did not ask Luchin the value of his work on the bathroom\ncabinet. It therefore appears that the trial court did consider the photographs as evidence\nthat partially rebutted Luchin\u2019s testimony about the extent or quality of the work that he\nperformed.    Because the record shows that the trial court actually considered this\nevidence, we cannot conclude that the trial court reversibly erred simply because the\nphotographs were not included as exhibits to the reporter\u2019s record.\n\n       Second, the trial court did not reversibly err in excluding Johnson\u2019s testimony\nabout the amount that she paid to complete or repair Luchin\u2019s work. In a breach-of-\ncontract case, the party seeking to recover the costs of repair or completion must present\nevidence that the damages sought are reasonable and necessary. McGinty v. Hennen, 55\nTex. Sup. Ct. J. 1090, 1091\u201392 (June 29, 2012). \u201cEvidence of the amounts charged and\npaid, standing alone, is no evidence that such payment was reasonable and necessary.\u201d\nMustang Pipeline Co. v. Driver Pipeline Co., 134 S.W.3d 195, 200 (Tex. 2004) (per\ncuriam) (citing Dall. Ry. Terminal Co. v. Gossett, 156 Tex. 252, 259, 294 S.W.2d 377,\n382\u201383 (1956)).    The record does not contain any evidence of the reasonable and\nnecessary costs to complete the work or repair damage caused by Luchin, and Johnson\ndoes not contend that she offered any such evidence.\n\n       Johnson also argues that the trial court erred in excluding the unsigned estimate\nattached to her motion for new trial, but unlike the photographs attached to the motion,\nthe trial judge did not state that she remembered that evidence; thus, we cannot conclude\nthat the evidence attached to the motion is the same evidence offered at trial. In addition,\nJohnson referred at trial to receipts or canceled checks that purportedly showed the\namount she actually paid for the work or for materials, but these documents are not in the\n\n                                            11\n\frecord at all. We therefore are unable to determine what exactly this evidence would\nhave shown.     Nevertheless, even if we could simply assume that all of Johnson\u2019s\nrepresentations about these documents were true, we still could not conclude that the\nexclusion of this material constituted reversible error. Johnson asserts that the estimate,\nchecks, and receipts are evidence of the amounts paid for completion or repair, but she\ndoes not contend that these documents contained evidence that these costs were\nreasonable. Although she also asserts that some of this evidence would have supported\nher contention that she paid for all of the materials used in Luchin\u2019s work, any such\nevidence was cumulative of her testimony that she paid for all supplies. Moreover,\nbecause an implied finding that Johnson paid for all materials is consistent with the\njudgment, we already presume that the trial court made such a finding.\n\n       We accordingly overrule Johnson\u2019s third issue.\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s\nimplied findings in support of the judgment, and because the trial court did not reversibly\nerr in excluding the documentary evidence and additional testimony that Johnson offered\nin support of her claim for damages, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          /s/    Tracy Christopher\n                                                 Justice\n\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Boyce, Christopher, and Jamison.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">Affirmed and Memorandum Opinion filed September 25, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                         In The\n\n                       Fourteenth Court of Appeals\n\n                                 NO. 14-11-00327-CV\n\n                          TALIBA C.

Although she is the prevailing party, appellant Taliba C.\nJohnson contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the\ninadequate damages awarded, and that the trial court reversibly erred in excluding certain\nevidence. We affirm.\n\f                     I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       In February 2010, Taliba Johnson hired Gregory Luchin to replace her roof and\nperform some remodeling work at her home in exchange for a total payment of $6,650.\nLuchin prepared the parties\u2019 written contract, in which they agreed that Johnson would\npay $3,325 as a down payment, then pay another $2,000 upon completion of the roof, and\nfinally, pay the remaining $1,325 upon completion of the entire project.\n\n       Johnson paid Luchin $3,325 at the outset as agreed, but he did not perform the\nwork in the order she expected. Although the order of tasks was not specified in the\ncontract, Johnson expected Luchin to begin the contract by replacing her roof, but he\ninstead began painting one of Johnson\u2019s bathrooms. Johnson was further concerned\nwhen Luchin did not resume work for several days. When he returned to work at her\nhouse, Johnson refused to allow him to continue, and instead demanded a refund. Luchin\ndid not return Johnson\u2019s down payment, and she filed suit in small-claims court. The\nsmall-claims court ordered Luchin to pay Johnson only $2,300, and Johnson appealed her\ncase to the county civil court at law for trial de novo.\n\n       In the second trial, Johnson and Luchin both appeared pro se. The trial court\nactively questioned Johnson, who offered documentary evidence that included a copy of\nthe parties\u2019 contract and photographs intended to show the extent to which Luchin left\ntasks unfinished and damaged other property. The trial court examined the contract and\nphotographs, but did not admit them into evidence. Instead, the trial court elicited\ntestimony from Luchin regarding the extent to which he completed the contract and his\nopinion of the fair-market value of the work he performed. Although Johnson had not\nrested, the trial court announced that it was awarding her $1,975 plus court costs.\nJohnson told the court that she had an estimate and canceled checks showing the costs\nshe incurred to complete the work, but the trial court refused to admit them, explaining\nthat those damages could be proved only through an expert\u2019s in-court or affidavit\ntestimony that the costs were reasonable and necessary.\n\n       Johnson subsequently obtained counsel and moved for a new trial, attaching a\n\n                                               2\n\fcomplete trial transcript and copies of much of the excluded evidence. The trial court\ndenied the motion, and no findings of fact and conclusions of law were requested or\nissued.\n\n                                    II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n          In her first two issues, Johnson challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the\nevidence supporting the judgment. She argues in a third issue that the trial court abused\nits discretion in excluding her documentary evidence.\n\n                                        III. ANALYSIS\n\n          In a nonjury trial, if no findings of fact or conclusions of law were filed or\nproperly requested, we presume that the trial court made all findings in support of its\njudgment.

Implied Finding at Issue\n\n        Before we can address Johnson\u2019s legal and factual sufficiency arguments, we must\nidentify the implied finding that she contends is inadequately supported by the evidence.\nJohnson has not discussed the theory under which the trial court awarded damages, but\nwe presume that the trial court made all of its implied factual findings in a manner that is\nconsistent with the judgment if such findings are supported by the record. Here, the trial\ncourt awarded Johnson $1,975, which is the amount that Johnson paid Luchin, minus the\namount that the trial court determined to be the value of the work Luchin performed. 1 On\n\n        1\n           Although the trial court\u2019s statements during trial are not findings of fact, the findings that we\nhave implied are consistent with the trial court\u2019s comments to the parties. Specifically, the trial court\nstated as follows:\n        Listen, this is a trial over who exchanged what and basically you [Luchin] are entitled to\n        the value of the fair market value. I asked you. You are under oath. You testified to a\n        number of 1350. You can\u2019t produce any additional receipts for me to add to that number.\n        She gave you a 3325 check and you didn\u2019t finish the job.

Johnson does not argue that the value of Luchin\u2019s\nservices could be proved only by expert testimony, and does not complain that the trial\ncourt erred in admitting Luchin\u2019s testimony as a lay opinion on the value of his work.\n\n       Second, Luchin\u2019s testimony about the value of each task he performed on an\nitemized list is sufficient to support the implied finding about the total value of those\nservices.

Absence of Reversible Error\n\n       On appeal, Johnson contends that the trial court reversibly erred in excluding\nevidence that was (a) offered to rebut Luchin\u2019s testimony about the value of his services,\n(b) relevant to the quality of the work performed, (c) relevant to the \u201cvalue of the damage\nto Ms. Johnson\u2019s home,\u201d or (d) necessary in determining who purchased the supplies\nused. We conclude, however, that there is no reversible error.\n\n                                            10\n\f       First, the record shows that the trial court did consider the photographs. After\nLuchin testified that he replaced a cabinet wall and reinforced the cabinet\u2019s base, Johnson\nstated, \u201cNo. Here\u2019s the pictures.\u201d Johnson then explained what Luchin had agreed to do,\nand the trial court stated, \u201cDoesn\u2019t look very finished.\u201d Although the trial court later\nasked Luchin the value of his services in painting two bathrooms, partially tiling a floor,\nand replacing sinks, the court did not ask Luchin the value of his work on the bathroom\ncabinet. It therefore appears that the trial court did consider the photographs as evidence\nthat partially rebutted Luchin\u2019s testimony about the extent or quality of the work that he\nperformed.    Because the record shows that the trial court actually considered this\nevidence, we cannot conclude that the trial court reversibly erred simply because the\nphotographs were not included as exhibits to the reporter\u2019s record.\n\n       Second, the trial court did not reversibly err in excluding Johnson\u2019s testimony\nabout the amount that she paid to complete or repair Luchin\u2019s work. In a breach-of-\ncontract case, the party seeking to recover the costs of repair or completion must present\nevidence that the damages sought are reasonable and necessary. McGinty v.

The record does not contain any evidence of the reasonable and\nnecessary costs to complete the work or repair damage caused by Luchin, and Johnson\ndoes not contend that she offered any such evidence.\n\n       Johnson also argues that the trial court erred in excluding the unsigned estimate\nattached to her motion for new trial, but unlike the photographs attached to the motion,\nthe trial judge did not state that she remembered that evidence; thus, we cannot conclude\nthat the evidence attached to the motion is the same evidence offered at trial. In addition,\nJohnson referred at trial to receipts or canceled checks that purportedly showed the\namount she actually paid for the work or for materials, but these documents are not in the\n\n                                            11\n\frecord at all. We therefore are unable to determine what exactly this evidence would\nhave shown.     Nevertheless, even if we could simply assume that all of Johnson\u2019s\nrepresentations about these documents were true, we still could not conclude that the\nexclusion of this material constituted reversible error. Johnson asserts that the estimate,\nchecks, and receipts are evidence of the amounts paid for completion or repair, but she\ndoes not contend that these documents contained evidence that these costs were\nreasonable. Although she also asserts that some of this evidence would have supported\nher contention that she paid for all of the materials used in Luchin\u2019s work, any such\nevidence was cumulative of her testimony that she paid for all supplies. Moreover,\nbecause an implied finding that Johnson paid for all materials is consistent with the\njudgment, we already presume that the trial court made such a finding.\n\n       We accordingly overrule Johnson\u2019s third issue.\n\n                                    IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Because the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s\nimplied findings in support of the judgment, and because the trial court did not reversibly\nerr in excluding the documentary evidence and additional testimony that Johnson offered\nin support of her claim for damages, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                          /s/    Tracy Christopher\n                                                 Justice\n\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Boyce, Christopher, and Jamison.\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
