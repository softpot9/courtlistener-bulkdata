There is no motion to dismiss the entry of appeal for defects therein.</p>\n<p>While the decree dismisses the bill of complaint as to all parties, the entry of appeal is expressly taken only by \"the plaintiff, M.A. Smith, as General Liquidator of the State Banks of Florida in liquidation, and as Appellant,\" and it is signed by \"solicitors for plaintiff-appellant.\"</p>\n<p>The caption of the entry of appeal is \"David Sholtz, as Governor of the State of Florida, for the use and benefit of M.A. Smith, as Liquidator, <em>et al.,</em> plaintiffs\" which aids in identifying the decree and shows that a use plaintiff is identified with the appeal as taken.</p>\n<p>The assignment of errors shows in the caption and in the text the name of the present Governor of the State of Florida as a use plaintiff-appellant for the use of a named officer, <em>et al.</em></p>\n<p>This being a suit by governmental officials for the benefit of trust funds controlled by the State, and there being a general appearance of appellants by counsel, to an entry of appeal that is legally sufficient to transfer the subject matter of the suit to the appellate court, the appeal will be considered on its merits.
