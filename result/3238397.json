L. 328, &#167; 75.</p>\n<p>The jurisdiction to relieve against forfeitures is founded upon the principle that a party having legal rights shall not be permitted to use them oppressively to the injustice of the defaulting party, but the principle does not extend so far as to authorize a court of equity to set aside the valid stipulations of the parties upon the performance of which their rights depend.

O. B. raft or craft at the mill, viz.: for pine $23.33 1/3, or more per thousand feet, board measure, and for hardwood, $16.66 2/3 per thousand feet, board measure; but should the market price of said lumber at any time fall below such prices, the contractor may, at his election, discontinue operations upon said lands until the products of the mill can be sold for an average of such prices, provided the contractor shall not, on account of the prices, discontinue operations, without the consent of the owner, for more than six consecutive months, nor for more than six months in any one calendar year.</p>\n<p>\"15th.

And to this end the complainant had invested in equipment and labor, large sums of money.</p>\n<p>As a result of the business depression, the demand for lumber had so decreased that it become impossible for the complainant to dispose of the mill's output, or to sell a sufficient amount to pay operating expenses and make prompt payment according to the contract, of what the parties term \"stumpage\" &#8212; that is, defendant's 30 per cent. of the purchase price for lumber sold and collected for &#8212; but all sales and collections were reported.</p>\n<p>The amount due for stumpage on October 10, 1930, reported but not paid, amounted to $2,964.14. To meet this situation, complainant asked defendant, who was engaged in the business of lumber exportation, to purchase a sufficient amount of the lumber on hand to cover this account.</p>\n<p>The defendant did not feel itself obligated to take lumber in payment of stumpage, as the correspondence between the parties set out in the bill shows, but expressed its appreciation of the situation and a willingness \"to be reasonably lenient\" in the matter of payment of \"stumpage money.\"</p>\n<p>This situation continued without change until the report of sales for the month of December was received by defendant showing a balance of $6,488.90 due to defendant for stumpage, and immediately thereafter the defendant, on January 12, 1931, gave the complainant and Hemphill the following notice: \"<em>In</em><em>addition to the liquidated damages provided</em> for in the contract dated February 7th, 1923, and amendments thereto dated March 3rd, 1924, and December 9th, 1924, in the event of a breach thereof, you are now indebted to Hunter-Benn  Company to the amount of $6,488.90. If this entire debt is not paid within five days from this date we will treat the contract as breached, take possession of all the property covered by the mortgage dated July 3rd, 1926, and proceed at once to foreclose said mortgage. You are notified not to sell or dispose of any of the lumber on hand at the plant until the entire amount due is paid. You are further notified to pay over to us our part of the proceeds of lumber which has already been sold.\" (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p>On the same date, defendant notified all of complainant's customers who owed for lumber purchased by them, not to pay their accounts without first obtaining a release from defendant.</p>\n<p>The bill alleges that at this time the accounts outstanding and unpaid for lumber, if complainant had been allowed to collect the same, were sufficient to meet the deficit in the stumpage account and save a forfeiture of the complainant's rights thereunder, and because of the suspension of the right to sell, combined with the interference of the defendant with complainant's right to collect, the complainant was unable to meet the obligation to defendant.</p>\n<p>Thereafter on January 20th defendant declared the contract forfeited, took possession of complainant's plant and all its property, together with the manufactured products of the mill then on the yard, in which the bill avers complainant had invested all of its operating capital, amounting to $50,000 or more.</p>\n<p>At this juncture the complainant filed the original bill, and temporary injunction not being applied for, the defendant proceeded with the foreclosure, selling at public outcry, the sawmill plant, as we take it, including the land upon which the mill was located, and all of complainant's equipment, mules, and other property, which, the bill alleges, at junk prices was worth from sixteen to twenty thousand dollars, purchasing the same at said sale at and for the sum of $1,000.</p>\n<p>We are not of opinion that the appellant's contention that the doors of a court of equity must be closed to the complainant, in the circumstances, because it failed to pay to the defendant the sum of money admitted to be due to the defendant for stumpage, within five days after written notice so to do, should be sustained. There is nothing in the circumstances disclosed by the averments of the bill going to show that the complainant was guilty of fraud, inequitable conduct, or bad faith, in its dealings with the defendant, and defendant's letter of November 5, 1930, while in no sense a modification of the contract, recognized the fact that because of the business depression the defendant was not able to dispose of lumber in sufficient quantities to meet operating expenses and pay in full the amount due for stumpage, and evinced a friendly gesture calculated to induce the belief that the defendant would not, in this respect, insist upon strict compliance with the exacting terms of the contract.</p>\n<p>The facts stated in Ashe-Carson Co. v.

As heretofore stated, the complainant was not a mere agent, but was an independent contractor, not only to cut and manufacture the timber into lumber, but to sell the same and collect the proceeds thereof, and in addition thereto, was with the defendant Hemphill guarantor of the accounts for lumber sold. While by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 222</span> \nterms of the contract between the parties, the defendant retained the legal title to the lumber, until it was sold, it is clear that the equitable ownership to the extent of 70 per cent. of its market value was in the complainant, and after the sale the legal title of the accounts due for lumber sold, and the legal right and duty to collect, vested in the complainant.</p>\n<p>The only provision in the contract authorizing the defendant to withdraw lumber from the power of sale was embodied in paragraph 15, and this was upon condition of payment to the complainant for its interest in the lumber. The contract, therefore, conferred a power of sale coupled with an interest, which could not be suspended or abrogated by the defendant. Chambers v.

Dec. 197; cases cited in note 64 A.L.R. page 380.</p>\n<p>While, as contended by appellant, if the notice given by defendant to suspend the power of sale and collection stood by itself, complainant could have ignored it and proceeded in the exercise of its right, but this notice, coupled with the notice to complainant's customers not to pay their accounts without release from the defendant, disarmed the complainant from pursuing the business of selling and collecting, and, if the averments of the bill represent true facts, prevented the complainant from meeting its obligation to pay within the five days provided by the contract and the notice given in pursuance thereof.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion that the right to terminate the contract because of complainant's failure to pay stumpage embodied in paragraphs 20 and 24 of the contract was modified by the provisions in the mortgage requiring five days' notice as a predicate to the exercise of such power.</p>\n<p>While the jurisdiction of courts of equity to relieve against forfeitures does not justify a disregard of valid stipulations of the parties upon the performance of which their rights depend, yet the rule of general application is that stipulations in contracts intended to work a forfeiture of a valuable right will be strictly construed, and strict compliance therewith by the party claiming the forfeiture will be exacted, and doubtful provisions will be resolved against the right to claim such forfeiture.

The two cases first cited were actions at law and involved private sales. The others were proceedings in equity involving foreclosures by private sales, and in Zadek v. Burnett, supra, the effect of the authorities was \"to hold a mortgagee who sells at private sale responsible and accountable for at least the fair and reasonable value of the property, regardless of the price actually received by him. <em>The rule is,</em><em>of course, less rigid where the sale is at public outcry.</em>\" (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p>\"A sale under a power contained in a mortgage or trust deed is always presumed to be regular and valid, and mere inadequacy in the price bid does not in itself invalidate or affect the sale, otherwise properly conducted, unless it is so great as to shock the conscience of the court, and especially in the absence of a showing that a larger price could be obtained on a resale. If, however, the sum reported is so grossly inadequate as to indicate fraud or a want of reasonable judgment and discretion in the trustee by which the property is sacrificed, the sale may, on timely application, be vacated and a resale ordered, and a court will be particularly inclined to set the sale aside when in addition to inadequacy of price other circumstances exist rendering it inequitable for the sale to stand.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>.
