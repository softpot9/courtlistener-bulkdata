Heino, pro se.\n\n      Will A. Gunn, General Counsel; R. Randall Campbell, Assistant General Counsel; Joan E.\nMoriarty, and Bobbiretta E. Jordan, all of Washington, D.C., were on the brief for the appellee.\n\n       Before HAGEL, MOORMAN, and SCHOELEN, Judges.\n\n       MOORMAN, Judge, filed the opinion of the Court. HAGEL, Judge, filed a separate opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n       MOORMAN, Judge:           The pro se appellant, veteran William H. Heino, appeals a\nDecember 24, 2008, decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) that determined that he is\nobligated to pay VA a copayment for each 30-day or less supply of medication provided by VA on\nan outpatient basis in an amount established under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110. The appellant filed an\ninformal brief, and the Secretary filed a brief. Panel consideration is required to determine whether\n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A, the statute under which the Secretary is required to charge a veteran a copayment\nfor medication (1) allows the Secretary to set a copayment amount that requires veterans to pay the\nsame copayment amount for \"each 30-day supply of medication\" but results in some veterans\nreceiving a supply with fewer pills; and (2) whether 38 C.F.R \u00a7 17.110, the regulation implementing\nsection 1722, interprets the statute's language regarding \"the cost to the Secretary\" in a manner\n\fconsistent with the statute. This appeal is timely, and this Court has jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 7252(a) and 7266(a). For the following reasons, the Court will affirm the Board's December 2008\ndecision.\n\n\n                                              I. BACKGROUND\n         The facts are not in dispute. Mr. Heino has an ongoing prescription for Atenolol pills. He\nis prescribed a 12.5 mg daily dose. The lowest strength available for prescription is dosed in 25 mg\ntablet form. Because the medication is not dispensed in a 12.5 mg tablet, his physician instructed\nhim to split a 25 mg tablet in half to achieve the proper daily dosage. See Record (R.) at 118, 121.\nVA required Mr. Heino to pay a $7 copayment for a 30-day prescription supply of 15 tablets. See\nR. at 118. Mr. Heino complained that he was being overcharged, in light of the fact that he is\nrequired to split his pills, and requested that his copayment charge of $7 be reduced because the\ncopayment amount exceeds the cost to the Secretary to dispense his medication. See R. at 118-19.1\nIn a letter dated February 11, 2005, the VA Office of Regional Counsel determined that the\ncopayment charge of $7 for Mr. Heino's 30-day supply of medication was correct according to\napplicable law and regulation. R. at 118-19 (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110).\nMr. Heino filed a Notice of Disagreement. R. at 104-17. In March 2005, the director of a VA\nmedical center issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) on the issue of the interpretation of section\n1722A, determining that Mr. Heino's copayment for medication should not be decreased to less than\n$7. R. at 91-95. The SOC noted that the decision was based on the regulation implementing section\n1722A, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110, and stated that for the period from February 4, 2002, through\nDecember 31, 2002, the copayment amount is $7. R. at 95.\n         In the December 24, 2008, decision on appeal, the Board discussed the applicable law and\nregulations and concluded that the appellant was required to pay the $7 copayment set forth in the\n\n\n\n\n        1\n           Apparently, this matter was related to a copayment debt that had been referred for VA debt collection. See\nR. at 123. It is not clear from the record of proceedings submitted by the Secretary whether any outstanding copayment\ndebt has been collected.\n\n                                                          2\n\fregulation. Supplemental (Suppl.) R. at 7A-9A.2 The Board found that the Secretary's \"cost of\nfilling [Mr. Heino's] 30-day prescription exceeds the $7 co[]payment established under 38 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 17.110,\" and that, as a matter of law, he was obligated to pay VA the copayment for each 30-day\nsupply of medication provided by VA on an outpatient basis. Id. at 9A.\n\n\n                                                 II. ANALYSIS\n                                             A. Parties' Contentions\n         On appeal, the appellant essentially argues that he is being charged more than other veterans\nsimply because he must split his pills: While he must pay $7 for 15 tablets for a 30-day supply, other\nveterans are charged only $7 for 30, 60, or 90 tablets for their 30-day supply of the same pills.\nAlthough he argues that he is being required to pay more for his pills because he is required to split\nthem, it appears that his argument is that his copayment cost for 30 pills ($14) is more than the\ncopayment cost of other veterans ($7) who receive 30 pills in their 30-day supply. In this regard, he\nmaintains that the Secretary is violating 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(2) because the Secretary requires that\nhe pay a copayment amount \"in excess of the cost to the Secretary\" in dispensing the medication.\nSee Appellant's Informal Brief (Br.) at 2. He asserts that his \"[s]plit pill supplies at the time of\ndispensing, are the same, and have the same actual cost as all other pill supplies.\" Id.\n             The Secretary argues that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A \"clearly requires a co[]payment for 'each\n30-day supply of medication'\" and the supply is \"not based upon the number of pills prescribed\nduring the 30 day period of time.\" Secretary's Br. at 9-10. Relying on the regulatory history of\n38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110, which implements the statute, the Secretary argues that the manner in which VA\ndetermines the copayment is reasonable. Id. at 10-11. The Secretary also reasons that the portion\nof the regulation that increases the medication copayment from $2 per prescription to $7 per\nprescription is justified by the administrative costs associated with dispensing medication and not\n\n         2\n           The Court directed the Secretary to file a supplemental record of proceedings that contained the December 24,\n2008, Board decision on appeal. In response, on March 25, 2011, the Secretary filed a supplemental record of\nproceedings that contained the December 2008 Board decision. However, the Secretary also included the entirety of the\npreviously filed record of proceedings, including the pagination of documents that was used in that submission, and did\nnot include any record pagination for the December 2008 Board decision. Accordingly, to eliminate any confusion, the\nCourt will refer to the first page of the 2008 Board decision as Supplemental Record at 3A, and the succeeding pages\nof the 2008 Board decision as 4A through 9A. (The pagination for the March 2007 Board decision as Record at 3,\ntherefore, remains unchanged.)\n\n                                                           3\n\fsolely the cost of the medication itself.\n                                   B. Applicable Law and Regulation\n        Title 38 of the U.S. Code, section 1722A provides, in pertinent part:\n           (a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall require a veteran to pay the\n        United States $2 for each 30-day supply of medication furnished such veteran under\n        this chapter on an outpatient basis for treatment of a non-service-connected disability\n        or condition. If the amount supplied is less than a 30-day supply, the amount of the\n        charge may not be reduced.\n\n          (2) The Secretary may not require a veteran to pay an amount in excess of the cost\n        to the Secretary for medication described in paragraph (1).\n\n            ....\n\n         (b) The Secretary, pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, may\u2013\n\n                     (1) increase the copayment amount in effect under subsection (a); and\n\n                  (2) establish a maximum monthly and a maximum annual pharmaceutical\n                copayment amount under subsection (a) for veterans who have multiple\n                outpatient prescriptions.\n\n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1722A(a), (b). Subsection (b) of section 1722A, giving the Secretary authority to\nincrease the copayment amount for medications, was added by a 1999 amendment to the statute.\nThe Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, Pub. L. 106-117, Title II, \u00a7 201(a)(2),\n113 Stat. 1560 (Nov. 30, 1999).\n        Effective February 4, 2002, the Secretary promulgated a regulation implementing the statute.\n66 Fed. Reg. 63449-01 (Dec. 6, 2001) (codified at 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110). Before that time, the\nSecretary had not changed the $2 copayment amount for each 30-day or less supply of medication.\nWith the promulgation of the regulation, the Secretary increased the copayment amount from $2 to\n$7. VA's implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110 (\"Copayments for medication\") provided,\nin pertinent part:\n          (a) General. This section sets forth requirements regarding copayments for\n        medications provided to veterans by VA.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f           (b) Copayments. (1) Unless exempted under paragraph (c) of this section\n       [(identifying specific situations\u2013e.g., medication for a veteran's service-connected\n       disability\u2013that are not applicable here)], a veteran is obligated to pay VA a\n       copayment for each 30-day or less supply of medication provided by VA on an\n       outpatient basis (other than medication administered during treatment). For the\n       period from February 4, 2002 through December 31, 2002, the copayment amount\n       is $7. The copayment amount for each calendar year thereafter will be established\n       by using the Prescription Drug component of the Medical Consumer Price Index as\n       follows: For each calendar year beginning after December 31, 2002, the Index as of\n       the previous September 30 will be divided by the Index as of September 30, 2001.\n       The ratio so obtained will be multiplied by the original copayment amount of $7.\n       The copayment amount for the new calendar year will be this result, rounded down\n       to the whole dollar amount.\n\n         NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (B)(1): Example for determining copayment amount. If the\n       ratio of the Prescription Drug component of the Medical Consumer Price Index for\n       September 30, 2003, to the corresponding Index for September 30, 2001, is 1.2242,\n       then this ratio multiplied by the original copayment amount of $7 would equal $8.57,\n       and the copayment amount for calendar year 2004, rounded down to the whole dollar\n       amount, would be $8.\n\n38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 17.110(a), (b) (2002). Accordingly, the regulation provides that any increase in the\ncopayment amount in a given calendar year is determined using calculations based on the\nPrescription Drug component of the Medical Consumer Price Index (hereinafter CPI-P) and as\nprovided in \u00a7 17.110.\n       Effective January 1, 2006, the Secretary increased the medication copayment amount from\n$7 to $8. 70 Fed. Reg. 72326-01 (Dec. 2, 2005).3 In the Notice published in the Federal Register,\nthe Secretary explained that until September 30, 2005, there had been no changes in the ratio used\nto calculate the copayment that resulted in an increase of VA's medication copayment rates. Id. The\nSecretary did not increase the $8 copayment amount in calendar year 2007, 2008, or 2009. See\n\n       3\n           Computation of calendar year 2006 medication co[]payment amount:\n                Prescription Drug Medical Consumer Price Index as of Sept. 30, 2005 = 351.8\n                Prescription Drug Medical Consumer Price Index as of Sept. 30, 2001 = 304.8\n                Index (ratio) = 351.8 divided by 304.8 = 1.1542\n                Index (ratio) of 1.1542 x $7 = $8.08\n                Co[]payment amount = $8.00\n\n       70 Fed. Reg. 72326-01.\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\f72 Fed. Reg. 4773-01 (Feb. 1, 2007) (Notice); 73 Fed. Reg. 1914-02 (Jan. 10, 2008) (Notice);\n73 Fed. Reg. 75494-02 (Dec. 11, 2008) (Notice).\n       Thereafter, the Secretary \"froze\" copayments at the $8 rate for the period January 1, 2010,\nthrough June 30, 2010, to give VA time \"to determine whether the current methodology for\nestablishing copayment amounts, consistent with [VA] responsibility under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A to\nrequire a copayment in order to control health-care costs, is appropriate for all veterans.\"\n74 Fed. Reg. 69283-01 (Dec. 31, 2009) (interim rule); 75 Fed. Reg. 32668-01 (June 9, 2010) (final\nrule). By interim final rule, the Secretary has extended the \"freeze\" on the copayment amount of $8\nuntil January 1, 2012, for veterans in VA health care system enrollment categories 2 through 6 and\nincreased copayments as required by the current regulation only for veterans in priority categories\n7 and 8. 75 Fed. Reg. 32670-01 (June 9, 2010) (interim final rule) (codified at 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110\n(2010) (revising paragraph (b)(1) to require either a $8 or $9 copayment amount depending on a\nveteran's priority category)). It appears that the appellant here is in priority category 5. See R. at\n123.\n                 C. Statutory Interpretation and Reasonableness of the Regulation\n                                  1. Interpreting \"30-day supply\"\n       The appellant does not challenge the Board's findings that (1) he is not exempt from a\ncopayment in association with his VA prescribed medication; (2) he is not service connected for any\ndisability; and (3) he was charged the standard copayment authorized under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110 for\nhis VA-prescribed medication. Suppl. R. at 8A. The Board noted the appellant's argument that his\n$7 copayment is excessive and in violation of section 1722A based on his assertion that he is\nrequired to split 15 tablets in half for a 30-day supply while other veterans receive more than 15\ntablets for their 30-day supply. Relying on the VA Regional Counsel's February 2005 letter, which\nin turn relied on the regulatory history of \u00a7 17.110, the Board determined that the appellant was\nobligated to pay VA the copayment for each 30-day or less supply of medication, which was\nprescribed by his physician, established by VA regulation \u00a7 17.110. The Secretary asserts that the\ncopayment is consistent with the regulation and the statute. He argues that the statutory language\n\"clearly requires a co[]payment for 'each 30[-]day supply of medication\" and that the \"supply is not\nbased upon the number of pills prescribed during that 30[-]day period of time.\" Secretary's Br. at\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f9-10.\n        To assess the reasonableness of the Secretary's regulation and its consistency with the statute,\n\"the first inquiry is whether the applicable statute provides a clear statement of congressional intent\non point.\" Sears v. Principi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784234\"><a href=\"/opinion/784234/marian-sears-claimant-appellant-v-anthony-j-principi-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Supreme Court has stated:\n        If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well\n        as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress\n        . . . . if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the\n        question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible\n        construction of the statute.\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Counsel, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842-43 (1984).\n        The Court agrees with the Secretary that the statutory language is clear as to the meaning of\na \"30-day supply.\" The appellant's argument that his participation in splitting the pills warrants\nspecial consideration is misplaced because the statute and regulation are clear that, irrespective of\nthe type of medication and dosage, a 30-day supply of medication requires a full copayment, which\nwas $7 at the time the appellant was charged the copayment. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A; 38 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 17.110. In requiring a copayment for a 30-day supply, the focus of the statutory language is on\ntime, not dosage. In other words, the statute does not require a copayment for 30 doses of\nmedication, but rather for a 30-day supply of medication\u2013regardless of the dosage prescribed for the\n30-day period. If the appellant's prescription called for 50 mg per day, his 30-day supply of\nmedication would consist of 60 pills (assuming the pills are only available in 25 mg form). The\nappellant's prescription, however, calls for 12.5 mg per day. Because the smallest dosage of his\nmedication is 25 mg, his 30-day supply of medication consists of 15 pills. His participation in\nsplitting the pills does not change the fact that he is receiving the prescribed supply of medication\nfor a 30-day period and thus must pay the requisite copayment for that 30-day supply.\n        Moreover, the statute expressly provides that \"[i]f the amount supplied is less than a 30-day\nsupply, the amount of the charge may not be reduced.\" 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(1). The regulation\nis consistent with this statutory language. See 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110(b)(1) (\"a veteran is obligated to\npay VA a copayment for each 30-day or less supply of medication\") (emphasis added). This\nlanguage demonstrates that Congress recognized that prescriptions for shorter periods of time should\nbe subject to the same copayment amount; thus a veteran with a 7-day prescription must pay the\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fsame copayment as a veteran with a 30-day prescription. This further bolsters the Secretary's\nargument that the appellant is not entitled to a reduction in the copayment amount simply because\nhe is receiving only 15 pills. The statutory and regulatory language reinforce the general intent that\nthe copayment is linked to the veteran's prescription (\"supply\") and not the number of pills provided.\nThe Court finds that the statutory language is clear and unambiguous on this point, and that the\nSecretary's interpretation of the statute is consistent with this language.\n                              2. Interpreting \"cost to the Secretary\"\n       The more critical question before the Court is whether the Secretary's regulation that\nincreased the copayment to $7 for each 30-day supply of medication is reasonable and whether the\nregulation is consistent with the requirement in section 1722A(a)(2) that provides \"[t]he Secretary\nmay not require a veteran to pay an amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for medication\ndescribed in paragraph (1).\" Paragraph (1) sets the copayment as $2 \"for each 30-day supply of\nmedication furnished\" to the veteran. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(1). Section 1722A(b)(1) specifically\nprovides that the Secretary shall prescribe regulations that may increase the copayment amount in\neffect under subsection (a). The appellant argues that the regulation, however, conflicts with the\nprovision in the statute that requires that the copayment amount not exceed the cost to the Secretary\nfor medication described \u00a71722A(a). The Secretary asserts that the \"cost to the Secretary for\nmedication\" includes VA's costs \"for dispensing a prescription.\" Secretary's Br. at 11. The Board\nhad determined that, based on a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) study cited in the regulatory\nhistory, it was clear \"that VA's cost of filling the veteran's 30-day prescription exceeds the $7\nco[]payment established under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110.\" Suppl. R. at 9A.\n       Again, as above, the Court looks to the statutory language to determine whether the\nSecretary's regulation is reasonable and consistent with the statute. Chevron and Sears, both supra.\nThe Court must, therefore, determine whether the statutory language allows the Secretary to include\nhis administrative costs in calculating the \"cost to the Secretary\" for the medication provided to the\nveteran.\n       The Court holds that the statutory language does not clearly speak to this precise question.\nThe \"cost to the Secretary for medication\" can be construed as being limited to the cost VA paid for\nthe actual medication only or can be interpreted as including the Secretary's costs in dispensing the\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fmedication, i.e., his administrative costs. Because \"the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect\nto the specific issue,\" the Court must determine whether the Secretary's interpretation is reasonable.\nChevron, 467 U.S. at 843. An \"'agency that has been granted authority to promulgate regulations\nnecessary to the administration of a program it oversees may fill in gaps in the statutory scheme left\nby Congress.'\" Sears, 349 F.3d at 1329 (quoting Contreras v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769141\"><a href=\"/opinion/769141/paul-l-contreras-and-arnoldus-janssen-v-united-states-paul-l-contreras/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1274\n(Fed. Cir. 2000)). An agency's gap-filling regulation must be upheld if it is reasonable and consistent\nwith the statutory framework. Id. We hold that the Secretary's interpretation of the statute\u2013as\nexpressed in the regulation at issue here, 38 C.F.R.\u00a7 17.110 (2002-2009)\u2013is reasonable and\nconsistent with the statute. Our holding is supported by both the regulatory and statutory history,\nas well as the statutory framework.\n          In the 2001 proposed rulemaking, the Secretary explained the increase in the copayment\namount from $2 to $7 through December 31, 2002, as well as the establishment of escalator\nprovisions to automatically increase the copayment amount. 66 Fed. Reg. at 36961. The Secretary\nstated:\n          Based on a review of industry standards, we believe that the medication copayment\n          should be increased from $2 to $7. We believe that the proposed $7 medication\n          copayment would be lower than or equal to most medication copayments charged by\n          the private health care industry. Further we believe it is a reasonable amount for the\n          majority of medications dispensed.\n\n          Also, under 38 U.S.C. 1722A, VA may not require a veteran to pay an amount in\n          excess of the actual cost of the medication and the pharmacy administrative costs\n          related to the dispensing of the medication. VHA conducted a study of the pharmacy\n          administrative costs relating to the dispensing of medication on an outpatient basis\n          and found that VA incurred a cost of $7.28 to dispense an outpatient medication even\n          without consideration of the actual cost of the medication. This amount covers the\n          cost of consultation time, filling time, dispensing time, an appropriate share of the\n          direct and indirect personnel costs, physical overhead and materials, and supply\n          costs. Under these circumstances, we believe that a $7 copayment would not exceed\n          VA's costs.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n          In proposing the escalator provisions for the copayment amount, the Secretary explained that\nthis is \"to ensure that the copayment amounts increase with inflation.\" Id. The Secretary stated:\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\f        Also, increasing the copayment amount in whole dollar increments would be easily\n        understood by veterans and lessen the administrative burden on VA. Further, based\n        on commensurate increased costs to VA, we believe that VA's costs would remain\n        higher than the increases made by the escalator provisions.\n\nId. In adopting the proposed rule as the final rule without any changes, the Secretary noted that the\n1999 amendment to the statute to specifically authorize VA to increase the copayment amount\nshowed that \"the statutory intent was for VA to increase the copayment amount.\" 66 Fed. Reg. at\n63449. In its final rule, the Secretary noted certain legislative history for the 1999 amendment to\nsection 1722A that added subsection (b):\n        In helping VA to determine the amount of the copayment, the House Conference\n        Report (H. Rept. 106-237, July 16, 1999) specifically noted that the copayment for\n        DOD's Tricare Prime Plan included a $9 copayment for each 30-day prescription.\n        Further, the House Conference Report indicated at page 42, that \"[a] survey of\n        copayment trends in 1996-7 found the most common [prescription drug] copayment\n        among members of the American Association of Health Plans . . . [to be] in the range\n        of $5 to $10 per prescription.\"\n\nId. Notably, the Secretary declined to make any change to its proposed rule based on a commenter\nwho suggested that the copayment amount should vary based on geographic location. The Secretary\nnoted: \"We do not believe that this would be administratively feasible.\" Id. at 63450.\n        The same House Conference Report cited by the Secretary in his commentary to the final\nrule, noted above, also contains additional support for the Secretary's interpretation of the statute as\nallowing VA to include administrative costs in calculating the copayment amount. For instance, the\nHouse Report stated the following when discussing the need of VA to enhance revenues: \"In the\nCommittee's view, authorizing the Secretary to set reasonable copayment increases on prescription\ndrugs is a reasonable policy in the face of VA's mounting pharmaceutical costs\u2013approaching $2\nbillion annually. Notwithstanding an aggressive pharmacy benefits management policy, VA's\npharmacy costs have nearly doubled since copayments were instituted some nine years ago.\" H.R.\nRep. No. 106-237, Title II, \u00a7 201, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. (July 16, 1999) (to accompany H.R. 2116).\n        In addition to being supported by the legislative history, the Secretary's regulation is\nconsistent with the statutory framework. See Meeks v.

SINGER,\nSUTHERLAND ON STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION \u00a7 46.05 (5th ed. 1992)). A practical result of the\nregulation was to clearly define the words \"cost to the Secretary for medication\" in\nsection 1722A(a)(2) as comprising both the cost of the medication plus the administrative costs\nassociated with dispensing the medication. In section 1722A(a)(2), Congress specifically pointed\nback to section 1722A(a)(1) for a description of the term \"medication.\" Section 1722A(a)(1)\ndescribes the medication as a \"30-day supply of medication furnished\" the veteran. 38 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1722A(a)(1) (emphasis added). So, \"[t]he Secretary may not require a veteran to pay an amount\nin excess of the cost to the Secretary for [each 30-day supply of medication furnished]\" to the\nveteran. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a). The term \"supply\" is defined as \"an amount or quantity available\nfor use.\" WEBSTER'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY 1345 (3d ed. 1988). The term \"furnish\" means \"to\nsupply, provide, or equip with whatever is necessary or useful\" and \"implies the provision of all the\nthings requisite for a particular service, action, etc. [to furnish a house].\" Id. at 547. Thus, it appears\nthat the statutory terms describing the medication contemplate more than the cost of the pills\nthemselves. The costs of furnishing the 30-day supply of the medication implies that the cost of the\nmedication also includes the costs incurred for providing or getting the pills into the hands of the\nveterans\u2014the administrative costs associated with dispensing of the medication.\n        Moreover, Congress has indirectly indicated that it sanctions the Secretary's method of\nincreasing the copayment for medications furnished to veterans on an outpatient basis for the\ntreatment of a non-service-connected disability or condition. In 2002, the Secretary determined that\nVA was factoring in the administrative costs in its calculation of the copayment amount. In the nine\nyears since the promulgation of the Secretary's regulation, Congress has had ample opportunity to\nchange the way the Secretary has proceeded in this matter, but Congress has declined to do so.\nInstead, in 2003, Congress enacted revisions to the same statute that gives the Secretary authority\nto increase the copayment amount, but did nothing to reject or alter the Secretary's construction of\nthe statute or circumscribe the Secretary's regulation establishing the manner in which he increases\nthe copayment for medications. Specifically, the Court notes that the language in paragraphs 1 and\n2 of section 1722A(a), as relevant here, has remained the same since its enactment as section 622A\n\n\n\n\n                                                    11\n\fin November 1990.4 Significantly, after the Secretary issued his regulation in February 2002\n(\u00a717.110), which for the first time increased the statutory $2 copayment amount for each 30-day or\nless supply of medication, which increase was based in part on administrative costs related to the\ndispensing of the medication, Congress twice amended section 1722A: In February 2003, Congress\namended subsections (c) and (d) of section 1722A.5 And in December 2003, Congress amended\nsubsection (a)(3) of section 1722A regarding those veterans who are not required to pay a copayment\nfor medications.6\n         Despite Congress's consideration of this statute and its provisions twice in 2003, Congress\ndid not change subsection (b) regarding the authority Congress previously gave the Secretary to\nincrease the copayment amount for medications under subsection (a). Congress twice had the\nopportunity to object to the Secretary's regulation that increased the copayment for medications,\nincluding the considerations used by the Secretary for the increase, and did not do so.

I write separately, however, to express my disagreement with the\nmajority's conclusion that the phrase \"cost to the Secretary for medication,\" as used in section\n1722A(a)(2), is susceptible to more than one interpretation.\n       The majority concludes that the phrase \"cost to the Secretary for medication\" contained in\nsection 1722A(a)(2) is ambiguous in that it \"can be construed as limited to the cost VA paid for\nactual medication only or can be interpreted as including the Secretary's costs in dispensing the\nmedication, i.e., his administrative costs.\" Majority Opinion at ___. I would conclude that this\nlanguage is clear, unambiguous, and cannot be construed as including costs incurred by the Secretary\nin dispensing the medication.\n       \"The starting point in interpreting a statute is its language, for '[i]f the intent of Congress is\nclear, that is the end of the matter.'\" Good Samaritan Hosp. v.

See Talley v. Derwinski, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vet. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n286 (1992) ( holding that \"[e]ach part or section [of a statute] should be construed in connection with\nevery other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole\" (citation omitted; internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). In relevant part, section 1722A(a)(1) provides that \"the Secretary shall require a\nveteran to pay the United States $2 for each 30-day supply of medication furnished such veteran\nunder this chapter on an outpatient basis for the treatment of a non-service-connected disability or\ncondition. . . .\" 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(1) (emphasis added). Accordingly, when these provisions are\nread together, section 1722A(a)(2) clearly prevents the Secretary from \"requir[ing] a veteran to pay\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fan amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for [each 30-day supply of medication furnished\nsuch veteran under this chapter on an outpatient basis for the treatment of a non-service-connected\ndisability or condition].\" 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a).\n       Nowhere in this statutory interplay is there a reference to administrative costs incurred by the\nSecretary in dispensing the veteran's 30-day supply of medication, costs that are wholly apart from\nthe cost to the Secretary for the medication itself. Congress could, of course, have included language\nin the statute prohibiting the Secretary from requiring a veteran to pay more than the cost to the\nSecretary for the medication plus the cost of the Secretary's overhead for dispensing that medication.\nTo this end, it is notable that in 2002, when Congress first authorized VA to increase the $2\ncopayment found in section 1722A(a)(1) by adding subsection (b), it did not, in any way, alter the\nlanguage of section 1722A(a)(2). See The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, Pub.\nL. 106-117, Title II, \u00a7 201(a)(2), 113 Stat. 1560 (Nov. 30, 1999). Certainly, if Congress wished to\nallow VA to pass on rising administrative and pharmacy costs to veterans by virtue of increased\ncopayments for medication furnished to them, it could have done so by removing subsection (a)(2)\nof section 1722A or adding language to that subsection that contemplated such costs. As it did not\ndo so, however, I believe the meaning of the statutory language, and therefore Congress's intent, is\nclear and does not contemplate such administrative costs. Accordingly I would determine that this\n\"is the end of the matter\" and that both the Court and VA \"must give effect to the unambiguously\nexpressed intent of Congress,\" which is to prohibit the Secretary from charging a veteran a\ncopayment for a 30-day supply of medication in excess of the cost to the Secretary for that\nmedication. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842.\n       To be clear, I find no conflict between the past and present versions of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110\nand section 1722A. By amending section 1722A to add subsection (b), Congress clearly empowered\nVA to promulgate regulations increasing the copayment charged to veterans, previously set by statute\nat $2. Further, because, in section 1722A(a)(1), Congress initially established a blanket copayment\nof $2 to be paid by all such veterans, regardless of the type or amount of medication furnished, it\ncannot be said that VA acted unreasonably by maintaining a blanket copayment when it promulgated\n\u00a7 17.110 in 2002. Nevertheless, pursuant to the plain language of section 1722A(a)(2), any\ncopayment for which a veteran would ordinarily be responsible pursuant to section 1722(a)(1) and\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f\u00a7 17.110 must be reduced when that amount would be in excess of the cost to the Secretary for the\n30-day supply of medication furnished to the veteran, regardless of the type of medication or dose\nprescribed.\n       In the present case, because the appellant is required to split his Atenolol tablets to obtain the\ndesired dose, his 30-day supply of medication is 15 tablets. He argues that, by requiring him to pay\nthe full copayment amount established by \u00a7 17.110 ($7 from February 4, 2002, to December 31,\n2005, and $8 thereafter), VA is violating section 1722A(a)(2) by charging him more than the cost\nof this medication to the Secretary. Inherent in this argument is the appellant's contention that the\nSecretary pays less for 15 Atenolol tablets than VA has required him to pay (previously $7, now $8)\nas a coypayment.\n       The appellant also made this argument on appeal to the Board. See Supplemental R. at 8\n(\"The Board additionally notes that the veteran has repeatedly asserted that the cost of $7 for his\nco[]payment is excessive and in violation of 38 U.S.C.[] \u00a7 1722A.\"). In dismissing this argument,\nthe Board relied on the Veterans Health Administration study of VA's pharmacy administrative costs\nthat was referenced by the Secretary in the 2001 proposed rulemaking that ultimately led to the\npromulgation of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110 (2002). As noted in the majority opinion, that study found that\n\"VA incurred a cost of $7.28 to dispense an outpatient medication even without consideration of the\nactual cost of the medication.\" 66 Fed. Reg. 36,960, 36,961 (2001) (emphasis added). The Board\nreasoned that, because the study indicated that VA incurs a $7.28 administrative cost every time it\ndispenses medication on an outpatient basis, \"it [is] clear that VA's cost of filling the [appellant's]\n30-day prescription exceeds the $7 co[]payment established under \u00a7 17.110.\" Supplemental R. at\n9. Implicit in this reasoning is that the Board interpreted section 1722A(a)(2) as including the\nSecretary's administrative costs associated with dispensing the medication as part of the cost of the\nmedication to the Secretary.\n       When a pure question of law, such as the interpretation of a statute, is at issue, the Court\nreviews the conclusions of the Board de novo, without deference. Smith v. Gober, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vet. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n230 (2000). As explained above, after reviewing the language of section 1722A, I would conclude\nthat the plain and unambiguous language of subsection (a)(2) prohibits the Secretary from requiring\na veteran to pay an amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for each 30-day supply of\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fmedication furnished to him or her, without regard to the administrative costs incurred by the\nSecretary in actually dispensing such medication. I would therefore conclude that the Board's\ninterpretation of that provision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\naccordance with the law. See Kent v. Principi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788440\"><a href=\"/opinion/788440/peter-r-kent-claimant-appellant-v-anthony-j-principi-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1380</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1384 (2004) (holding that the\n\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law\" standard\nof review \"contemplates de novo review of questions of law\"). Accordingly, I would set aside the\nBoard's December 2008 decision to the extent that it concluded that the appellant's copayment was\nnot excessive under section 1722A(a)(2) and would remand the matter for further development and\nreadjudication consistent with a proper interpretation of section 1722A(a)(2).\n       Lastly, I understand that some might say that the interpretation that I express would place\nan unnecessary accounting burden on VA. The calculation that I believe the statute requires VA to\nmake in these instances is, however, routinely made up front by private pharmacies when\ndetermining the profit margin sought on each drug dispensed to their customers. Thus, I do not\nbelieve that such a calculation places an unreasonable burden on VA. As a result, I do not believe\nthat my interpretation of section 1722A produces an absurd result.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  17\n\f</pre>", "Case_Text": "          UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS\n\n\n                                            NO . 09-112\n\n                               WILLIAM H.

Heino, pro se.\n\n      Will A. Gunn, General Counsel; R. Randall Campbell, Assistant General Counsel; Joan E.\nMoriarty, and Bobbiretta E. Jordan, all of Washington, D.C., were on the brief for the appellee.\n\n       Before HAGEL, MOORMAN, and SCHOELEN, Judges.\n\n       MOORMAN, Judge, filed the opinion of the Court. HAGEL, Judge, filed a separate opinion\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n       MOORMAN, Judge:           The pro se appellant, veteran William H. Heino, appeals a\nDecember 24, 2008, decision of the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) that determined that he is\nobligated to pay VA a copayment for each 30-day or less supply of medication provided by VA on\nan outpatient basis in an amount established under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110. The appellant filed an\ninformal brief, and the Secretary filed a brief. Panel consideration is required to determine whether\n38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A, the statute under which the Secretary is required to charge a veteran a copayment\nfor medication (1) allows the Secretary to set a copayment amount that requires veterans to pay the\nsame copayment amount for \"each 30-day supply of medication\" but results in some veterans\nreceiving a supply with fewer pills; and (2) whether 38 C.F.R \u00a7 17.110, the regulation implementing\nsection 1722, interprets the statute's language regarding \"the cost to the Secretary\" in a manner\n\fconsistent with the statute. This appeal is timely, and this Court has jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 7252(a) and 7266(a). For the following reasons, the Court will affirm the Board's December 2008\ndecision.\n\n\n                                              I. BACKGROUND\n         The facts are not in dispute. Mr. Heino has an ongoing prescription for Atenolol pills. He\nis prescribed a 12.5 mg daily dose. The lowest strength available for prescription is dosed in 25 mg\ntablet form. Because the medication is not dispensed in a 12.5 mg tablet, his physician instructed\nhim to split a 25 mg tablet in half to achieve the proper daily dosage. See Record (R.) at 118, 121.\nVA required Mr. Heino to pay a $7 copayment for a 30-day prescription supply of 15 tablets. See\nR. at 118. Mr. Heino complained that he was being overcharged, in light of the fact that he is\nrequired to split his pills, and requested that his copayment charge of $7 be reduced because the\ncopayment amount exceeds the cost to the Secretary to dispense his medication. See R. at 118-19.1\nIn a letter dated February 11, 2005, the VA Office of Regional Counsel determined that the\ncopayment charge of $7 for Mr. Heino's 30-day supply of medication was correct according to\napplicable law and regulation. R. at 118-19 (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110).\nMr. Heino filed a Notice of Disagreement. R. at 104-17. In March 2005, the director of a VA\nmedical center issued a Statement of the Case (SOC) on the issue of the interpretation of section\n1722A, determining that Mr. Heino's copayment for medication should not be decreased to less than\n$7. R. at 91-95. The SOC noted that the decision was based on the regulation implementing section\n1722A, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110, and stated that for the period from February 4, 2002, through\nDecember 31, 2002, the copayment amount is $7. R. at 95.\n         In the December 24, 2008, decision on appeal, the Board discussed the applicable law and\nregulations and concluded that the appellant was required to pay the $7 copayment set forth in the\n\n\n\n\n        1\n           Apparently, this matter was related to a copayment debt that had been referred for VA debt collection. See\nR. at 123. It is not clear from the record of proceedings submitted by the Secretary whether any outstanding copayment\ndebt has been collected.\n\n                                                          2\n\fregulation. Supplemental (Suppl.) R. at 7A-9A.2 The Board found that the Secretary's \"cost of\nfilling [Mr. Heino's] 30-day prescription exceeds the $7 co[]payment established under 38 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 17.110,\" and that, as a matter of law, he was obligated to pay VA the copayment for each 30-day\nsupply of medication provided by VA on an outpatient basis. Id. at 9A.\n\n\n                                                 II. ANALYSIS\n                                             A. Parties' Contentions\n         On appeal, the appellant essentially argues that he is being charged more than other veterans\nsimply because he must split his pills: While he must pay $7 for 15 tablets for a 30-day supply, other\nveterans are charged only $7 for 30, 60, or 90 tablets for their 30-day supply of the same pills.\nAlthough he argues that he is being required to pay more for his pills because he is required to split\nthem, it appears that his argument is that his copayment cost for 30 pills ($14) is more than the\ncopayment cost of other veterans ($7) who receive 30 pills in their 30-day supply. In this regard, he\nmaintains that the Secretary is violating 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(2) because the Secretary requires that\nhe pay a copayment amount \"in excess of the cost to the Secretary\" in dispensing the medication.\nSee Appellant's Informal Brief (Br.) at 2. He asserts that his \"[s]plit pill supplies at the time of\ndispensing, are the same, and have the same actual cost as all other pill supplies.\" Id.\n             The Secretary argues that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A \"clearly requires a co[]payment for 'each\n30-day supply of medication'\" and the supply is \"not based upon the number of pills prescribed\nduring the 30 day period of time.\" Secretary's Br. at 9-10. Relying on the regulatory history of\n38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110, which implements the statute, the Secretary argues that the manner in which VA\ndetermines the copayment is reasonable. Id. at 10-11. The Secretary also reasons that the portion\nof the regulation that increases the medication copayment from $2 per prescription to $7 per\nprescription is justified by the administrative costs associated with dispensing medication and not\n\n         2\n           The Court directed the Secretary to file a supplemental record of proceedings that contained the December 24,\n2008, Board decision on appeal. In response, on March 25, 2011, the Secretary filed a supplemental record of\nproceedings that contained the December 2008 Board decision. However, the Secretary also included the entirety of the\npreviously filed record of proceedings, including the pagination of documents that was used in that submission, and did\nnot include any record pagination for the December 2008 Board decision. Accordingly, to eliminate any confusion, the\nCourt will refer to the first page of the 2008 Board decision as Supplemental Record at 3A, and the succeeding pages\nof the 2008 Board decision as 4A through 9A. (The pagination for the March 2007 Board decision as Record at 3,\ntherefore, remains unchanged.)\n\n                                                           3\n\fsolely the cost of the medication itself.\n                                   B. Applicable Law and Regulation\n        Title 38 of the U.S. Code, section 1722A provides, in pertinent part:\n           (a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall require a veteran to pay the\n        United States $2 for each 30-day supply of medication furnished such veteran under\n        this chapter on an outpatient basis for treatment of a non-service-connected disability\n        or condition. If the amount supplied is less than a 30-day supply, the amount of the\n        charge may not be reduced.\n\n          (2) The Secretary may not require a veteran to pay an amount in excess of the cost\n        to the Secretary for medication described in paragraph (1).\n\n            ....\n\n         (b) The Secretary, pursuant to regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, may\u2013\n\n                     (1) increase the copayment amount in effect under subsection (a); and\n\n                  (2) establish a maximum monthly and a maximum annual pharmaceutical\n                copayment amount under subsection (a) for veterans who have multiple\n                outpatient prescriptions.\n\n38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1722A(a), (b). Subsection (b) of section 1722A, giving the Secretary authority to\nincrease the copayment amount for medications, was added by a 1999 amendment to the statute.\nThe Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, Pub. L. 106-117, Title II, \u00a7 201(a)(2),\n113 Stat. 1560 (Nov. 30, 1999).\n        Effective February 4, 2002, the Secretary promulgated a regulation implementing the statute.\n66 Fed. Reg. 63449-01 (Dec. 6, 2001) (codified at 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110). Before that time, the\nSecretary had not changed the $2 copayment amount for each 30-day or less supply of medication.\nWith the promulgation of the regulation, the Secretary increased the copayment amount from $2 to\n$7. VA's implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110 (\"Copayments for medication\") provided,\nin pertinent part:\n          (a) General. This section sets forth requirements regarding copayments for\n        medications provided to veterans by VA.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f           (b) Copayments. (1) Unless exempted under paragraph (c) of this section\n       [(identifying specific situations\u2013e.g., medication for a veteran's service-connected\n       disability\u2013that are not applicable here)], a veteran is obligated to pay VA a\n       copayment for each 30-day or less supply of medication provided by VA on an\n       outpatient basis (other than medication administered during treatment). For the\n       period from February 4, 2002 through December 31, 2002, the copayment amount\n       is $7. The copayment amount for each calendar year thereafter will be established\n       by using the Prescription Drug component of the Medical Consumer Price Index as\n       follows: For each calendar year beginning after December 31, 2002, the Index as of\n       the previous September 30 will be divided by the Index as of September 30, 2001.\n       The ratio so obtained will be multiplied by the original copayment amount of $7.\n       The copayment amount for the new calendar year will be this result, rounded down\n       to the whole dollar amount.\n\n         NOTE TO PARAGRAPH (B)(1): Example for determining copayment amount. If the\n       ratio of the Prescription Drug component of the Medical Consumer Price Index for\n       September 30, 2003, to the corresponding Index for September 30, 2001, is 1.2242,\n       then this ratio multiplied by the original copayment amount of $7 would equal $8.57,\n       and the copayment amount for calendar year 2004, rounded down to the whole dollar\n       amount, would be $8.\n\n38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 17.110(a), (b) (2002). Accordingly, the regulation provides that any increase in the\ncopayment amount in a given calendar year is determined using calculations based on the\nPrescription Drug component of the Medical Consumer Price Index (hereinafter CPI-P) and as\nprovided in \u00a7 17.110.\n       Effective January 1, 2006, the Secretary increased the medication copayment amount from\n$7 to $8. 70 Fed. Reg. 72326-01 (Dec. 2, 2005).3 In the Notice published in the Federal Register,\nthe Secretary explained that until September 30, 2005, there had been no changes in the ratio used\nto calculate the copayment that resulted in an increase of VA's medication copayment rates. Id. The\nSecretary did not increase the $8 copayment amount in calendar year 2007, 2008, or 2009. See\n\n       3\n           Computation of calendar year 2006 medication co[]payment amount:\n                Prescription Drug Medical Consumer Price Index as of Sept. 30, 2005 = 351.8\n                Prescription Drug Medical Consumer Price Index as of Sept. 30, 2001 = 304.8\n                Index (ratio) = 351.8 divided by 304.8 = 1.1542\n                Index (ratio) of 1.1542 x $7 = $8.08\n                Co[]payment amount = $8.00\n\n       70 Fed. Reg. 72326-01.\n\n\n\n                                                       5\n\f72 Fed. Reg. 4773-01 (Feb. 1, 2007) (Notice); 73 Fed. Reg. 1914-02 (Jan. 10, 2008) (Notice);\n73 Fed. Reg. 75494-02 (Dec. 11, 2008) (Notice).\n       Thereafter, the Secretary \"froze\" copayments at the $8 rate for the period January 1, 2010,\nthrough June 30, 2010, to give VA time \"to determine whether the current methodology for\nestablishing copayment amounts, consistent with [VA] responsibility under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A to\nrequire a copayment in order to control health-care costs, is appropriate for all veterans.\"\n74 Fed. Reg. 69283-01 (Dec. 31, 2009) (interim rule); 75 Fed. Reg. 32668-01 (June 9, 2010) (final\nrule). By interim final rule, the Secretary has extended the \"freeze\" on the copayment amount of $8\nuntil January 1, 2012, for veterans in VA health care system enrollment categories 2 through 6 and\nincreased copayments as required by the current regulation only for veterans in priority categories\n7 and 8. 75 Fed. Reg. 32670-01 (June 9, 2010) (interim final rule) (codified at 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110\n(2010) (revising paragraph (b)(1) to require either a $8 or $9 copayment amount depending on a\nveteran's priority category)). It appears that the appellant here is in priority category 5. See R. at\n123.\n                 C. Statutory Interpretation and Reasonableness of the Regulation\n                                  1. Interpreting \"30-day supply\"\n       The appellant does not challenge the Board's findings that (1) he is not exempt from a\ncopayment in association with his VA prescribed medication; (2) he is not service connected for any\ndisability; and (3) he was charged the standard copayment authorized under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110 for\nhis VA-prescribed medication. Suppl. R. at 8A. The Board noted the appellant's argument that his\n$7 copayment is excessive and in violation of section 1722A based on his assertion that he is\nrequired to split 15 tablets in half for a 30-day supply while other veterans receive more than 15\ntablets for their 30-day supply. Relying on the VA Regional Counsel's February 2005 letter, which\nin turn relied on the regulatory history of \u00a7 17.110, the Board determined that the appellant was\nobligated to pay VA the copayment for each 30-day or less supply of medication, which was\nprescribed by his physician, established by VA regulation \u00a7 17.110. The Secretary asserts that the\ncopayment is consistent with the regulation and the statute. He argues that the statutory language\n\"clearly requires a co[]payment for 'each 30[-]day supply of medication\" and that the \"supply is not\nbased upon the number of pills prescribed during that 30[-]day period of time.\" Secretary's Br. at\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f9-10.\n        To assess the reasonableness of the Secretary's regulation and its consistency with the statute,\n\"the first inquiry is whether the applicable statute provides a clear statement of congressional intent\non point.\" Sears v. Principi, 349 F.3d 1326, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The Supreme Court has stated:\n        If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well\n        as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress\n        . . . . if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the\n        question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible\n        construction of the statute.\n\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Counsel, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).\n        The Court agrees with the Secretary that the statutory language is clear as to the meaning of\na \"30-day supply.\" The appellant's argument that his participation in splitting the pills warrants\nspecial consideration is misplaced because the statute and regulation are clear that, irrespective of\nthe type of medication and dosage, a 30-day supply of medication requires a full copayment, which\nwas $7 at the time the appellant was charged the copayment. See 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A; 38 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 17.110. In requiring a copayment for a 30-day supply, the focus of the statutory language is on\ntime, not dosage. In other words, the statute does not require a copayment for 30 doses of\nmedication, but rather for a 30-day supply of medication\u2013regardless of the dosage prescribed for the\n30-day period. If the appellant's prescription called for 50 mg per day, his 30-day supply of\nmedication would consist of 60 pills (assuming the pills are only available in 25 mg form). The\nappellant's prescription, however, calls for 12.5 mg per day. Because the smallest dosage of his\nmedication is 25 mg, his 30-day supply of medication consists of 15 pills. His participation in\nsplitting the pills does not change the fact that he is receiving the prescribed supply of medication\nfor a 30-day period and thus must pay the requisite copayment for that 30-day supply.\n        Moreover, the statute expressly provides that \"[i]f the amount supplied is less than a 30-day\nsupply, the amount of the charge may not be reduced.\" 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(1). The regulation\nis consistent with this statutory language. See 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110(b)(1) (\"a veteran is obligated to\npay VA a copayment for each 30-day or less supply of medication\") (emphasis added). This\nlanguage demonstrates that Congress recognized that prescriptions for shorter periods of time should\nbe subject to the same copayment amount; thus a veteran with a 7-day prescription must pay the\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fsame copayment as a veteran with a 30-day prescription. This further bolsters the Secretary's\nargument that the appellant is not entitled to a reduction in the copayment amount simply because\nhe is receiving only 15 pills. The statutory and regulatory language reinforce the general intent that\nthe copayment is linked to the veteran's prescription (\"supply\") and not the number of pills provided.\nThe Court finds that the statutory language is clear and unambiguous on this point, and that the\nSecretary's interpretation of the statute is consistent with this language.\n                              2. Interpreting \"cost to the Secretary\"\n       The more critical question before the Court is whether the Secretary's regulation that\nincreased the copayment to $7 for each 30-day supply of medication is reasonable and whether the\nregulation is consistent with the requirement in section 1722A(a)(2) that provides \"[t]he Secretary\nmay not require a veteran to pay an amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for medication\ndescribed in paragraph (1).\" Paragraph (1) sets the copayment as $2 \"for each 30-day supply of\nmedication furnished\" to the veteran. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(1). Section 1722A(b)(1) specifically\nprovides that the Secretary shall prescribe regulations that may increase the copayment amount in\neffect under subsection (a). The appellant argues that the regulation, however, conflicts with the\nprovision in the statute that requires that the copayment amount not exceed the cost to the Secretary\nfor medication described \u00a71722A(a). The Secretary asserts that the \"cost to the Secretary for\nmedication\" includes VA's costs \"for dispensing a prescription.\" Secretary's Br. at 11. The Board\nhad determined that, based on a Veterans Health Administration (VHA) study cited in the regulatory\nhistory, it was clear \"that VA's cost of filling the veteran's 30-day prescription exceeds the $7\nco[]payment established under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110.\" Suppl. R. at 9A.\n       Again, as above, the Court looks to the statutory language to determine whether the\nSecretary's regulation is reasonable and consistent with the statute. Chevron and Sears, both supra.\nThe Court must, therefore, determine whether the statutory language allows the Secretary to include\nhis administrative costs in calculating the \"cost to the Secretary\" for the medication provided to the\nveteran.\n       The Court holds that the statutory language does not clearly speak to this precise question.\nThe \"cost to the Secretary for medication\" can be construed as being limited to the cost VA paid for\nthe actual medication only or can be interpreted as including the Secretary's costs in dispensing the\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fmedication, i.e., his administrative costs. Because \"the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect\nto the specific issue,\" the Court must determine whether the Secretary's interpretation is reasonable.\nChevron, 467 U.S. at 843. An \"'agency that has been granted authority to promulgate regulations\nnecessary to the administration of a program it oversees may fill in gaps in the statutory scheme left\nby Congress.'\" Sears, 349 F.3d at 1329 (quoting Contreras v. United States, 215 F.3d 1267, 1274\n(Fed. Cir. 2000)). An agency's gap-filling regulation must be upheld if it is reasonable and consistent\nwith the statutory framework. Id. We hold that the Secretary's interpretation of the statute\u2013as\nexpressed in the regulation at issue here, 38 C.F.R.\u00a7 17.110 (2002-2009)\u2013is reasonable and\nconsistent with the statute. Our holding is supported by both the regulatory and statutory history,\nas well as the statutory framework.\n          In the 2001 proposed rulemaking, the Secretary explained the increase in the copayment\namount from $2 to $7 through December 31, 2002, as well as the establishment of escalator\nprovisions to automatically increase the copayment amount. 66 Fed. Reg. at 36961. The Secretary\nstated:\n          Based on a review of industry standards, we believe that the medication copayment\n          should be increased from $2 to $7. We believe that the proposed $7 medication\n          copayment would be lower than or equal to most medication copayments charged by\n          the private health care industry. Further we believe it is a reasonable amount for the\n          majority of medications dispensed.\n\n          Also, under 38 U.S.C. 1722A, VA may not require a veteran to pay an amount in\n          excess of the actual cost of the medication and the pharmacy administrative costs\n          related to the dispensing of the medication. VHA conducted a study of the pharmacy\n          administrative costs relating to the dispensing of medication on an outpatient basis\n          and found that VA incurred a cost of $7.28 to dispense an outpatient medication even\n          without consideration of the actual cost of the medication. This amount covers the\n          cost of consultation time, filling time, dispensing time, an appropriate share of the\n          direct and indirect personnel costs, physical overhead and materials, and supply\n          costs. Under these circumstances, we believe that a $7 copayment would not exceed\n          VA's costs.\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n          In proposing the escalator provisions for the copayment amount, the Secretary explained that\nthis is \"to ensure that the copayment amounts increase with inflation.\" Id. The Secretary stated:\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\f        Also, increasing the copayment amount in whole dollar increments would be easily\n        understood by veterans and lessen the administrative burden on VA. Further, based\n        on commensurate increased costs to VA, we believe that VA's costs would remain\n        higher than the increases made by the escalator provisions.\n\nId. In adopting the proposed rule as the final rule without any changes, the Secretary noted that the\n1999 amendment to the statute to specifically authorize VA to increase the copayment amount\nshowed that \"the statutory intent was for VA to increase the copayment amount.\" 66 Fed. Reg. at\n63449. In its final rule, the Secretary noted certain legislative history for the 1999 amendment to\nsection 1722A that added subsection (b):\n        In helping VA to determine the amount of the copayment, the House Conference\n        Report (H. Rept. 106-237, July 16, 1999) specifically noted that the copayment for\n        DOD's Tricare Prime Plan included a $9 copayment for each 30-day prescription.\n        Further, the House Conference Report indicated at page 42, that \"[a] survey of\n        copayment trends in 1996-7 found the most common [prescription drug] copayment\n        among members of the American Association of Health Plans . . . [to be] in the range\n        of $5 to $10 per prescription.\"\n\nId. Notably, the Secretary declined to make any change to its proposed rule based on a commenter\nwho suggested that the copayment amount should vary based on geographic location. The Secretary\nnoted: \"We do not believe that this would be administratively feasible.\" Id. at 63450.\n        The same House Conference Report cited by the Secretary in his commentary to the final\nrule, noted above, also contains additional support for the Secretary's interpretation of the statute as\nallowing VA to include administrative costs in calculating the copayment amount. For instance, the\nHouse Report stated the following when discussing the need of VA to enhance revenues: \"In the\nCommittee's view, authorizing the Secretary to set reasonable copayment increases on prescription\ndrugs is a reasonable policy in the face of VA's mounting pharmaceutical costs\u2013approaching $2\nbillion annually. Notwithstanding an aggressive pharmacy benefits management policy, VA's\npharmacy costs have nearly doubled since copayments were instituted some nine years ago.\" H.R.\nRep. No. 106-237, Title II, \u00a7 201, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. (July 16, 1999) (to accompany H.R. 2116).\n        In addition to being supported by the legislative history, the Secretary's regulation is\nconsistent with the statutory framework. See Meeks v. West, 12 Vet.App. 352, 354 (1999) (\"'[E]ach\npart or section [of a statute] should be construed in connection with every other part or section so\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fas to produce a harmonious whole.'\") (second alteration in original) (quoting 2A NORMAN J. SINGER,\nSUTHERLAND ON STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION \u00a7 46.05 (5th ed. 1992)). A practical result of the\nregulation was to clearly define the words \"cost to the Secretary for medication\" in\nsection 1722A(a)(2) as comprising both the cost of the medication plus the administrative costs\nassociated with dispensing the medication. In section 1722A(a)(2), Congress specifically pointed\nback to section 1722A(a)(1) for a description of the term \"medication.\" Section 1722A(a)(1)\ndescribes the medication as a \"30-day supply of medication furnished\" the veteran. 38 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1722A(a)(1) (emphasis added). So, \"[t]he Secretary may not require a veteran to pay an amount\nin excess of the cost to the Secretary for [each 30-day supply of medication furnished]\" to the\nveteran. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a). The term \"supply\" is defined as \"an amount or quantity available\nfor use.\" WEBSTER'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY 1345 (3d ed. 1988). The term \"furnish\" means \"to\nsupply, provide, or equip with whatever is necessary or useful\" and \"implies the provision of all the\nthings requisite for a particular service, action, etc. [to furnish a house].\" Id. at 547. Thus, it appears\nthat the statutory terms describing the medication contemplate more than the cost of the pills\nthemselves. The costs of furnishing the 30-day supply of the medication implies that the cost of the\nmedication also includes the costs incurred for providing or getting the pills into the hands of the\nveterans\u2014the administrative costs associated with dispensing of the medication.\n        Moreover, Congress has indirectly indicated that it sanctions the Secretary's method of\nincreasing the copayment for medications furnished to veterans on an outpatient basis for the\ntreatment of a non-service-connected disability or condition. In 2002, the Secretary determined that\nVA was factoring in the administrative costs in its calculation of the copayment amount. In the nine\nyears since the promulgation of the Secretary's regulation, Congress has had ample opportunity to\nchange the way the Secretary has proceeded in this matter, but Congress has declined to do so.\nInstead, in 2003, Congress enacted revisions to the same statute that gives the Secretary authority\nto increase the copayment amount, but did nothing to reject or alter the Secretary's construction of\nthe statute or circumscribe the Secretary's regulation establishing the manner in which he increases\nthe copayment for medications. Specifically, the Court notes that the language in paragraphs 1 and\n2 of section 1722A(a), as relevant here, has remained the same since its enactment as section 622A\n\n\n\n\n                                                    11\n\fin November 1990.4 Significantly, after the Secretary issued his regulation in February 2002\n(\u00a717.110), which for the first time increased the statutory $2 copayment amount for each 30-day or\nless supply of medication, which increase was based in part on administrative costs related to the\ndispensing of the medication, Congress twice amended section 1722A: In February 2003, Congress\namended subsections (c) and (d) of section 1722A.5 And in December 2003, Congress amended\nsubsection (a)(3) of section 1722A regarding those veterans who are not required to pay a copayment\nfor medications.6\n         Despite Congress's consideration of this statute and its provisions twice in 2003, Congress\ndid not change subsection (b) regarding the authority Congress previously gave the Secretary to\nincrease the copayment amount for medications under subsection (a). Congress twice had the\nopportunity to object to the Secretary's regulation that increased the copayment for medications,\nincluding the considerations used by the Secretary for the increase, and did not do so. Accordingly,\n\n\n\n         4\n                  \u00a7 622A. Copayment for medications\n\n                     (a)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall require a veteran (other than\n                  a veteran with a service-connected disability rated 50 percent or more) to pay the\n                  United States $2 for each 30-day supply of medication furnished such veteran\n                  under this chapter on an outpatient basis for the treatment of a non-service-\n                  connected disability or condition. If the amount supplied is less than a 30-day\n                  supply, the amount of the charge may not be reduced.\n\n                     (2) The Secretary may not require a veteran to pay an amount in excess of the\n                  cost to the Secretary for medication described in paragraph (1).\n\n                      ....\n\n         Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub.

See California Industrial Products, Inc. v. United States, 436 F.3d\n1341, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (\"These regulations are appropriately considered in the construction of\n[this particular statute] because Congress is presumed to be aware of pertinent existing law.\");\nMudge v. United States, 308 F.3d 1220, 1232 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (\"In interpreting [this particular\nstatute] as amended, we presume that Congress was aware of any administrative or judicial\ninterpretations of the statute.\").\n        The Court recognizes that there may be cases in which \u00a7 17.110, as applied to the particular\nfacts of a case, does not produce the most cost-favorable result, such that, for example, two veterans,\nwho pay the same copayment amount for the same type of medication, may receive varying amounts\nof the medication. \"But a regulation is only required to operate reasonably, not perfectly.\" Sears,\n349 F.3d at 1331. The Secretary took into account the administrative costs for dispensing the\nmedication, as well as what plan would be administratively feasible. We hold that the Secretary has\nissued a gap-filling regulation that is not unreasonable or otherwise impermissible based on the\ncontentions of the appellant and, therefore, uphold the regulation as applied to the appellant. We\nwill, therefore, affirm the Board's December 24, 2008, decision. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet.App.\n426, 430 (1994) (holding that where law and not evidence is dispositive, claim should be denied or\nappeal terminated because of lack of legal merit or lack of entitlement under the law); see also\nValiao v. Principi, 17 Vet.App. 229, 232 (2003) (holding that \"[w]here the facts averred by a\nclaimant cannot conceivably result in any disposition of the appeal other than affirmance of the\nBoard decision, the case should not be remanded for development that could not possibly change the\noutcome of the decision\").\n\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n        Upon consideration of the foregoing analysis, the record on appeal, and the parties' pleadings,\nthe December 24, 2008, Board decision is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\f       HAGEL, Judge, joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part: I concur with the majority's\nconclusion that the plain and unambiguous language of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(1) requires a veteran\nto pay a full copayment for a 30-day supply of medication, without regard to the dosage or number\nof pills prescribed to the veteran. I write separately, however, to express my disagreement with the\nmajority's conclusion that the phrase \"cost to the Secretary for medication,\" as used in section\n1722A(a)(2), is susceptible to more than one interpretation.\n       The majority concludes that the phrase \"cost to the Secretary for medication\" contained in\nsection 1722A(a)(2) is ambiguous in that it \"can be construed as limited to the cost VA paid for\nactual medication only or can be interpreted as including the Secretary's costs in dispensing the\nmedication, i.e., his administrative costs.\" Majority Opinion at ___. I would conclude that this\nlanguage is clear, unambiguous, and cannot be construed as including costs incurred by the Secretary\nin dispensing the medication.\n       \"The starting point in interpreting a statute is its language, for '[i]f the intent of Congress is\nclear, that is the end of the matter.'\" Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 409 (1993)\n(quoting Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984)). \"In\ndetermining the plain meaning of statutory language, 'legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary\nmeaning of the words used.'\" Jones v. Brown, 41 F.3d 634, 638 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (quoting Ardestani\nv. INS, 502 U.S. 129, 136 (1991)).\n       The statutory provision at issue here, section 1722A(a)(2), states: \"The Secretary may not\nrequire a veteran to pay an amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for medication described\nin paragraph (1).\" As the majority notes and I agree, section 1722A(a)(2) therefore refers back to\nsection 1722A(a)(1) to clarify which medication is at issue. See Talley v. Derwinski, 2 Vet.App. 282,\n286 (1992) ( holding that \"[e]ach part or section [of a statute] should be construed in connection with\nevery other part or section so as to produce a harmonious whole\" (citation omitted; internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). In relevant part, section 1722A(a)(1) provides that \"the Secretary shall require a\nveteran to pay the United States $2 for each 30-day supply of medication furnished such veteran\nunder this chapter on an outpatient basis for the treatment of a non-service-connected disability or\ncondition. . . .\" 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a)(1) (emphasis added). Accordingly, when these provisions are\nread together, section 1722A(a)(2) clearly prevents the Secretary from \"requir[ing] a veteran to pay\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fan amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for [each 30-day supply of medication furnished\nsuch veteran under this chapter on an outpatient basis for the treatment of a non-service-connected\ndisability or condition].\" 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1722A(a).\n       Nowhere in this statutory interplay is there a reference to administrative costs incurred by the\nSecretary in dispensing the veteran's 30-day supply of medication, costs that are wholly apart from\nthe cost to the Secretary for the medication itself. Congress could, of course, have included language\nin the statute prohibiting the Secretary from requiring a veteran to pay more than the cost to the\nSecretary for the medication plus the cost of the Secretary's overhead for dispensing that medication.\nTo this end, it is notable that in 2002, when Congress first authorized VA to increase the $2\ncopayment found in section 1722A(a)(1) by adding subsection (b), it did not, in any way, alter the\nlanguage of section 1722A(a)(2). See The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, Pub.\nL. 106-117, Title II, \u00a7 201(a)(2), 113 Stat. 1560 (Nov. 30, 1999). Certainly, if Congress wished to\nallow VA to pass on rising administrative and pharmacy costs to veterans by virtue of increased\ncopayments for medication furnished to them, it could have done so by removing subsection (a)(2)\nof section 1722A or adding language to that subsection that contemplated such costs. As it did not\ndo so, however, I believe the meaning of the statutory language, and therefore Congress's intent, is\nclear and does not contemplate such administrative costs. Accordingly I would determine that this\n\"is the end of the matter\" and that both the Court and VA \"must give effect to the unambiguously\nexpressed intent of Congress,\" which is to prohibit the Secretary from charging a veteran a\ncopayment for a 30-day supply of medication in excess of the cost to the Secretary for that\nmedication. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842.\n       To be clear, I find no conflict between the past and present versions of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110\nand section 1722A. By amending section 1722A to add subsection (b), Congress clearly empowered\nVA to promulgate regulations increasing the copayment charged to veterans, previously set by statute\nat $2. Further, because, in section 1722A(a)(1), Congress initially established a blanket copayment\nof $2 to be paid by all such veterans, regardless of the type or amount of medication furnished, it\ncannot be said that VA acted unreasonably by maintaining a blanket copayment when it promulgated\n\u00a7 17.110 in 2002. Nevertheless, pursuant to the plain language of section 1722A(a)(2), any\ncopayment for which a veteran would ordinarily be responsible pursuant to section 1722(a)(1) and\n\n\n                                                 15\n\f\u00a7 17.110 must be reduced when that amount would be in excess of the cost to the Secretary for the\n30-day supply of medication furnished to the veteran, regardless of the type of medication or dose\nprescribed.\n       In the present case, because the appellant is required to split his Atenolol tablets to obtain the\ndesired dose, his 30-day supply of medication is 15 tablets. He argues that, by requiring him to pay\nthe full copayment amount established by \u00a7 17.110 ($7 from February 4, 2002, to December 31,\n2005, and $8 thereafter), VA is violating section 1722A(a)(2) by charging him more than the cost\nof this medication to the Secretary. Inherent in this argument is the appellant's contention that the\nSecretary pays less for 15 Atenolol tablets than VA has required him to pay (previously $7, now $8)\nas a coypayment.\n       The appellant also made this argument on appeal to the Board. See Supplemental R. at 8\n(\"The Board additionally notes that the veteran has repeatedly asserted that the cost of $7 for his\nco[]payment is excessive and in violation of 38 U.S.C.[] \u00a7 1722A.\"). In dismissing this argument,\nthe Board relied on the Veterans Health Administration study of VA's pharmacy administrative costs\nthat was referenced by the Secretary in the 2001 proposed rulemaking that ultimately led to the\npromulgation of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 17.110 (2002). As noted in the majority opinion, that study found that\n\"VA incurred a cost of $7.28 to dispense an outpatient medication even without consideration of the\nactual cost of the medication.\" 66 Fed. Reg. 36,960, 36,961 (2001) (emphasis added). The Board\nreasoned that, because the study indicated that VA incurs a $7.28 administrative cost every time it\ndispenses medication on an outpatient basis, \"it [is] clear that VA's cost of filling the [appellant's]\n30-day prescription exceeds the $7 co[]payment established under \u00a7 17.110.\" Supplemental R. at\n9. Implicit in this reasoning is that the Board interpreted section 1722A(a)(2) as including the\nSecretary's administrative costs associated with dispensing the medication as part of the cost of the\nmedication to the Secretary.\n       When a pure question of law, such as the interpretation of a statute, is at issue, the Court\nreviews the conclusions of the Board de novo, without deference. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet.App. 227,\n230 (2000). As explained above, after reviewing the language of section 1722A, I would conclude\nthat the plain and unambiguous language of subsection (a)(2) prohibits the Secretary from requiring\na veteran to pay an amount in excess of the cost to the Secretary for each 30-day supply of\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fmedication furnished to him or her, without regard to the administrative costs incurred by the\nSecretary in actually dispensing such medication. I would therefore conclude that the Board's\ninterpretation of that provision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in\naccordance with the law. See Kent v. Principi, 389 F.3d 1380, 1384 (2004) (holding that the\n\"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law\" standard\nof review \"contemplates de novo review of questions of law\"). Accordingly, I would set aside the\nBoard's December 2008 decision to the extent that it concluded that the appellant's copayment was\nnot excessive under section 1722A(a)(2) and would remand the matter for further development and\nreadjudication consistent with a proper interpretation of section 1722A(a)(2).\n       Lastly, I understand that some might say that the interpretation that I express would place\nan unnecessary accounting burden on VA. The calculation that I believe the statute requires VA to\nmake in these instances is, however, routinely made up front by private pharmacies when\ndetermining the profit margin sought on each drug dispensed to their customers.
