Sec. 841(a)(1) (1988);  use of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 924(c)(1) (West Supp.1995);  possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 922(g)(1) (West Supp.1995);  and possession of a firearm with a removed serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 922(k) (West Supp.1995).  Robinson claims that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support the jury's verdict on the three firearm charges, because the Government failed to prove that Robinson knew there were guns in the gym bag he had in his possession.

Finally, possession need not be exclusive, but may be shared by others, and is susceptible of proof by circumstantial as well as direct evidence.  Laughman, 618 F.2d at 1077.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence shows that a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Robinson knowingly possessed the firearms.  First, when police officers entered the residence, they observed Robinson holding the gym bag in which the guns were found.  Second, Robinson admitted that he handled the guns in the past and that the guns were \"community property\" used for protection during drug deals.  Finally, Robinson was convicted of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, and an expert narcotics agent testified that firearms were common drug distribution tools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on this evidence, the jury could easily conclude that Robinson knew the guns were in the gym bag.  We find that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, this evidence is thus sufficient to support the jury's verdict.  Accordingly, we affirm Robinson's convictions.  We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED</p>\n    ", "Case_Text": "", "Reporter_Citation": "60 F.3d 826", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "eefda250b82d65d8df3b93fddfc41ad5107d6d50", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/103597/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/376844/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/402204/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/403677/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/556667/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/576246/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/578218/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/628045/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/668535/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2012-04-17T05:42:59Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": null, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/700105/united-states-v-kenyatta-robinson-aka-kavon-hender/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "700105", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "60 F.3d 826 (July 14,1995)", "CL_opinion_local_path": null, "LDA_Model_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_cluster": {"state_cite_two": "", "date_blocked": null, "syllabus": "", "posture": "", "federal_cite_one": "60 F.3d 826", "case_name_short": "", "date_filed": "1995-07-14", "federal_cite_two": "", "docket": {"court": {"has_opinion_scraper": true, "in_use": true, "url": "http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/", "start_date": "1891-03-03", "full_name": "Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit", "date_modified": "2014-10-31T01:58:02.297000Z", "position": 104.0, "jurisdiction": "F", "has_oral_argument_scraper": true, "resource_uri": "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/courts/ca4/", "citation_string": "4th Cir.", "short_name": "Fourth Circuit", "end_date": null}, "date_blocked": null, "filepath_ia": null, "docket_number": "94-5515", "date_argued": null, "date_reargued": null, "cause": null, "case_name_short": "", "date_filed": null, "filepath_local": null, "date_cert_denied": null, "source": 0, "assigned_to": null, "clusters": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/clusters/700105/"], "jurisdiction_type": null, "audio_files": [], "date_reargument_denied": null, "date_terminated": null, "case_name_full": "", "date_created": "2014-10-30T13:59:25.799443Z", "slug": "united-states-v-kenyatta-robinson-aka-kavon-hender", "nature_of_suit": null, "date_modified": "2014-10-30T13:59:25.799443Z", "date_cert_granted": null, "jury_demand": null, "blocked": false, "case_name": "United States v.
