The court\n\n8   concludes that, under Daimler A.G. v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014), the record does not\n\n9   support a finding that Ford is \u201cessentially at home\u201d in Colorado. Therefore, Ford is not\n\n0   subject to general personal jurisdiction in Colorado. Because the trial court did not\n\n1   determine whether Ford was subject to specific jurisdiction, the supreme court does not\n\n2   reach that issue. The court also holds that maintaining a registered agent in the state\n\n3   does not convert a foreign corporation to a resident.

Ct. 746 (2014). We conclude that the record does not support a finding\n\nthat Ford is \u201cessentially at home\u201d in Colorado, and therefore, Ford is not subject to\n\ngeneral personal jurisdiction here. Because the trial court did not determine whether\n\nFord was subject to specific jurisdiction, we do not reach that issue.\n\n\u00b62     We also review the trial court\u2019s conclusion that venue was proper in Denver\n\nCounty because Ford has a registered agent there.           We hold that maintaining a\n\nregistered agent in the state does not convert a foreign corporation to a resident.\n\nTherefore, because none of the parties reside in Denver and the accident did not occur\n\nthere, we conclude that venue is not appropriate in Denver County.\n\n\u00b63     Accordingly, we make our rule to show cause absolute, and we remand with\n\ninstructions for the trial court to transfer the case to an appropriate venue. A trial court\n\nin a proper venue must then determine whether Ford is subject to specific jurisdiction.\n\n                           I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n\u00b64     This case arises from a car accident that occurred on September 25, 2013, in\n\nDouglas County, Colorado.       Plaintiff John Scott Magill was driving his 2007 Ford\n\nFusion when it collided with a vehicle driven by defendant Mark Polunci. Magill\n\nsuffered severe injuries in the collision, including a traumatic brain injury and spinal\n\ninjuries. Magill and his wife, Suzanna Magill, filed a lawsuit in Denver District Court\n\nagainst Polunci, Ford, and other defendants to recover for his injuries. The Magills\n\n                                             3\n\fclaim that their Fusion had defective seat and restraint systems that caused Mr. Magill\u2019s\n\nserious and permanent injuries. They contend that Ford, as the manufacturer of the\n\nFusion, is liable for their injuries based on three causes of action: (1) strict liability,\n\n(2) negligence or negligence per se, and (3) loss of consortium. Ford filed a C.R.C.P.\n\n12(b)(2) Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction or, in the Alternative, to\n\nTransfer Venue Pursuant to C.R.C.P. 98(e). Polunci also filed a motion to change venue.\n\n\u00b65    The following undisputed facts are relevant to the jurisdiction and venue\n\nquestions presented: The accident underlying this case occurred in Douglas County,\n\nColorado. The Magills reside in Douglas County. Mr. Polunci resides in El Paso\n\nCounty.    Ford is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in\n\nMichigan. Ford has a registered agent in Denver County. Ford markets and sells cars\n\nthroughout the country, including Colorado, through franchised dealerships.           Ford\n\ndoes not manufacture cars in Colorado, but it maintains several offices and businesses\n\nin the state, including the Ford Motor Company Service School and an office for Ford\n\nMotor Credit Co., LLC.\n\n\u00b66    The trial court denied both motions to change venue. It observed that \u201cFord is a\n\nforeign corporation whose registered agent is located in Denver County and . . . [was]\n\nserved there.\u201d Consequently, it concluded that \u201cvenue is proper in Denver County\n\nunder the provision of Rule 98(c)(1) that allows an action to be brought in the county in\n\nwhich at least one defendant resides.\u201d\n\n\u00b67    Ford also moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.           The\n\ncompany argued that it is not subject to general personal jurisdiction because it is not\n\n                                            4\n\f\u201cat home\u201d in Colorado.        Ford argued that it was not subject to specific personal\n\njurisdiction because the car accident did not arise out of its contacts with Colorado. The\n\ntrial court concluded that the Magills \u201cmade a prima facie showing that Ford is at\n\n\u2018home\u2019 in Colorado\u201d and that Ford\u2019s \u201ccontinuous and systematic affiliations\u201d with\n\nColorado were sufficient to subject Ford to general personal jurisdiction in Colorado.\n\n\u00b68     Ford\u2019s petition presents the following issues: (1) whether the trial court erred\n\nwhen it concluded that it had general personal jurisdiction over Ford and (2) whether\n\nthe trial court erred by concluding that venue was proper in Denver.\n\n                                 II. Original Jurisdiction\n\n\u00b69     \u201cOriginal relief pursuant to C.A.R. 21 is an extraordinary remedy that is limited\n\nboth in purpose and availability.\u201d Dwyer v. State, 2015 CO 58, \u00b6 4, 357 P.3d 185, 187\n\n(quoting People v Kailey, 2014 CO 50, \u00b6 9, 333 P.3d 89, 92). We generally elect to hear\n\ncases under C.A.R. 21 \u201cthat raise issues of first impression and that are of significant\n\npublic importance.\u201d Id., 357 P.3d at 187\u201388. We often elect to hear challenges to \u201cthe\n\nexercise of personal jurisdiction by district courts over out-of-state defendants\u201d because\n\nthey \u201craise[] the question whether it is unfair to force such a party to defend here at all.\u201d\n\nKeefe v. Kirschenbaum & Kirschenbaum, P.C., 40 P.3d 1267, 1270 (Colo. 2002). This\n\ncase satisfies these criteria. Since the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Daimler, we\n\nhave not yet considered the scope of general personal jurisdiction for nonresident\n\ncorporate defendants who do business in Colorado. This issue not only concerns the\n\nrights of the parties in this case but also affects the rights of future litigants.\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f\u00b610    We also hear cases under C.A.R. 21 that raise \u201cissues involving venue\u201d because\n\nsuch issues \u201cdirectly affect the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction and authority to proceed with a\n\ncase\u201d and \u201creview of a venue determination serves to avoid the delay and expense\n\ninvolved in re-trial should this court deem venue improper.\u201d Hagan v. Farmers Ins.\n\nExch., 2015 CO 6, \u00b613, 342 P.3d 427, 432. Thus, original review of both the personal\n\njurisdiction question and the venue question is appropriate in this case.\n\n                               III. Standard of Review\n\n\u00b611    Interpreting the scope of general personal jurisdiction under Daimler presents a\n\nquestion of law, which we review de novo. See In re Marriage of Malwitz, 99 P.3d 56,\n\n59 (Colo. 2004). We also review de novo whether the Magills established the prima\n\nfacie case of personal jurisdiction necessary to defeat Ford\u2019s 12(b)(2) motion. Archangel\n\nDiamond Corp. v. Lukoil, 123 P.3d 1187, 1192 (Colo. 2005), as modified on denial of\n\nreh\u2019g (Dec. 19, 2005) (noting that, when a trial court denies a 12(b)(2) motion based on\n\ndocumentary evidence alone, \u201cthe plaintiff need only demonstrate a prima facie\n\nshowing of personal jurisdiction to defeat the motion\u201d).\n\n\u00b612    We review a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to change venue for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Hagan, \u00b6\u00b6 15\u201316, 342 P.3d at 432 (citing Sampson v. Dist. Ct., 590 P.2d 958,\n\n959 (Colo. 1979)). A trial court abuses its discretion when it proceeds to hear a case\n\nwhere venue is improper. Id.; see also Denver Air Ctr. v. Dist. Ct., 839 P.2d 1182, 1185\n\n(Colo. 1992) (\u201c[W]hen a party requests a change of venue upon a ground which entitles\n\nit to the change as a matter of right the trial court loses all jurisdiction except to order\n\nthe change.\u201d).\n\n                                             6\n\f                                      IV. Analysis\n\n\u00b613    We begin by reviewing the law of personal jurisdiction and then conclude that,\n\nunder Daimler, the trial court lacks general personal jurisdiction over Ford. We note,\n\nhowever, that Ford may be subject to specific personal jurisdiction in Colorado. But\n\nbecause the trial court did not make any findings regarding specific jurisdiction, we\n\ndecline to reach that issue. Next, we address the trial court\u2019s holding that venue is\n\nappropriate in Denver County. We conclude that maintaining a registered agent does\n\nnot convert a foreign company to a resident company. Therefore, under our rule in\n\nDenver Air Center, venue is not appropriate in Denver. 839 P.2d at 1185.\n\n                               A. Personal Jurisdiction\n\n\u00b614    To exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, a Colorado court must\n\ncomply with Colorado\u2019s long-arm statute and constitutional due process. Archangel\n\nDiamond Corp., 123 P.3d at 1193. Colorado\u2019s long-arm statute confers \u201cthe maximum\n\njurisdiction permitted by the due process clause of the United States and Colorado\n\nconstitutions.\u201d Id. (citing Keefe, 40 P.3d at 1270); see also U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Colo.\n\nConst. art. 2, \u00a7 25; \u00a7 13-1-124, C.R.S. (2016). Therefore, we engage in a constitutional due\n\nprocess analysis to determine whether a Colorado court has jurisdiction over an out-of-\n\nstate defendant.\n\n\u00b615    The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause governs the outer boundaries\n\nof a state\u2019s authority to proceed against nonresident defendants. Shaffer v. Heitner,\n\n433 U.S. 186, 207 (1977). In International Shoe Co. v. Washington, the U.S. Supreme\n\nCourt held that a state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant\n\n                                             7\n\fif the defendant has \u201ccertain minimum contacts with [the state] such that the\n\nmaintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial\n\njustice.\u2019\u201d 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).\n\nThis relationship-based approach to personal jurisdiction gave rise to two distinct\n\ncategories of jurisdiction: general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction.      Daimler,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 754; Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 923\u201324\n\n(2011). We now address these categories in greater detail.\n\n                               1. General Jurisdiction\n\n\u00b616   General jurisdiction, or all-purpose jurisdiction, permits a court to exercise\n\njurisdiction over a defendant for any and all causes of action arising from any of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s activities, even if those activities occurred outside the forum state. Daimler,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 754 (citing Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 318, and Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919).\n\nHowever, \u201conly a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant\n\namenable to all-purpose jurisdiction there.\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 760. For a corporate\n\ndefendant, the paradigmatic fora for general jurisdiction are the corporation\u2019s place of\n\nincorporation and principal place of business. Id. at 760\u201361 (citing Goodyear, 564 U.S.\n\nat 924). These places have the benefit of being unique and easily ascertainable, and a\n\ncorporation may reasonably anticipate being haled into court in either place. Id. Thus,\n\ngeneral jurisdiction guarantees plaintiffs at least one forum to file any suit against a\n\ncorporation. Id.\n\n\u00b617   A state may also exercise general jurisdiction over a nonresident corporate\n\ndefendant whose affiliations with the forum state are \u201cso \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as\n\n                                            8\n\fto render them essentially at home in the forum State.\u201d Id. at 754 (quoting Goodyear,\n\n564 U.S. at 919). A nonresident defendant\u2019s contacts with the state will rarely justify\n\nexercising general jurisdiction. See id. at 757-58. \u201cPerkins v. Benguet [Consolidated]\n\nMining Co.[, 342 U.S. 437 (1952),] remains the textbook case of general jurisdiction\n\nappropriately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not consented to suit in the\n\nforum.\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 755-56 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 927\u201328). In Perkins,\n\nthe defendant company was incorporated in the Philippines and operated gold and\n\nsilver mines there. 342 U.S. at 448. During World War II, the company\u2019s president\n\nmoved to Ohio, where he maintained an office with the company\u2019s files and oversaw\n\nthe company\u2019s activities. Id. at 447-48. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the company\n\nhad temporarily moved its principal place of business to Ohio, and therefore, the court\n\nin Ohio did not offend due process by exercising general jurisdiction over the company.\n\nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. at 756 (citing Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 780 n.11\n\n(1984)).\n\n\u00b618    Recently, in Daimler, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified the law of general\n\npersonal jurisdiction as applied to nonresident, corporate defendants. 134 S. Ct. at 746.\n\nThe Court considered whether California had jurisdiction over a claim \u201cbrought by\n\nforeign plaintiffs against a foreign defendant based on events occurring entirely out of\n\nthe United States.\u201d Id. at 750. The plaintiffs argued that the California court had\n\njurisdiction over the corporate defendant, Daimler, based on one of its subsidiary\u2019s\n\ncontacts with the state. Id. at 751. The Court assumed that the subsidiary, MBUSA, was\n\n\u201cat home\u201d in California. Id. at 760. It also assumed that MBUSA\u2019s contacts with\n\n                                            9\n\fCalifornia\u2014including a regional office and other facilities in California, along with\n\nsignificant sales in the state\u2014could be imputed to Daimler. Id. Nevertheless, the Court\n\nconcluded that, even though MBUSA was \u201cat home\u201d in California and all of MBUSA\u2019s\n\ncontacts could be imputed to Daimler, there was \u201cno basis to subject Daimler to general\n\njurisdiction in California, for Daimler\u2019s slim contacts with the State hardly render it at\n\nhome there.\u201d Id. The Court recognized that even if a company conducts significant\n\nbusiness in a state, if that business represents a relatively small portion of the\n\ncompany\u2019s national or international reach, then the company cannot be considered at\n\nhome in the state. Id. at 760\u201361, 761 n.19, 762 n.20. Therefore, because Daimler\u2019s\n\ncontacts with California\u2014while independently substantial\u2014were only a small portion\n\nof its overall business, Daimler could not be considered \u201cat home\u201d in California.1 Id. at\n\n762.\n\n\u00b619    In the case before us, the trial court concluded that Daimler did not control and\n\nthat exercising general jurisdiction over Ford was appropriate. First, it distinguished\n\nthis case by noting that Daimler involved international disputes with foreign plaintiffs.\n\nBut Daimler cannot be disposed of so easily.         Whether a nonresident corporate\n\ndefendant is a resident of another country or another state is irrelevant to the general\n\njurisdiction inquiry. Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919 (recognizing that the test for exercising\n\n1 The Tenth Circuit recently noted that Daimler did not create a new rule for general\npersonal jurisdiction but merely \u201creaffirmed the Goodyear standard.\u201d Am. Fidelity\nAssur. Co. v. Bank of New York Mellon, 810 F.3d 1234, 1241 (10th Cir. 2016) (petition for\ncertiorari filed). Whether Daimler amounted to a sea change in personal jurisdiction\njurisprudence or merely reaffirmed existing law is beyond the scope of this case. We\nneed only determine whether Ford\u2019s contacts supported the conclusion that Ford is at\nhome in Colorado. See Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761; Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919.\n\n                                           10\n\fgeneral jurisdiction is the same for all \u201cforeign (sister-state or foreign-country)\n\ncorporations\u201d).\n\n\u00b620    Next, the trial court concluded that, \u201cunlike in Daimler, Ford has more than \u2018slim\n\ncontacts\u2019 with Colorado.\u201d The trial court relied on Ford\u2019s \u201caggressive\u201d marketing and\n\nsales through over thirty dealerships in Colorado. It also noted that Ford maintains\n\noffices and businesses in Colorado, has a registered agent in Colorado, and trains and\n\ncertifies mechanics to work with Colorado consumers. The trial court added that \u201cFord\n\nhas actively litigated, as both a plaintiff and defendant[,] in cases in Colorado.\u201d These\n\ncontacts, however, pale in comparison to the significant contacts that were deemed\n\n\u201cslim\u201d in Daimler.\n\n\u00b621    In Daimler, the Court imputed MBUSA\u2019s substantial contacts to Daimler and\n\nnevertheless determined that those contacts were \u201cslim\u201d and therefore insufficient to\n\nsupport general jurisdiction.   134 S. Ct. at 760.   These \u201cslim\u201d contacts included a\n\nregional office and other facilities in the state. Id. at 752. MBUSA was also the largest\n\nsupplier of luxury vehicles in California\u2014\u201cover 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the\n\nUnited States\u201d took place in California and \u201c2.4% of Daimler\u2019s worldwide sales\u201d were\n\nattributable to California. Id. A comparison between Ford\u2019s contacts with Colorado\n\nand those in Daimler\u2014which were deemed insufficient to support general\n\njurisdiction\u2014reveals that Ford\u2019s contacts with Colorado do not subject it to general\n\njurisdiction here.\n\n\u00b622    Under Goodyear and Daimler, the key inquiry is whether Ford is \u201cat home\u201d in\n\nColorado. Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 (citing Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919). Determining\n\n                                           11\n\fthat a corporation is \u201cat home\u201d simply because it does business in Colorado would be\n\n\u201cunacceptably grasping.\u201d     Id. at 760\u201361.    \u201cGeneral jurisdiction instead calls for an\n\nappraisal of a corporation\u2019s activities in their entirety, nationwide and worldwide. A\n\ncorporation that operates in many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of\n\nthem.\u201d Id. at 762 n.20; accord Presby Patent Tr. v. Infiltrator Sys., Inc., Civil No. 14-cv-\n\n542-JL, 2015 WL 3506517, at *4\u20135 (D.N.H. June 3, 2015) (\u201cUnder Daimler, then, it is no\n\nlonger enough for the defendant to have \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 contacts with the\n\nforum state . . . . Daimler requires at the very least that a defendant have systematic and\n\ncontinuous contacts with the forum that sets the forum apart from other states where\n\n[the] defendant may conduct business\u2014contacts that render the forum in some manner\n\nequivalent to a principal place of business.\u201d (citations omitted)).\n\n\u00b623    Under Daimler, the record in this case does not support a finding that general\n\njurisdiction over Ford is appropriate. As was true of the defendant in Daimler, Ford\n\nconducts business throughout the country, but the Magills failed to present any\n\nevidence that Ford\u2019s contacts with Colorado are somehow different or more substantial\n\nthan its contacts with other states where it sells cars. Nothing about Ford\u2019s contacts\n\nwith Colorado suggest that it is \u201cat home\u201d here. Moreover, no special circumstances\u2014\n\nsuch as temporarily relocating the company\u2019s principal place of business during\n\nwartime\u2014indicate that this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d that would render Ford at home in\n\nColorado. Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 n.19 (citing Perkins, 342 U.S. 437, as an example of\n\nan \u201cexceptional case\u201d where \u201ca corporation\u2019s operations in a forum other than its\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fformal place of incorporation or principal place of business may be so substantial as to\n\nrender the corporation at home in that State\u201d).\n\n\u00b624    Because Ford is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business\n\nin Michigan, the Magills have not demonstrated that Ford is \u201cessentially at home\u201d in\n\nColorado. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred by exercising general\n\njurisdiction over Ford. However, our conclusion that Ford is not subject to general\n\npersonal jurisdiction does not compel the conclusion that the Magills have no recourse\n\nin Colorado; Ford may be subject to specific personal jurisdiction.\n\n                                 2. Specific Jurisdiction\n\n\u00b625    \u201cSpecific jurisdiction has become the centerpiece of modern jurisdiction theory,\n\nwhile general jurisdiction [has played] a reduced role.\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 755 (citing\n\nGoodyear, 564 U.S. at 925). A corporation\u2019s \u201ccontinuous activity of some sorts within a\n\nstate is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits\n\nunrelated to that activity.\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 757 (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at\n\n318). But a state may still exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident corporate defendant if\n\nthe cause of action arises out of the defendant\u2019s in-state activities. Id. at 754 (citing Int\u2019l\n\nShoe, 326 U.S. at 317). Some activities\u2014such as having agency relationships within the\n\nforum state or placing products into the stream of commerce\u2014may support a finding of\n\nspecific, but not general, jurisdiction. See, e.g., Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 759 n.13 (\u201cAgency\n\nrelationships, we have recognized, may be relevant to the existence of specific\n\njurisdiction.\u201d (citing Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. 310)); Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 927 (\u201cFlow of a\n\nmanufacturer\u2019s products into the forum, we have explained, may bolster an affiliation\n\n                                              13\n\fgermane to specific jurisdiction.\u201d (citing World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson,\n\n444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980)).\n\n\u00b626    Here, after concluding that Ford was subject to general jurisdiction, the trial\n\ncourt found \u201cit unnecessary for it to review Ford\u2019s arguments as to whether the Magills\n\n[had] established specific jurisdiction.\u201d Because we reverse the trial court\u2019s holding\n\nregarding general jurisdiction, we now remand the case for the trial court to reevaluate\n\nFord\u2019s connections with Colorado and to this case to determine whether it has specific\n\njurisdiction over Ford.\n\n                                        B. Venue\n\n\u00b627    We now turn to Ford\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by concluding that\n\nvenue is proper in Denver County. The trial court concluded that, because Ford has a\n\nregistered agent in Denver, the company resides there. Therefore, it held that venue\n\nwas proper under C.R.C.P. 98(c)(1). We disagree.\n\n\u00b628    For a tort action, C.R.C.P. 98(c) dictates the proper location for venue:\n\n       [A]n action shall be tried in the county in which the defendants, or any of\n       them, may reside at the commencement of the action, or in the county\n       where the plaintiff resides when service is made on the defendant in such\n       county; or if the defendant is a nonresident of this state, the same may be\n       tried in any county in which the defendant may be found in this state, or\n       in the county designated in the complaint . . . .\n\nThe rule also states that a tort action may \u201cbe tried in the county where the tort was\n\ncommitted.\u201d C.R.C.P. 98(c)(5). \u201cA harmonious construction of the rule requires that,\n\nwhen at least one defendant is a Colorado resident, [a] plaintiff may not designate a\n\ncounty that is unrelated to either the defendant\u2019s county of residence, the plaintiff\u2019s\n\n\n                                             14\n\fcounty of residence, or the county in which a tort occurred.\u201d Denver Air Ctr., 839 P.2d\n\nat 1185.\n\n\u00b629    The trial court concluded that Ford resides in Denver because its registered agent\n\nis located there. To bolster the trial court\u2019s holding, the Magills cite a litany of cases\n\nfrom other states where the court concluded that a corporation \u201cresided\u201d where its\n\nregistered agent was located. However, the decisions in all of these cases rely on state\n\nstatutes or rules.2\n\n\n\n2 See WBC Holdings, Inc. v. Thornton, 443 S.E.2d 686, 687 (Ga.

Galles Chevrolet Co., 2007-\nNMSC-052, 168 P.3d 116, 118 (relying on a state statute that permitted venue \u201cwhere the\nstatutory agent designated by the foreign corporation resides\u201d); Shetty v.

Freight Lines, Inc. v. Hatley, 614 S.W.2d 864,\n866 (Tex. Civ. App. 1981) (\u201cA Texas corporation for venue purposes is a resident of the\ncounty where its designated registered office and agent is located.\u201d (citing Ward v.\nFairway Operating Co., 364 S.W.2d 194, 195 (Tex. 1963) (construing portions of the\nTexas Business Corporation Act as \u201clegislative authorization . . . that the place of its\ndesignated registered office and agent shall constitute a statutory place of residence\u201d))).\n\n                                             15\n\f\u00b630    Our own constitution, statutes, and rules impose no such requirement.\n\nColorado\u2019s constitution requires foreign corporations to have \u201cone or more known\n\nplaces of business, and an authorized agent or agents in the same, upon whom process\n\nmay be served.\u201d Colo. Const. art. XV, \u00a7 10. Nothing in this language suggests that\n\ncomplying with the constitutional requirement to maintain a registered agent converts a\n\nnonresident corporate defendant into a resident. See id. On the contrary, the language\n\nrecognizes that, even though a foreign corporation must maintain a registered agent to\n\nreceive service, the corporation is still considered \u201cforeign.\u201d Id. No other statutes or\n\nrules address the effect of a corporation\u2019s registered agent on the corporation\u2019s\n\nresidence. Therefore, Ford\u2019s maintenance of a registered agent in Denver does not\n\nconvert it into a Denver resident.\n\n\u00b631    A straightforward application of the Denver Air Center rule reveals that venue is\n\nnot proper in Denver County. See 839 P.2d at 1185. Under Denver Air Center, \u201cwhen\n\nat least one defendant is a Colorado resident, plaintiff may not designate a county that\n\nis unrelated to either the defendant\u2019s county of residence, the plaintiff\u2019s county of\n\nresidence, or the county in which a tort occurred.\u201d Id. at 1185. The Magills reside in\n\nDouglas County, Mr. Polunci resides in El Paso County, and, as we have established,\n\nFord is a nonresident defendant. The accident central to this case occurred in Douglas\n\nCounty. Therefore, venue in this case is only proper in either Douglas County or El\n\nPaso County.\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f                                    V. Conclusion\n\n\u00b632    Because the record does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Ford may be\n\nsubject to general personal jurisdiction in Colorado, we reverse the trial court\u2019s holding\n\non this issue. We also reverse the trial court\u2019s holding that venue is proper in Denver\n\nCounty. Accordingly, we make the rule to show cause absolute. Because a court \u201closes\n\nall jurisdiction except to order a change [in venue]\u201d when venue is improper, id., we\n\nremand with instructions for the trial court to transfer the case to an appropriate venue.\n\nA trial court in a proper venue must then determine whether Ford is subject to specific\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">1                 Opinions of the Colorado Supreme Court are available to the\n2             public and can be accessed through the Judicial Branch\u2019s homepage at\n3               http://www.courts.state.co.us.

Because the trial court did not\n\n1   determine whether Ford was subject to specific jurisdiction, the supreme court does not\n\n2   reach that issue.

We conclude that the record does not support a finding\n\nthat Ford is \u201cessentially at home\u201d in Colorado, and therefore, Ford is not subject to\n\ngeneral personal jurisdiction here. Because the trial court did not determine whether\n\nFord was subject to specific jurisdiction, we do not reach that issue.\n\n\u00b62     We also review the trial court\u2019s conclusion that venue was proper in Denver\n\nCounty because Ford has a registered agent there.           We hold that maintaining a\n\nregistered agent in the state does not convert a foreign corporation to a resident.\n\nTherefore, because none of the parties reside in Denver and the accident did not occur\n\nthere, we conclude that venue is not appropriate in Denver County.\n\n\u00b63     Accordingly, we make our rule to show cause absolute, and we remand with\n\ninstructions for the trial court to transfer the case to an appropriate venue. A trial court\n\nin a proper venue must then determine whether Ford is subject to specific jurisdiction.\n\n                           I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n\u00b64     This case arises from a car accident that occurred on September 25, 2013, in\n\nDouglas County, Colorado.       Plaintiff John Scott Magill was driving his 2007 Ford\n\nFusion when it collided with a vehicle driven by defendant Mark Polunci. Magill\n\nsuffered severe injuries in the collision, including a traumatic brain injury and spinal\n\ninjuries. Magill and his wife, Suzanna Magill, filed a lawsuit in Denver District Court\n\nagainst Polunci, Ford, and other defendants to recover for his injuries. The Magills\n\n                                             3\n\fclaim that their Fusion had defective seat and restraint systems that caused Mr. Magill\u2019s\n\nserious and permanent injuries. They contend that Ford, as the manufacturer of the\n\nFusion, is liable for their injuries based on three causes of action: (1) strict liability,\n\n(2) negligence or negligence per se, and (3) loss of consortium. Ford filed a C.R.C.P.\n\n12(b)(2) Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction or, in the Alternative, to\n\nTransfer Venue Pursuant to C.R.C.P. 98(e). Polunci also filed a motion to change venue.\n\n\u00b65    The following undisputed facts are relevant to the jurisdiction and venue\n\nquestions presented: The accident underlying this case occurred in Douglas County,\n\nColorado. The Magills reside in Douglas County. Mr. Polunci resides in El Paso\n\nCounty.    Ford is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in\n\nMichigan. Ford has a registered agent in Denver County. Ford markets and sells cars\n\nthroughout the country, including Colorado, through franchised dealerships.           Ford\n\ndoes not manufacture cars in Colorado, but it maintains several offices and businesses\n\nin the state, including the Ford Motor Company Service School and an office for Ford\n\nMotor Credit Co., LLC.\n\n\u00b66    The trial court denied both motions to change venue. It observed that \u201cFord is a\n\nforeign corporation whose registered agent is located in Denver County and . . . [was]\n\nserved there.\u201d Consequently, it concluded that \u201cvenue is proper in Denver County\n\nunder the provision of Rule 98(c)(1) that allows an action to be brought in the county in\n\nwhich at least one defendant resides.\u201d\n\n\u00b67    Ford also moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.           The\n\ncompany argued that it is not subject to general personal jurisdiction because it is not\n\n                                            4\n\f\u201cat home\u201d in Colorado.        Ford argued that it was not subject to specific personal\n\njurisdiction because the car accident did not arise out of its contacts with Colorado. The\n\ntrial court concluded that the Magills \u201cmade a prima facie showing that Ford is at\n\n\u2018home\u2019 in Colorado\u201d and that Ford\u2019s \u201ccontinuous and systematic affiliations\u201d with\n\nColorado were sufficient to subject Ford to general personal jurisdiction in Colorado.\n\n\u00b68     Ford\u2019s petition presents the following issues: (1) whether the trial court erred\n\nwhen it concluded that it had general personal jurisdiction over Ford and (2) whether\n\nthe trial court erred by concluding that venue was proper in Denver.\n\n                                 II.

Analysis\n\n\u00b613    We begin by reviewing the law of personal jurisdiction and then conclude that,\n\nunder Daimler, the trial court lacks general personal jurisdiction over Ford. We note,\n\nhowever, that Ford may be subject to specific personal jurisdiction in Colorado. But\n\nbecause the trial court did not make any findings regarding specific jurisdiction, we\n\ndecline to reach that issue. Next, we address the trial court\u2019s holding that venue is\n\nappropriate in Denver County. We conclude that maintaining a registered agent does\n\nnot convert a foreign company to a resident company. Therefore, under our rule in\n\nDenver Air Center, venue is not appropriate in Denver. 839 P.2d at 1185.\n\n                               A. Personal Jurisdiction\n\n\u00b614    To exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, a Colorado court must\n\ncomply with Colorado\u2019s long-arm statute and constitutional due process. Archangel\n\nDiamond Corp., 123 P.3d at 1193. Colorado\u2019s long-arm statute confers \u201cthe maximum\n\njurisdiction permitted by the due process clause of the United States and Colorado\n\nconstitutions.\u201d Id. (citing Keefe, 40 P.3d at 1270); see also U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Colo.\n\nConst. art. 2, \u00a7 25; \u00a7 13-1-124, C.R.S. (2016). Therefore, we engage in a constitutional due\n\nprocess analysis to determine whether a Colorado court has jurisdiction over an out-of-\n\nstate defendant.\n\n\u00b615    The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause governs the outer boundaries\n\nof a state\u2019s authority to proceed against nonresident defendants.

We now address these categories in greater detail.\n\n                               1. General Jurisdiction\n\n\u00b616   General jurisdiction, or all-purpose jurisdiction, permits a court to exercise\n\njurisdiction over a defendant for any and all causes of action arising from any of the\n\ndefendant\u2019s activities, even if those activities occurred outside the forum state. Daimler,\n\n134 S. Ct. at 754 (citing Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at 318, and Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919).\n\nHowever, \u201conly a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant\n\namenable to all-purpose jurisdiction there.\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 760. For a corporate\n\ndefendant, the paradigmatic fora for general jurisdiction are the corporation\u2019s place of\n\nincorporation and principal place of business. Id. at 760\u201361 (citing Goodyear, 564 U.S.\n\nat 924). These places have the benefit of being unique and easily ascertainable, and a\n\ncorporation may reasonably anticipate being haled into court in either place. Id. Thus,\n\ngeneral jurisdiction guarantees plaintiffs at least one forum to file any suit against a\n\ncorporation. Id.\n\n\u00b617   A state may also exercise general jurisdiction over a nonresident corporate\n\ndefendant whose affiliations with the forum state are \u201cso \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as\n\n                                            8\n\fto render them essentially at home in the forum State.\u201d Id. at 754 (quoting Goodyear,\n\n564 U.S. at 919). A nonresident defendant\u2019s contacts with the state will rarely justify\n\nexercising general jurisdiction. See id. at 757-58. \u201cPerkins v. Benguet [Consolidated]\n\nMining Co.[, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104972\"><a href=\"/opinion/104972/perkins-v-benguet-consol-mining-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1952),] remains the textbook case of general jurisdiction\n\nappropriately exercised over a foreign corporation that has not consented to suit in the\n\nforum.\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 755-56 (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 927\u201328). In Perkins,\n\nthe defendant company was incorporated in the Philippines and operated gold and\n\nsilver mines there. 342 U.S. at 448. During World War II, the company\u2019s president\n\nmoved to Ohio, where he maintained an office with the company\u2019s files and oversaw\n\nthe company\u2019s activities. Id. at 447-48. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the company\n\nhad temporarily moved its principal place of business to Ohio, and therefore, the court\n\nin Ohio did not offend due process by exercising general jurisdiction over the company.\n\nDaimler, 134 S. Ct. at 756 (citing Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111116\"><a href=\"/opinion/111116/keeton-v-hustler-magazine-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 780 n.11\n\n(1984)).\n\n\u00b618    Recently, in Daimler, the U.S. Supreme Court clarified the law of general\n\npersonal jurisdiction as applied to nonresident, corporate defendants. 134 S. Ct. at 746.\n\nThe Court considered whether California had jurisdiction over a claim \u201cbrought by\n\nforeign plaintiffs against a foreign defendant based on events occurring entirely out of\n\nthe United States.\u201d Id. at 750. The plaintiffs argued that the California court had\n\njurisdiction over the corporate defendant, Daimler, based on one of its subsidiary\u2019s\n\ncontacts with the state. Id. at 751. The Court assumed that the subsidiary, MBUSA, was\n\n\u201cat home\u201d in California. Id. at 760. It also assumed that MBUSA\u2019s contacts with\n\n                                            9\n\fCalifornia\u2014including a regional office and other facilities in California, along with\n\nsignificant sales in the state\u2014could be imputed to Daimler. Id. Nevertheless, the Court\n\nconcluded that, even though MBUSA was \u201cat home\u201d in California and all of MBUSA\u2019s\n\ncontacts could be imputed to Daimler, there was \u201cno basis to subject Daimler to general\n\njurisdiction in California, for Daimler\u2019s slim contacts with the State hardly render it at\n\nhome there.\u201d Id. The Court recognized that even if a company conducts significant\n\nbusiness in a state, if that business represents a relatively small portion of the\n\ncompany\u2019s national or international reach, then the company cannot be considered at\n\nhome in the state. Id. at 760\u201361, 761 n.19, 762 n.20. Therefore, because Daimler\u2019s\n\ncontacts with California\u2014while independently substantial\u2014were only a small portion\n\nof its overall business, Daimler could not be considered \u201cat home\u201d in California.1 Id. at\n\n762.\n\n\u00b619    In the case before us, the trial court concluded that Daimler did not control and\n\nthat exercising general jurisdiction over Ford was appropriate. First, it distinguished\n\nthis case by noting that Daimler involved international disputes with foreign plaintiffs.\n\nBut Daimler cannot be disposed of so easily.         Whether a nonresident corporate\n\ndefendant is a resident of another country or another state is irrelevant to the general\n\njurisdiction inquiry. Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919 (recognizing that the test for exercising\n\n1 The Tenth Circuit recently noted that Daimler did not create a new rule for general\npersonal jurisdiction but merely \u201creaffirmed the Goodyear standard.\u201d Am.

Whether Daimler amounted to a sea change in personal jurisdiction\njurisprudence or merely reaffirmed existing law is beyond the scope of this case. We\nneed only determine whether Ford\u2019s contacts supported the conclusion that Ford is at\nhome in Colorado. See Daimler, 134 S.

It also noted that Ford maintains\n\noffices and businesses in Colorado, has a registered agent in Colorado, and trains and\n\ncertifies mechanics to work with Colorado consumers. The trial court added that \u201cFord\n\nhas actively litigated, as both a plaintiff and defendant[,] in cases in Colorado.\u201d These\n\ncontacts, however, pale in comparison to the significant contacts that were deemed\n\n\u201cslim\u201d in Daimler.\n\n\u00b621    In Daimler, the Court imputed MBUSA\u2019s substantial contacts to Daimler and\n\nnevertheless determined that those contacts were \u201cslim\u201d and therefore insufficient to\n\nsupport general jurisdiction.   134 S. Ct. at 760.   These \u201cslim\u201d contacts included a\n\nregional office and other facilities in the state. Id. at 752. MBUSA was also the largest\n\nsupplier of luxury vehicles in California\u2014\u201cover 10% of all sales of new vehicles in the\n\nUnited States\u201d took place in California and \u201c2.4% of Daimler\u2019s worldwide sales\u201d were\n\nattributable to California. Id. A comparison between Ford\u2019s contacts with Colorado\n\nand those in Daimler\u2014which were deemed insufficient to support general\n\njurisdiction\u2014reveals that Ford\u2019s contacts with Colorado do not subject it to general\n\njurisdiction here.\n\n\u00b622    Under Goodyear and Daimler, the key inquiry is whether Ford is \u201cat home\u201d in\n\nColorado. Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 761 (citing Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 919). Determining\n\n                                           11\n\fthat a corporation is \u201cat home\u201d simply because it does business in Colorado would be\n\n\u201cunacceptably grasping.\u201d     Id. at 760\u201361.    \u201cGeneral jurisdiction instead calls for an\n\nappraisal of a corporation\u2019s activities in their entirety, nationwide and worldwide.

June 3, 2015) (\u201cUnder Daimler, then, it is no\n\nlonger enough for the defendant to have \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 contacts with the\n\nforum state . . . . Daimler requires at the very least that a defendant have systematic and\n\ncontinuous contacts with the forum that sets the forum apart from other states where\n\n[the] defendant may conduct business\u2014contacts that render the forum in some manner\n\nequivalent to a principal place of business.\u201d (citations omitted)).\n\n\u00b623    Under Daimler, the record in this case does not support a finding that general\n\njurisdiction over Ford is appropriate. As was true of the defendant in Daimler, Ford\n\nconducts business throughout the country, but the Magills failed to present any\n\nevidence that Ford\u2019s contacts with Colorado are somehow different or more substantial\n\nthan its contacts with other states where it sells cars. Nothing about Ford\u2019s contacts\n\nwith Colorado suggest that it is \u201cat home\u201d here. Moreover, no special circumstances\u2014\n\nsuch as temporarily relocating the company\u2019s principal place of business during\n\nwartime\u2014indicate that this is an \u201cexceptional case\u201d that would render Ford at home in\n\nColorado.

Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred by exercising general\n\njurisdiction over Ford. However, our conclusion that Ford is not subject to general\n\npersonal jurisdiction does not compel the conclusion that the Magills have no recourse\n\nin Colorado; Ford may be subject to specific personal jurisdiction.\n\n                                 2. Specific Jurisdiction\n\n\u00b625    \u201cSpecific jurisdiction has become the centerpiece of modern jurisdiction theory,\n\nwhile general jurisdiction [has played] a reduced role.\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 755 (citing\n\nGoodyear, 564 U.S. at 925). A corporation\u2019s \u201ccontinuous activity of some sorts within a\n\nstate is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits\n\nunrelated to that activity.\u201d Daimler, 134 S. Ct. at 757 (quoting Int\u2019l Shoe, 326 U.S. at\n\n318). But a state may still exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident corporate defendant if\n\nthe cause of action arises out of the defendant\u2019s in-state activities. Id. at 754 (citing Int\u2019l\n\nShoe, 326 U.S. at 317). Some activities\u2014such as having agency relationships within the\n\nforum state or placing products into the stream of commerce\u2014may support a finding of\n\nspecific, but not general, jurisdiction. See, e.g., Daimler, 134 S.

Venue\n\n\u00b627    We now turn to Ford\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by concluding that\n\nvenue is proper in Denver County. The trial court concluded that, because Ford has a\n\nregistered agent in Denver, the company resides there. Therefore, it held that venue\n\nwas proper under C.R.C.P. 98(c)(1). We disagree.\n\n\u00b628    For a tort action, C.R.C.P. 98(c) dictates the proper location for venue:\n\n       [A]n action shall be tried in the county in which the defendants, or any of\n       them, may reside at the commencement of the action, or in the county\n       where the plaintiff resides when service is made on the defendant in such\n       county; or if the defendant is a nonresident of this state, the same may be\n       tried in any county in which the defendant may be found in this state, or\n       in the county designated in the complaint . . . .\n\nThe rule also states that a tort action may \u201cbe tried in the county where the tort was\n\ncommitted.\u201d C.R.C.P. 98(c)(5). \u201cA harmonious construction of the rule requires that,\n\nwhen at least one defendant is a Colorado resident, [a] plaintiff may not designate a\n\ncounty that is unrelated to either the defendant\u2019s county of residence, the plaintiff\u2019s\n\n\n                                             14\n\fcounty of residence, or the county in which a tort occurred.\u201d Denver Air Ctr., 839 P.2d\n\nat 1185.\n\n\u00b629    The trial court concluded that Ford resides in Denver because its registered agent\n\nis located there. To bolster the trial court\u2019s holding, the Magills cite a litany of cases\n\nfrom other states where the court concluded that a corporation \u201cresided\u201d where its\n\nregistered agent was located. However, the decisions in all of these cases rely on state\n\nstatutes or rules.2\n\n\n\n2 See WBC Holdings, Inc. v.

Const. art. XV, \u00a7 10. Nothing in this language suggests that\n\ncomplying with the constitutional requirement to maintain a registered agent converts a\n\nnonresident corporate defendant into a resident. See id.

Therefore, Ford\u2019s maintenance of a registered agent in Denver does not\n\nconvert it into a Denver resident.\n\n\u00b631    A straightforward application of the Denver Air Center rule reveals that venue is\n\nnot proper in Denver County. See 839 P.2d at 1185. Under Denver Air Center, \u201cwhen\n\nat least one defendant is a Colorado resident, plaintiff may not designate a county that\n\nis unrelated to either the defendant\u2019s county of residence, the plaintiff\u2019s county of\n\nresidence, or the county in which a tort occurred.\u201d Id. at 1185. The Magills reside in\n\nDouglas County, Mr. Polunci resides in El Paso County, and, as we have established,\n\nFord is a nonresident defendant.

We also reverse the trial court\u2019s holding that venue is proper in Denver\n\nCounty. Accordingly, we make the rule to show cause absolute.
