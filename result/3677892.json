D. B. Teague, who found the facts and reported same, together with his conclusions of law, to the court, allowing the plaintiff a recovery, after deductions awarded on defendant's counterclaim, of $4,367.01.</p>\n<p>Upon exceptions duly filed and heard at the December Term, 1927, Moore Superior Court, the same were overruled, and the referee's findings of fact and conclusions of law were adopted and approved, from which judgment the defendant appeals, assigning errors.\nIt is settled by all the authorities that the findings of fact, made by a referee and approved by the trial judge, are not subject to review on appeal, if they are supported by any competent evidence. <em>Dorsey v.

Likewise, where the judge, upon hearing and considering exceptions to a referee's report, makes different or additional findings of fact, they afford no ground for exception on appeal, unless there is no sufficient evidence to support them, or error has been committed in receiving or rejecting testimony on which they are based, or some other question of law is raised with respect to said findings. <em>Kenney</em><em>v.
