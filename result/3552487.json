The testimony neither of eye-witnesses nor of experts was indispensable to the recovery of damages by the plaintiff, as contended by the defendants. When a material fact is not proved by direct testimony, it may be inferred by the jury, if there is a case for them, from the facts which have been so proved, even though the inference be not a necessary one. It is their province to draw proper inferences from such facts, and if in the exercise of this right they conclude that the fact in controversy is established, it is as properly proved as if by direct testimony.

Doherty, <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span></cross_reference>, 217. And even if eye-witnesses had been produced at the trial who saw the deceased while drowning and noted his apparent condition, it would be an inference only upon the question of the extent and duration of his pain and suffering; and so it would be with the opinions of experts. If, therefore, all had been done which the defendants contend should have been done to entitle the plaintiff to a recovery, nothing would have been proved by direct testimony; and if there had been, the facts so proved would have been no more competent evidence for the consideration of the jury than those found by them to be proved inferentially from the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 472</span> \nuncontroverted cause and manner of the intestate's death, because \"a fact proved by a legitimate inference is proved no less than when it is directly sworn to.\" Doyle, Adm'r, v.

The authorities uniformly hold, upon grounds of public policy, that the testimony of jurors is not admissible to impeach their verdict (Smith v.
