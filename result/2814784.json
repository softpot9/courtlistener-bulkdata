Willis, Judge\n\n                               Mark S. Gardner (Gardner & Haney, P.C., on briefs), for appellant.\n\n                               David M. Uberman, Assistant Attorney General (Mark R. Herring,\n                               Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.\n\n\n                     A judge convicted Ronald Edward Johnson, Jr. of three counts of felony failure to appear.\n\n              Johnson alleges that conviction of more than one count violated the Double Jeopardy clauses of\n\n              the United States Constitution and the Virginia Constitution. We disagree and affirm.\n\n                                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n                     On appeal of a criminal conviction, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\n              Commonwealth, and draw all reasonable inferences flowing from those facts. Derr v.\n\n              Commonwealth, 242 Va. 413, 424, 410 S.E.2d 662, 668 (1991). So viewed, the facts are as\n\n              follows.\n\n                     Johnson was served with three felony warrants charging forgery, uttering, and attempting\n\n              to obtain money by false pretenses, and was required to appear for preliminary hearing on those\n\n              charges in the Fredericksburg General District Court on June 20, 2013. He did not do so. In\n\n\n                     *\n                         Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-413, this opinion is not designated for publication.\n\f2014 a Fredericksburg grand jury returned three felony indictments charging Johnson with\n\nfailure to appear in the general district court on June 20, 2013, in violation of Code\n\n\u00a7 19.2-128(B). The three indictments alleged, respectively, that he failed to appear \u201cas required\n\non the felony charge of attempt to obtain money by false pretenses,\u201d \u201cas required on the felony\n\ncharge of forgery,\u201d and \u201cas required on the felony charge of uttering.\u201d\n\n       Johnson moved to dismiss two of the three counts, arguing that conviction of more than\n\none count violated the Double Jeopardy clauses of the United States Constitution and the\n\nVirginia Constitution. The circuit court denied his motion. Ultimately, Johnson entered\n\nconditional guilty pleas to the three charges and noted his appeal to this Court.\n\n                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n                                      A. Standard of Review\n\n       \u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s application of a statute de novo.\u201d Bowling v. Commonwealth,\n\n51 Va. App. 102, 108, 654 S.E.2d 354, 357 (2007). Similarly, \u201c[w]e review de novo claims that\n\nmultiple punishments have been imposed for the same offense in violation of the double\n\njeopardy clause.\u201d Lawlor v. Commonwealth, 285 Va. 187, 227, 738 S.E.2d 847, 870 (2013).\n\n                                    B. Rules 5A:18 and 2:201\n\n       Before addressing Code \u00a7 19.2-128 and double jeopardy, we resolve several procedural\n\nissues. In his brief, for the first time on appeal, Johnson attempts to buttress his double jeopardy\n\nargument in part by stressing that he endorsed only one written promise to appear1 when he\n\n\n\n       1\n          Johnson attaches to his brief and labels \u201cAddendum, Exhibit 1\u201d a copy of the front and\nback of a district court recognizance form (Form DC-330). The form appears to be connected to\nJohnson\u2019s three underlying felonies, and appears to show the signatures of Johnson, his bail\nbondsman, and the magistrate, confirming that Johnson was released from incarceration and\nadmitted to bail with a secured bond of $3,000. In the interest of simplicity, we use the term\n\u201cbond paperwork\u201d to describe the recognizance form throughout this opinion, though the more\naccurate phrase is \u201cpurported bond paperwork,\u201d since such document was never authenticated or\njudicially noticed in the circuit court.\n                                                -2-\n\fposted bail for the three underlying felony charges in the general district court. We agree with\n\nthe Commonwealth that Rule 5A:18 forecloses consideration of this argument.\n\n        Rule 5A:18 reads, in relevant part:\n\n                No ruling of the trial court or the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation\n                Commission will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an\n                objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the\n                ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of\n                Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\n\nWe do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. McLean v. Commonwealth, 30\n\nVa. App. 322, 329, 516 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1999). This remains true even if an appellant raised\n\nrelated arguments in the trial court. See Edwards v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 752, 760, 589\n\nS.E.2d 444, 448 (2003) (en banc) (\u201cMaking one specific argument on an issue does not preserve\n\na separate legal point on the same issue for review.\u201d). By failing to make an argument in the\n\ncircuit court based on the bond paperwork, Johnson waived any such argument in this Court.\n\n        Johnson urges us to use the ends of justice exception in Rule 5A:18 to consider the bond\n\npaperwork and his arguments surrounding it. To use the ends of justice exception in this manner\n\nwould be to misapply the exception, and we decline to do so. We employ the ends of justice\n\nexception to consider an inadequately preserved objection, not to consider physical evidence\n\nwhich an appellant never introduced in the trial court.\n\n        Citing Rule 2:201, Johnson asks us to take judicial notice of the bond paperwork. Rule\n\n2:201 states, in relevant part:\n\n                (a) Notice. A court may take judicial notice of a factual matter not\n                subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) common\n                knowledge or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by\n                resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\n                (b) Time of taking notice. Judicial notice may be taken at any stage\n                of the proceeding.\n\nThe broad wording of subsection (b) permits us to take judicial notice of \u201ca factual matter.\u201d But\n\nwhen that matter is a document (other than this Court\u2019s own records), our authority is\n                                               -3-\n\fcircumscribed by what the trial court relied upon when it took judicial notice of such document.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Woodward, 249 Va. 21, 23, 452 S.E.2d 656, 657 (1995) (striking a\n\n44-page addendum attached by the Commonwealth to its brief in a Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\n\nappeal, and explaining that \u201can appellate court may not take judicial notice of such documents\n\nwhen they were not relied upon before the court or commission below\u201d). That the document\n\npurports to be a record of a lower court does not provide any additional weight to Johnson\u2019s\n\njudicial notice argument. Plummer v. Commonwealth, 211 Va. 706, 707, 180 S.E.2d 519, 520\n\n(1971) (per curiam) (agreeing that an appellate court may take judicial notice of its own records,\n\nbut stating \u201cwe are without authority to take such notice of the records of the lower court\u201d). The\n\nbond paperwork was not \u201crelied upon before the court\u201d below, so we will not take judicial notice\n\nof it now.2\n\n                                       C. Double Jeopardy\n\n       Johnson claims that his conviction of more than one count of failure to appear violated\n\nthe Double Jeopardy clauses of the United States Constitution and the Virginia Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions provide that no\n\nperson shall be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense.\u201d Martin v. Commonwealth, 221 Va.\n\n720, 722, 273 S.E.2d 778, 780 (1981). The prohibition against double jeopardy \u201cembodies three\n\nguarantees: \u2018(1) \u201cIt protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.\n\n[(2)] It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. [(3)] And it\n\nprotects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d\u2019\u201d Blythe v. Commonwealth, 222\n\n\n       2\n          Rule 2:201(a) also limits judicial notice in several other ways that preclude the Rule\u2019s\napplicability here. The bond paperwork Johnson supplies is not \u201ccommon knowledge,\u201d and is\nincapable of \u201caccurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot\nreasonably be questioned.\u201d Johnson proposes no procedure by which this Court could determine\nthe accuracy of his addendum. Per Rule 5A:25(h), we may consider documents included in the\nrecord but left out of the appendix. See Cabral v. Cabral, 62 Va. App. 600, 604 n.1, 751 S.E.2d\n4, 7 n.1 (2013). Here, the bond paperwork appears in neither the appendix nor the record.\n                                                 -4-\n\fVa. 722, 725, 284 S.E.2d 796, 797 (1981) (quoting Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U.S. 410, 415 (1980)\n\n(footnotes omitted) (quoting North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969))). Here we\n\naddress the third of these guarantees, which bars multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\n       Though multiple punishments for the same offense are constitutionally prohibited,\n\n\u201c\u2018conduct may constitute more than one violation of a single criminal proscription.\u2019\u201d Sandoval\n\nv. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 398, 417, 768 S.E.2d 709, 718-19 (2015) (quoting Jordan v.\n\nCommonwealth, 2 Va. App. 590, 593, 347 S.E.2d 152, 154 (1986)). As this Court stated in\n\nJordan, it is the legislature that decides how crime is punished:\n\n               The legislature in its discretion may determine the appropriate\n               \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d and set the penalty for separate\n               violations . . . . Where the legislature has authorized cumulative\n               punishments, regardless of whether the offenses are the \u201csame,\u201d\n               the prosecutor may seek and the trial court may impose cumulative\n               punishments in a single trial.\n\nJordan, 2 Va. App. at 594, 347 S.E.2d at 154 (citations omitted) (footnote omitted). For the\n\nreasons that follow, we hold that the legislature intended the unit of prosecution in Code\n\n\u00a7 19.2-128(B) to correspond to the number of underlying offenses for which a defendant is\n\nobligated to appear.\n\n                                      1. Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B)\n\n       \u201c\u2018The multiple punishments prohibition . . . remains from start to finish wholly dependent\n\non statutory interpretation.\u2019\u201d Sandoval, 64 Va. App. at 417, 768 S.E.2d at 718-19 (quoting\n\nDe\u2019Armond v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 26, 33, 654 S.E.2d 317, 320 (2007)). Code\n\n\u00a7 19.2-128(B) states: \u201cAny person (i) charged with a felony offense or (ii) convicted of a felony\n\noffense and execution of sentence is suspended pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-319 who willfully fails to\n\nappear before any court as required shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.\u201d Johnson failed to appear\n\nfor his preliminary hearing on three pending felonies, so subsection (i) addresses his conduct.\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f        \u201cThe Virginia Supreme Court has long held that \u2018[w]hen analyzing a statute, we must\n\nassume that \u201cthe legislature chose, with care, the words it used . . . and we are bound by those\n\nwords as we interpret the statute.\u201d\u2019\u201d Hodges v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., Div. of Child Support\n\nEnforcement, 45 Va. App. 118, 126, 609 S.E.2d 61, 64-65 (2005) (quoting City of Va. Beach v.\n\nESG Enters., 243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (quoting Barr v. Town and Country\n\nProps., Inc., 240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990))).\n\n       We must presume that the legislature\u2019s decision to include or leave out even a single\n\nletter or word in a statute is intentional and meaningful. See, e.g., Tiller v. Commonwealth, 193\n\nVa. 418, 422-23, 69 S.E.2d 441, 443-44 (1952) (analyzing the legislative decision to use the\n\nphrase \u201cdual wheels\u201d instead of \u201cdual wheel\u201d in \u00a7 46-334 of the Code); Posey v.\n\nCommonwealth, 123 Va. 551, 554-55, 96 S.E. 771, 772 (1918) (interpreting a taxation statute\n\nand the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201crates,\u201d as opposed to \u201crate,\u201d and noting that inclusion of a\n\nplural word instead of a singular word \u201ccould not have been an \u2018inadvertence of the draftsman,\u2019\n\nas contended by counsel\u201d).\n\n       Here, the legislature chose to criminalize the failure to appear of anyone charged \u201cwith a\n\nfelony offense,\u201d rather than, for example, \u201cwith any felony offense\u201d or \u201cwith felony offenses.\u201d\n\nIn Mason v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 39, 636 S.E.2d 480 (2006), the defendant was\n\nconvicted of multiple counts of possession of child pornography with the intent to distribute.\n\nShe argued that the trial court erred in finding the unit of prosecution corresponded to the\n\nnumber of individual images possessed. In affirming her convictions, this Court discussed the\n\nimportance of the legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201ca\u201d in determining the intended unit of\n\nprosecution:\n\n               [b]y using the word \u201ca\u201d followed by a succession of singular nouns\n               in the definition of \u201csexually explicit visual material\u201d in Code\n               \u00a7 18.2-374.1(A), the Virginia legislature has demonstrated its clear\n               intent that possession of a single photograph could constitute an\n                                                -6-\n\f               offense under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1 and that multiple punishments\n               would result from multiple violations of the statute. Accordingly,\n               we conclude that the permissible unit of prosecution for possession\n               of child pornography under Code \u00a7 18.2-374.1(B)(4) corresponds\n               to the number of individual items of sexually explicit visual\n               material.\n\nId. at 48, 636 S.E.2d at 484 (footnote omitted). The reasoning in Mason is applicable in this\n\ncase. The legislature\u2019s use of the words \u201ca felony offense\u201d evinced an intent that the unit of\n\nprosecution for failure to appear corresponds to the number of individual felony offenses for\n\nwhich a defendant is obligated to appear.\n\n       Johnson argues that Code \u00a7 19.2-128 must be strictly construed against the\n\nCommonwealth because of the doctrine of lenity. Lenity is a rule of statutory construction\n\nrequiring that a court resolve ambiguities in penal statutes in the defendant\u2019s favor. See Jones v.\n\nCommonwealth, 64 Va. App. 361, 367 n.2, 768 S.E.2d 270, 273 n.2 (2015). Barring statutory\n\nambiguity, we are \u201cbound by the plain meaning of unambiguous statutory language and \u2018may not\n\nassign a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly did not mean what it\n\nactually has stated.\u2019\u201d Gunn v. Commonwealth, 272 Va. 580, 587, 637 S.E.2d 324, 327 (2006)\n\n(quoting Williams v. Commonwealth, 265 Va. 268, 271, 576 S.E.2d 468, 470 (2003)); see also\n\nDe\u2019Armond, 51 Va. App. at 36, 654 S.E.2d at 322 (noting that appellant\u2019s \u201cproffered statutory\n\nconstruction . . . does not clarify ambiguous statutory language, but rather rewrites unambiguous\n\nstatutory language\u201d). We cannot create ambiguity by straining to interpret a statute whose\n\nunderstanding requires no such exertion. Since we find no ambiguity to resolve within Code\n\n\u00a7 19.2-128, lenity has no place in our analysis.\n\n                                   2. Cases From Other States\n\n       Neither this Court nor the Supreme Court has directly addressed the question presented.\n\nJohnson refers us to cases from several other states, as does the Commonwealth. Johnson urges\n\nus to adopt the reasoning of the First District Court of Appeal of Florida, as enunciated in McGee\n                                                   -7-\n\fv. State, 438 So.2d 127 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983), where that court held: \u201cThe gravamen of the\n\noffense is the failure to appear at the time and place specified, not how many offenses or cases\n\nare pending and scheduled for disposition on that particular occasion.\u201d Id. at 131.\n\n        Johnson also cites Lennon v. United States, 736 A.2d 208 (D.C. 1999), from the District\n\nof Columbia Court of Appeals. The court in Lennon framed the issue as \u201cwhether the legislative\n\nintent behind [the failure to appear statute] is to punish the single act of failing to appear for a\n\nunitary court proceeding or the two separate acts of not appearing for trial on each underlying\n\ncharge.\u201d Id. at 210. That court held that a defendant who is released on a single notice to appear\n\nand fails to appear for a single hearing may be convicted of only one count of failure to appear,\n\neven if he was to have appeared to face multiple underlying charges. Id. at 212.3\n\n        The Commonwealth urges us to look to Connecticut and Wisconsin. In State v. Garvin,\n\n682 A.2d 562 (Conn. App. Ct. 1996), a case decided by the Appellate Court of Connecticut,4 the\n\ndefendant failed to appear for sentencing on multiple charges, and was ultimately convicted of\n\nmultiple counts of failing to appear. Id. at 564-65. Garvin held that multiple convictions were\n\nappropriate, as each charge of failure to appear related to a separate underlying felony:\n\n                Failure to appear pursuant to the statute requires proof of an\n                underlying crime . . . . Had the legislature intended to punish only\n                the act of failing to appear, it would not have added the element of\n                \u201cwhile charged with the commission of a felony.\u201d Each failure to\n                appear relates to the underlying charge for which the individual\n                failed to appear.\n\n                                       *   *   *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n        3\n         This holding was based in part on the defendant\u2019s signature of a single notice to appear.\nFor the reasons explained in Part II.B., we do not consider Johnson\u2019s single notice argument.\n        4\n        The Appellate Court of Connecticut is an intermediate appellate court. The case cited\nby the Commonwealth was subsequently appealed to the court of last resort in that state, the\nSupreme Court of Connecticut, which affirmed the Appellate Court of Connecticut, \u201con\nsomewhat different grounds.\u201d See State v. Garvin, 699 A.2d 921, 924 (Conn. 1997).\n                                            -8-\n\f                 In order for double jeopardy to exist there must be a dual\n                 punishment of the same offense arising out of the same act. Here,\n                 there was one act, a failure to appear on a given day, but two\n                 offenses because each charge of failure to appear involved an\n                 element that the other did not, namely, being charged with the\n                 commission of separate felonies.\n\nId. at 566-67.\n\n        Finally, the Commonwealth cites State v. Eaglefeathers, 762 N.W.2d 690 (Wis. Ct. App.\n\n2008).5 Eaglefeathers, from the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, addressed charges of \u201cbail\n\njumping\u201d and found that \u201c\u2018[e]ach count would require proof of facts for conviction which the\n\nother two counts would not require\u2019 giving rise \u2018to an individual factual inquiry\u2019 for each count\n\nof bail jumping.\u201d Id. at 695 (quoting State v. Richter, 525 N.W.2d 168, 170 (Wis. Ct. App.\n\n1994)). Eaglefeathers also observed that the defendant \u201cfails to acknowledge that his conduct\n\nresulted in two separate wrongs, preventing the court from proceeding with preliminary hearings\n\nin two separate cases. Under such circumstances, multiple punishments are not inappropriate.\u201d\n\nId. at 696.\n\n        While we acknowledge that our sister states are divided on this question, we agree with\n\nthe logic of the Appellate Court of Connecticut and the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin. The\n\nCommonwealth in the case at bar was required to prove notice to Johnson as to each instance of\n\nfailure to appear. The Commonwealth was also required to prove that, as to each failure to\n\nappear charge, Johnson had been charged with an underlying felony. The Court of Appeals of\n\nWisconsin is correct to point out the \u201cwrongs\u201d that accrue when one fails to appear to answer for\n\nmultiple charges. Johnson\u2019s failure to appear hampered the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to proceed\n\n\n\n\n        5\n        This case, too, comes from an intermediate court of appeal, although Eaglefeathers,\nunlike Garvin, was not appealed further.\n                                             -9-\n\fon multiple charges, making multiple punishments for such failures to appear all the more\n\nappropriate.6\n\n                       3. Virginia Cases Addressing Multiple Punishments\n\n        Various Virginia cases address multiple punishments for single acts. Johnson cites two\n\nof these cases in support of his position, but we find his examples distinguishable from his own\n\ncase.\n\n        In Acey v. Commonwealth, 29 Va. App. 240, 511 S.E.2d 429 (1999), this Court held that\n\na defendant who simultaneously possessed multiple firearms could only be convicted of one\n\ncount of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. This Court found the statute ambiguous in\n\nAcey. Id. at 249-50, 511 S.E.2d at 433. Here, we do not find \u00a7 19.2-128 of the Code\n\nambiguous. The legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ca felony\u201d in \u00a7 19.2-128 of the Code leads us to\n\nconclude that multiple punishments are permitted. See Part II.C.1. By contrast, the statutory\n\nlanguage at issue in Acey, from Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), addressed the phrase \u201cany firearm\u201d and\n\nread in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felony\n\n. . . to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm . . . .\u201d Acey, 29 Va. App. at\n\n249 n.3, 511 S.E.2d at 433 n.3 (emphasis added).\n\n        Johnson also cites Lane v. Commonwealth, 51 Va. App. 565, 659 S.E.2d 553 (2008), for\n\nthe proposition that one must possess multiple intents to be convicted of multiple counts of the\n\nsame crime. In Lane, the defendant was charged with \u201cthree counts of possession with the intent\n\n\n\n        6\n          Between the date of Johnson\u2019s preliminary hearing on the three underlying felonies (for\nwhich he failed to appear) and the date of his ultimate apprehension on the failure to appear\ncharges, the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness (the victim) on the three initial underlying felony\ncharges passed away. Because of the victim\u2019s death, the Commonwealth ultimately moved for\nentry of orders of nolle prosequi as to those three underlying felony charges. We note that, if we\nwere to adopt Johnson\u2019s position now, he would incidentally profit from his initial failure to\nappear by escaping the possibility of conviction of the three underlying felonies in exchange for\njust one felony failure to appear.\n                                                - 10 -\n\fto distribute a Schedule II controlled substance (one count for liquid oxycodone, one count for\n\nEndocet tablets, which contained oxycodone, and one count for oxycodone tablets).\u201d Id. at 568,\n\n659 S.E.2d at 554. The defendant moved to dismiss two of the three indictments, as Johnson\n\ndoes here, alleging a double jeopardy violation. This Court reversed, holding that the\n\nCommonwealth had not proven that \u201cappellant possessed different demonstrated intents\n\nsufficient to support three separate charges of possession with the intent to distribute\n\noxycodone.\u201d Id. at 582, 659 S.E.2d at 561. Johnson argues that he, like the defendant in Lane,\n\ncommitted but one crime, with a single intent. We do not agree. Though Johnson failed to\n\nappear on a single date and at a single location, he had three different obligations to appear, and\n\nfaced three distinct criminal allegations, with different elements of proof. In failing to appear as\n\nto each underlying felony, he prevented a hearing as to each of the three charges.\n\n       We are persuaded by other decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court upholding\n\nmultiple punishments for single acts. In Jordan, this Court upheld the robbery convictions of a\n\ndefendant who robbed multiple victims at gunpoint simultaneously. This Court highlighted the\n\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s use of the singular word \u201cperson\u201d and looked closely at the language of the\n\nrobbery statute:\n\n               The gravamen of the offense to be punished consists of \u201cviolence\n               to the person\u201d or \u201cputting a person in fear . . . by the . . . presenting\n               of firearms\u201d during the commission of a robbery. The [robbery]\n               statute refers to the victim in the singular and suggests that the\n               General Assembly\u2019s primary purpose was the protection of an\n               individual from violence and fear of harm during a robbery. Thus,\n               the focus must be upon the actions directed toward the person\n               robbed.\n\nJordan, 2 Va. App. at 595, 347 S.E.2d at 155; see also Kelsoe v. Commonwealth, 226 Va. 197,\n\n199, 308 S.E.2d 104, 104 (1983) (per curiam) (upholding multiple brandishing convictions for\n\ndefendant who pointed a gun at three men simultaneously, and holding \u201cwhen the defendant\n\nfrightened the three men by pointing his weapon, he committed three separate crimes\u201d); Shears\n                                                - 11 -\n\fv. Commonwealth, 23 Va. App. 394, 401, 477 S.E.2d 309, 312 (1996) (affirming two\n\nconvictions of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, when one bag of cocaine was\n\nfound in defendant\u2019s pocket, and another on the floor where he had been standing, and noting\n\n\u201c[t]he gravamen of the offense is clearly possession of the specified drug with the requisite\n\nintent\u201d). Like the defendants in Jordan, Kelsoe, and Shears, Johnson\u2019s single act rightly resulted\n\nin multiple charges, as the statute criminalizes not simply a failure to appear, but a failure to\n\nappear as to each underlying charge for which Johnson faced preliminary hearing.\n\n       Finally, in probation violation proceedings pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-306, probationers\n\nwith multiple suspended sentences face revocation of some or all of such sentences. A court\n\nmay order multiple sentences into execution even though the probationer committed only one\n\nviolation, for instance testing positive for drugs, committing a new crime, or absconding from\n\nsupervision. In this way, a single act with a single intent can simultaneously trigger the\n\nre-imposition of previously suspended sentences in multiple cases. When a probationer violates\n\nhis probation, a court does not simply punish the violation, it punishes the violation as to each\n\nunderlying conviction. In each case for which he is on probation, a probationer has a unique\n\nobligation to the court to be of good behavior and to follow the rules of his probation officer. A\n\nprobationer owes such an obligation to the court as to each individual charge for which he is\n\nbeing supervised, just as in our case, Johnson owed an obligation to the general district court to\n\nappear and answer for each pending felony charge.\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n       The trial court did not err in finding Johnson guilty of three counts of felony failure to\n\nappear. A single act of failure to appear may result in multiple convictions for failure to appear,\n\nwhen, as here, each such count is based on a distinct underlying felony. Multiple convictions in\n\nthis case did not violate the Double Jeopardy clauses of the United States Constitution or the\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fVirginia Constitution. Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B) is unambiguous, so Johnson does not receive the\n\nbenefit of the rule of lenity. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n                                                                                    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">                                             COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA\n\n\n              Present: Chief Judge Huff, Judges Beales and AtLee\nUNPUBLISHED\n\n\n              Argued at Richmond, Virginia\n\n\n              RONALD EDWARD JOHNSON, JR.\n                                                                            MEMORANDUM OPINION* BY\n              v.

So viewed, the facts are as\n\n              follows.\n\n                     Johnson was served with three felony warrants charging forgery, uttering, and attempting\n\n              to obtain money by false pretenses, and was required to appear for preliminary hearing on those\n\n              charges in the Fredericksburg General District Court on June 20, 2013. He did not do so. In\n\n\n                     *\n                         Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-413, this opinion is not designated for publication.\n\f2014 a Fredericksburg grand jury returned three felony indictments charging Johnson with\n\nfailure to appear in the general district court on June 20, 2013, in violation of Code\n\n\u00a7 19.2-128(B). The three indictments alleged, respectively, that he failed to appear \u201cas required\n\non the felony charge of attempt to obtain money by false pretenses,\u201d \u201cas required on the felony\n\ncharge of forgery,\u201d and \u201cas required on the felony charge of uttering.\u201d\n\n       Johnson moved to dismiss two of the three counts, arguing that conviction of more than\n\none count violated the Double Jeopardy clauses of the United States Constitution and the\n\nVirginia Constitution. The circuit court denied his motion. Ultimately, Johnson entered\n\nconditional guilty pleas to the three charges and noted his appeal to this Court.\n\n                                          II.

The court in Lennon framed the issue as \u201cwhether the legislative\n\nintent behind [the failure to appear statute] is to punish the single act of failing to appear for a\n\nunitary court proceeding or the two separate acts of not appearing for trial on each underlying\n\ncharge.\u201d Id. at 210. That court held that a defendant who is released on a single notice to appear\n\nand fails to appear for a single hearing may be convicted of only one count of failure to appear,\n\neven if he was to have appeared to face multiple underlying charges.

Id. at 564-65. Garvin held that multiple convictions were\n\nappropriate, as each charge of failure to appear related to a separate underlying felony:\n\n                Failure to appear pursuant to the statute requires proof of an\n                underlying crime . . . . Had the legislature intended to punish only\n                the act of failing to appear, it would not have added the element of\n                \u201cwhile charged with the commission of a felony.\u201d Each failure to\n                appear relates to the underlying charge for which the individual\n                failed to appear.\n\n                                       *   *   *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n        3\n         This holding was based in part on the defendant\u2019s signature of a single notice to appear.\nFor the reasons explained in Part II.B., we do not consider Johnson\u2019s single notice argument.\n        4\n        The Appellate Court of Connecticut is an intermediate appellate court. The case cited\nby the Commonwealth was subsequently appealed to the court of last resort in that state, the\nSupreme Court of Connecticut, which affirmed the Appellate Court of Connecticut, \u201con\nsomewhat different grounds.\u201d See State v.

Ct. App.\n\n1994)). Eaglefeathers also observed that the defendant \u201cfails to acknowledge that his conduct\n\nresulted in two separate wrongs, preventing the court from proceeding with preliminary hearings\n\nin two separate cases. Under such circumstances, multiple punishments are not inappropriate.\u201d\n\nId. at 696.\n\n        While we acknowledge that our sister states are divided on this question, we agree with\n\nthe logic of the Appellate Court of Connecticut and the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin. The\n\nCommonwealth in the case at bar was required to prove notice to Johnson as to each instance of\n\nfailure to appear. The Commonwealth was also required to prove that, as to each failure to\n\nappear charge, Johnson had been charged with an underlying felony. The Court of Appeals of\n\nWisconsin is correct to point out the \u201cwrongs\u201d that accrue when one fails to appear to answer for\n\nmultiple charges. Johnson\u2019s failure to appear hampered the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to proceed\n\n\n\n\n        5\n        This case, too, comes from an intermediate court of appeal, although Eaglefeathers,\nunlike Garvin, was not appealed further.\n                                             -9-\n\fon multiple charges, making multiple punishments for such failures to appear all the more\n\nappropriate.6\n\n                       3. Virginia Cases Addressing Multiple Punishments\n\n        Various Virginia cases address multiple punishments for single acts. Johnson cites two\n\nof these cases in support of his position, but we find his examples distinguishable from his own\n\ncase.\n\n        In Acey v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1066460\"><a href=\"/opinion/1066460/acey-v-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.

This Court found the statute ambiguous in\n\nAcey. Id. at 249-50, 511 S.E.2d at 433. Here, we do not find \u00a7 19.2-128 of the Code\n\nambiguous. The legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ca felony\u201d in \u00a7 19.2-128 of the Code leads us to\n\nconclude that multiple punishments are permitted. See Part II.C.1. By contrast, the statutory\n\nlanguage at issue in Acey, from Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A), addressed the phrase \u201cany firearm\u201d and\n\nread in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a felony\n\n. . . to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm . . . .\u201d Acey, 29 Va. App. at\n\n249 n.3, 511 S.E.2d at 433 n.3 (emphasis added).\n\n        Johnson also cites Lane v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1062813\"><a href=\"/opinion/1062813/lane-v-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.

In Lane, the defendant was charged with \u201cthree counts of possession with the intent\n\n\n\n        6\n          Between the date of Johnson\u2019s preliminary hearing on the three underlying felonies (for\nwhich he failed to appear) and the date of his ultimate apprehension on the failure to appear\ncharges, the Commonwealth\u2019s key witness (the victim) on the three initial underlying felony\ncharges passed away. Because of the victim\u2019s death, the Commonwealth ultimately moved for\nentry of orders of nolle prosequi as to those three underlying felony charges. We note that, if we\nwere to adopt Johnson\u2019s position now, he would incidentally profit from his initial failure to\nappear by escaping the possibility of conviction of the three underlying felonies in exchange for\njust one felony failure to appear.\n                                                - 10 -\n\fto distribute a Schedule II controlled substance (one count for liquid oxycodone, one count for\n\nEndocet tablets, which contained oxycodone, and one count for oxycodone tablets).\u201d Id. at 568,\n\n659 S.E.2d at 554. The defendant moved to dismiss two of the three indictments, as Johnson\n\ndoes here, alleging a double jeopardy violation. This Court reversed, holding that the\n\nCommonwealth had not proven that \u201cappellant possessed different demonstrated intents\n\nsufficient to support three separate charges of possession with the intent to distribute\n\noxycodone.\u201d Id. at 582, 659 S.E.2d at 561. Johnson argues that he, like the defendant in Lane,\n\ncommitted but one crime, with a single intent. We do not agree. Though Johnson failed to\n\nappear on a single date and at a single location, he had three different obligations to appear, and\n\nfaced three distinct criminal allegations, with different elements of proof. In failing to appear as\n\nto each underlying felony, he prevented a hearing as to each of the three charges.\n\n       We are persuaded by other decisions of this Court and the Supreme Court upholding\n\nmultiple punishments for single acts. In Jordan, this Court upheld the robbery convictions of a\n\ndefendant who robbed multiple victims at gunpoint simultaneously. This Court highlighted the\n\nGeneral Assembly\u2019s use of the singular word \u201cperson\u201d and looked closely at the language of the\n\nrobbery statute:\n\n               The gravamen of the offense to be punished consists of \u201cviolence\n               to the person\u201d or \u201cputting a person in fear . . . by the . . . presenting\n               of firearms\u201d during the commission of a robbery. The [robbery]\n               statute refers to the victim in the singular and suggests that the\n               General Assembly\u2019s primary purpose was the protection of an\n               individual from violence and fear of harm during a robbery. Thus,\n               the focus must be upon the actions directed toward the person\n               robbed.\n\nJordan, 2 Va. App. at 595, 347 S.E.2d at 155; see also Kelsoe v.

Like the defendants in Jordan, Kelsoe, and Shears, Johnson\u2019s single act rightly resulted\n\nin multiple charges, as the statute criminalizes not simply a failure to appear, but a failure to\n\nappear as to each underlying charge for which Johnson faced preliminary hearing.\n\n       Finally, in probation violation proceedings pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-306, probationers\n\nwith multiple suspended sentences face revocation of some or all of such sentences. A court\n\nmay order multiple sentences into execution even though the probationer committed only one\n\nviolation, for instance testing positive for drugs, committing a new crime, or absconding from\n\nsupervision. In this way, a single act with a single intent can simultaneously trigger the\n\nre-imposition of previously suspended sentences in multiple cases. When a probationer violates\n\nhis probation, a court does not simply punish the violation, it punishes the violation as to each\n\nunderlying conviction. In each case for which he is on probation, a probationer has a unique\n\nobligation to the court to be of good behavior and to follow the rules of his probation officer. A\n\nprobationer owes such an obligation to the court as to each individual charge for which he is\n\nbeing supervised, just as in our case, Johnson owed an obligation to the general district court to\n\nappear and answer for each pending felony charge.\n\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n\n       The trial court did not err in finding Johnson guilty of three counts of felony failure to\n\nappear. A single act of failure to appear may result in multiple convictions for failure to appear,\n\nwhen, as here, each such count is based on a distinct underlying felony. Multiple convictions in\n\nthis case did not violate the Double Jeopardy clauses of the United States Constitution or the\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fVirginia Constitution.
