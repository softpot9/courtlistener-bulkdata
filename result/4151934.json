The district\ncourt granted Ditech\u2019s motion to dismiss and denied the Smithers\u2019 motion for\nreconsideration. We AFFIRM.\n              I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      In 2006, John and Patricia Smither executed a home equity loan (the\nLoan), which was secured by their homestead in Houston, Texas (the\nProperty). 1 The Smithers divorced in 2007, and John transferred his interest\nin the Property to Patricia, retaining a lien on the Property pursuant to the\ndivorce decree. In July 2009, Bank of America, the then mortgagee, sent\nnotices of acceleration to the Smithers (the 2009 Acceleration) and, in August\n2009, applied in state district court for an order allowing it to proceed with\nforeclosure (the 2009 Foreclosure Suit). Patricia filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy\npetition in September 2009, and Bank of America dismissed the 2009\nForeclosure Suit without prejudice in December 2009. Patricia\u2019s bankruptcy\npetition was dismissed in January 2010, but she refiled for bankruptcy shortly\nthereafter.    On July 20, 2010, the bankruptcy court confirmed Patricia\u2019s\nbankruptcy plan, which provided for Patricia\u2019s surrender of the Property to\nDitech Financial, L.L.C., the then-and-current mortgagee. However, in June\n2011, Patricia\u2019s bankruptcy plan was amended to allow her to resume payment\non the Loan. Patricia did not, however, resume payment, and on November 6,\n2015, following the discharge of Patricia\u2019s other debts in her bankruptcy case,\nDitech filed a new application for foreclosure in state district court (the 2015\nForeclosure Suit).\n      On November 20, 2015, the Smithers filed the instant suit against Ditech\nin state district court. The Smithers requested a declaration that Ditech\u2019s \u201clien\n\n\n      1 This factual background is drawn from the allegations in the Smithers\u2019 pleadings,\nwhich the court must accept as true in considering whether dismissal was appropriate.

After timely removing the lawsuit to federal district court on the basis\nof diversity jurisdiction, Ditech moved for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6). In pertinent part, Ditech argued that Bank of America\u2019s\nvoluntary dismissal of the 2009 Foreclosure Suit constituted abandonment of\nthe 2009 Acceleration, thereby restoring the Loan\u2019s maturity date to its\noriginal condition and rendering the 2015 Foreclosure Suit timely. Ditech also\nargued that the Smithers\u2019 TDCA claim failed because, inter alia, it was based\non the Smithers\u2019 mistaken belief that their debt was no longer enforceable.\n       On February 3, 2016, the Smithers filed a response to Ditech\u2019s motion,\nas well as an amended complaint. 3                  The amended complaint contained\n\n\n       2 \u00a7 16.035 states, in part, that \u201c[a] person must bring suit for the recovery of real\nproperty under a real property lien or the foreclosure of a real property lien not later than\nfour years after the day the cause of action accrues.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 16.035(a).\n       3 The parties dispute whether the Smithers\u2019 amended complaint was timely filed\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(B), such that it, rather than the Smithers\u2019\noriginal petition, should be considered in analyzing whether the Smithers stated claims upon\nwhich relief could be granted. Rule 15(a)(1)(B) allows a party to amend its pleadings \u201conce\nas a matter of course within . . . 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after\nservice of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\u201d The Smithers assert\nthat their amended complaint was timely because it was filed within 21 days of Ditech\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss. Ditech counters that the amended complaint was untimely because it was\nfiled more than 21 days after Ditech filed its general denial in state court. We need not, and\n                                                3\n\f     Case: 16-20392       Document: 00513906716         Page: 4     Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-20392\nadditional factual allegations and added two new claims against Ditech. First,\nit added an alternative claim under the TDCA, alleging that, even if Bank of\nAmerica abandoned the 2009 Acceleration, Ditech \u201cmisrepresented the\ncharacter, extent, or amount of a consumer debt in violation of Tex. Fin. Code\n\u00a7 392.304(a)(8)\u201d by not reflecting that abandonment \u201con information provided\nto credit reporting agencies.\u201d Second, it added a claim that Ditech violated the\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) by \u201ccontinuing to report the past-\ndue amounts on the Loan and the foreclosure of the Loan on the [Smithers\u2019]\ncredit reports even though either the debt is no longer enforceable or the\nforeclosure was abandoned.\u201d\n       On April 15, 2016, the district court granted Ditech\u2019s motion to dismiss\nand dismissed the entire case with prejudice. The Smithers timely moved for\nreconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), 4 arguing that the\ndistrict court erred in dismissing their entire case with prejudice because their\namended complaint asserted additional facts and additional causes of actions\nthat were not addressed in Ditech\u2019s motion to dismiss. In response, Ditech\nargued that the Smithers\u2019 amended complaint, like their original petition,\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court\ndenied the Smithers\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion on May 27, and the Smithers timely\nappealed, challenging the \u201cfinal order (judgment) of the District Court for\nSouthern District of Texas, Houston Division, entered in this action on . . . May\n27, 2016, at docket number 18.\u201d\n\n\n\ndo not, resolve this dispute because, as discussed infra, the Smithers\u2019 amended complaint\nand original petition both fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n       4 Although styled as a motion for new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n59(a), we construe the Smithers\u2019 motion as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under\nRule 59(e) because there was no trial.

We begin our analysis with the Smithers\u2019\nclaim that Ditech is time-barred from foreclosing on its lien on the Property.\nA. Claim for Declaratory Relief\n      Under Texas law, \u201c[a] person must bring suit for the recovery of real\nproperty under a real property lien or the foreclosure of a real property lien not\nlater than four years after the day the cause of action accrues.\u201d Tex.

The district court further held that Deutsche\nBank\u2019s subsequent rescission of the November 6, 2007 notice of acceleration\n\n\n\n       6  The Smithers also argue that Bank of America and Ditech made statements\ninconsistent with abandonment of the 2009 Acceleration\u2014namely, that Bank of America and\nDitech reported to credit agencies \u201cthat the Property was in the process of foreclosure or in\nforeclosure\u201d following the voluntary dismissal of the 2009 Foreclosure Suit. According to the\nSmithers\u2019 own argument, however, these statements would be consistent with abandonment\nif Bank of America and Ditech did, in fact, provide separate acceleration notices.

Significantly, the district court\u2019s\nopinion in Callan II omitted the holding in Callan I that Deutsche Bank did\nnot abandon acceleration of the note when it dismissed the 2008 foreclosure\naction\u2014the holding upon which the Smithers almost entirely rest their case.\nCallan II, 93 F. Supp. 3d at 737\u201338.\n      But even if the Smithers\u2019 reliance on Callan I were not misplaced, the\nSmithers\u2019 position still must be rejected. The Smithers did not allege in either\ntheir original petition or their amended complaint that Ditech did not, in fact,\nprovide them a second set of acceleration notices in connection with the 2015\nForeclosure Suit. Instead, they argue that the absence of an allegation as to\nseparate acceleration notices supports the reasonable inference that no\nseparate acceleration notices were provided and, therefore, that the 2009\nAcceleration was not abandoned. We disagree. The original petition and\namended complaint are devoid of any factual allegations that would support a\nreasonable inference that Ditech did not send separate acceleration notices, 7\n\n\n\n      7 In fact, Ditech has provided the court with separate acceleration notices that were\napparently provided to the Smithers in connection the 2015 Foreclosure Suit and asked that\nwe take judicial notice of them. Because the Smithers\u2019 claim fails regardless of whether we\naccept or reject Ditech\u2019s request to take judicial notice, we need not, and do not, address\n                                            10\n\f    Case: 16-20392       Document: 00513906716         Page: 11     Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-20392\nmuch less support the inference that Bank of America did not abandon the\n2009 Acceleration.       Indeed, the credit reporting activity about which the\nSmithers also complain suggests that the 2009 Acceleration was, in fact,\nabandoned. For instance, in 2013, the Loan was reported as closed with a\ndelinquency of $13,101\u2014far less than the Loan\u2019s accelerated balance of\n$406,323.83. 8 Accordingly, the Smithers failed to state a plausible claim for\ndeclaratory relief.\nB. TDCA Claim\n       In their amended complaint, the Smithers asserted, in relevant part,\nthat Ditech \u201cmisrepresented the character, extent, or amount of a consumer\ndebt in violation of Tex. Fin.

As an initial matter, the Smithers\u2019 position assumes that\nBank of America and Ditech could not subsequently foreclose on the Property to recover on\nonly the unaccelerated, delinquent balance of the Loan. The Smithers, however, have cited\nabsolutely no factual or legal basis for that assumption. Moreover, even if re-acceleration\nwere a prerequisite to a subsequent foreclosure, as the Smithers assume, the pleadings are\ndevoid of any factual allegation that would support the inference that Bank of America and\nDitech did not provide, or would not have provided, separate notices of acceleration, which\nthe Smithers concede would confirm abandonment.\n        9 The Smithers concede that the other TDCA claim asserted in their original petition\n\nand amended complaint\u2014that Ditech violated the TDCA by continuing to report on the\nSmithers\u2019 credit reports past-due amounts on the Loan, even though that debt was no longer\nenforceable\u2014fails in light of our holding that they have not stated a claim for declaratory\nrelief.

Here, the only credit reporting activity that is alleged to\nhave occurred within the one-year limitations period is a report by Greentree\nFinancial Services that foreclosure proceedings were initiated in 2015. The\nSmithers have failed to show how Greentree Financial Services is related to\nDitech or how that specific report was false, deceptive, or otherwise misleading.\nMoreover, the Smithers have failed to raise any basis for tolling limitations as\nto any other alleged misrepresentation.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      In 2006, John and Patricia Smither executed a home equity loan (the\nLoan), which was secured by their homestead in Houston, Texas (the\nProperty). 1 The Smithers divorced in 2007, and John transferred his interest\nin the Property to Patricia, retaining a lien on the Property pursuant to the\ndivorce decree. In July 2009, Bank of America, the then mortgagee, sent\nnotices of acceleration to the Smithers (the 2009 Acceleration) and, in August\n2009, applied in state district court for an order allowing it to proceed with\nforeclosure (the 2009 Foreclosure Suit). Patricia filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy\npetition in September 2009, and Bank of America dismissed the 2009\nForeclosure Suit without prejudice in December 2009. Patricia\u2019s bankruptcy\npetition was dismissed in January 2010, but she refiled for bankruptcy shortly\nthereafter.    On July 20, 2010, the bankruptcy court confirmed Patricia\u2019s\nbankruptcy plan, which provided for Patricia\u2019s surrender of the Property to\nDitech Financial, L.L.C., the then-and-current mortgagee. However, in June\n2011, Patricia\u2019s bankruptcy plan was amended to allow her to resume payment\non the Loan. Patricia did not, however, resume payment, and on November 6,\n2015, following the discharge of Patricia\u2019s other debts in her bankruptcy case,\nDitech filed a new application for foreclosure in state district court (the 2015\nForeclosure Suit).\n      On November 20, 2015, the Smithers filed the instant suit against Ditech\nin state district court. The Smithers requested a declaration that Ditech\u2019s \u201clien\n\n\n      1 This factual background is drawn from the allegations in the Smithers\u2019 pleadings,\nwhich the court must accept as true in considering whether dismissal was appropriate. See\nSullo & Bobbitt, P.L.L.C. v. Milner, 765 F.3d 388, 391 (5th Cir. 2014).\n                                           2\n\f     Case: 16-20392        Document: 00513906716           Page: 3     Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 16-20392\non the Property [wa]s no longer enforceable.\u201d According to the Smithers, Texas\nCivil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 13.605 required Ditech to bring suit\nforeclosing on its lien on the Property within four years of the 2009\nAcceleration, when Ditech\u2019s cause of action allegedly accrued. 2 Because the\n2015 Foreclosure Suit was brought more than four years later, the Smithers\nasserted that it was \u201cbarred by the statute of limitations.\u201d The Smithers also\nasserted that Ditech had violated the Texas Debt Collection Act (TDCA) by\n\u201creport[ing] the past-due amounts on the Loan on the [Smithers\u2019] credit reports\neven though the debt is no longer enforceable.\u201d\n       On December 28, 2015, Ditech filed a general denial in state district\ncourt. After timely removing the lawsuit to federal district court on the basis\nof diversity jurisdiction, Ditech moved for dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(b)(6). In pertinent part, Ditech argued that Bank of America\u2019s\nvoluntary dismissal of the 2009 Foreclosure Suit constituted abandonment of\nthe 2009 Acceleration, thereby restoring the Loan\u2019s maturity date to its\noriginal condition and rendering the 2015 Foreclosure Suit timely. Ditech also\nargued that the Smithers\u2019 TDCA claim failed because, inter alia, it was based\non the Smithers\u2019 mistaken belief that their debt was no longer enforceable.\n       On February 3, 2016, the Smithers filed a response to Ditech\u2019s motion,\nas well as an amended complaint. 3                  The amended complaint contained\n\n\n       2 \u00a7 16.035 states, in part, that \u201c[a] person must bring suit for the recovery of real\nproperty under a real property lien or the foreclosure of a real property lien not later than\nfour years after the day the cause of action accrues.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 16.035(a).\n       3 The parties dispute whether the Smithers\u2019 amended complaint was timely filed\n\nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(B), such that it, rather than the Smithers\u2019\noriginal petition, should be considered in analyzing whether the Smithers stated claims upon\nwhich relief could be granted. Rule 15(a)(1)(B) allows a party to amend its pleadings \u201conce\nas a matter of course within . . . 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after\nservice of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.\u201d The Smithers assert\nthat their amended complaint was timely because it was filed within 21 days of Ditech\u2019s\nmotion to dismiss. Ditech counters that the amended complaint was untimely because it was\nfiled more than 21 days after Ditech filed its general denial in state court.

First,\nit added an alternative claim under the TDCA, alleging that, even if Bank of\nAmerica abandoned the 2009 Acceleration, Ditech \u201cmisrepresented the\ncharacter, extent, or amount of a consumer debt in violation of Tex. Fin. Code\n\u00a7 392.304(a)(8)\u201d by not reflecting that abandonment \u201con information provided\nto credit reporting agencies.\u201d Second, it added a claim that Ditech violated the\nFair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) by \u201ccontinuing to report the past-\ndue amounts on the Loan and the foreclosure of the Loan on the [Smithers\u2019]\ncredit reports even though either the debt is no longer enforceable or the\nforeclosure was abandoned.\u201d\n       On April 15, 2016, the district court granted Ditech\u2019s motion to dismiss\nand dismissed the entire case with prejudice. The Smithers timely moved for\nreconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), 4 arguing that the\ndistrict court erred in dismissing their entire case with prejudice because their\namended complaint asserted additional facts and additional causes of actions\nthat were not addressed in Ditech\u2019s motion to dismiss. In response, Ditech\nargued that the Smithers\u2019 amended complaint, like their original petition,\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court\ndenied the Smithers\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion on May 27, and the Smithers timely\nappealed, challenging the \u201cfinal order (judgment) of the District Court for\nSouthern District of Texas, Houston Division, entered in this action on . . . May\n27, 2016, at docket number 18.\u201d\n\n\n\ndo not, resolve this dispute because, as discussed infra, the Smithers\u2019 amended complaint\nand original petition both fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n       4 Although styled as a motion for new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n59(a), we construe the Smithers\u2019 motion as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under\nRule 59(e) because there was no trial. See Calhoun v. FBI, 546 F. App\u2019x 487, 489 n.2 (5th\nCir. 2013) (per curiam); Patin v. Allied Signal, Inc., 77 F.3d 782, 785, n.1 (5th Cir. 1996).\nIndeed, on appeal, both parties analyze the Smithers\u2019 motion as a Rule 59(e) motion to\nreconsider the district court\u2019s dismissal order.\n                                              4\n\f     Case: 16-20392       Document: 00513906716         Page: 5    Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-20392\n                                 II. JURISDICTION\n       Before proceeding to the merits, we must address Ditech\u2019s apparent\nargument that we lack jurisdiction to consider the Smithers\u2019 challenge to the\nunderlying dismissal because they did not explicitly identify the district court\u2019s\ndismissal order in their notice of appeal. 5 Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\n3(c)(1)(B) provides that \u201c[t]he notice of appeal must . . . designate the judgment,\norder, or part thereof being appealed.\u201d \u201cRule 3\u2019s dictates are jurisdictional in\nnature,\u201d Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 147 (2012) (quoting Smith v. Barry,\n502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992)), but \u201ca mere technical error in designating the proper\njudgment being appealed will not divest us of jurisdiction,\u201d Lockett v. Anderson,\n230 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir. 2000). We \u201cconstrue a notice of appeal liberally to\navoid technical barriers to review\u201d; thus, \u201c[a] mistake in designating orders to\nbe appealed does not bar review [(1)] if the intent to appeal a particular\njudgment can be fairly inferred and [(2)] if the appellee is not prejudiced or\nmisled by the mistake.\u201d N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Deshotel, 142 F.3d 873, 884 (5th\nCir. 1998).      When a party appeals only the denial of a motion for\nreconsideration under Rule 59(e), \u201cwe can infer that the party meant to appeal\nthe adverse underlying judgment.\u201d Lockett, 230 F.3d at 700; see also, e.g., R.P.\nex rel. R.P. v. Alamo Heights Indep. Sch. Dist., 703 F.3d 801, 808 (5th Cir. 2012)\n(\u201cWe have specifically treated appeals of 59(e) motions for reconsideration as\nappeals of the underlying judgment when the intent to do so was clear.\u201d\n(alterations omitted) (quoting Alberta Energy Partners v. Blast Energy Servs.,\nInc., 593 F.3d 418, 424 n.3 (5th Cir. 2010))). \u201c[I]n determining the fairly\ninferred scope of the appeal,\u201d we \u201cconsider not only the notice, but also the\n\n\n\n       5In its cursory treatment of this issue, Ditech asserts that we are not required to\nconsider the underlying dismissal, but does not specifically assert that we lack jurisdiction\nover that order. Nonetheless, the Smithers interpret and brief Ditech\u2019s argument as a\nchallenge to our jurisdiction.\n                                             5\n\f      Case: 16-20392   Document: 00513906716     Page: 6   Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-20392\nappellant\u2019s brief.\u201d Williams v. Henagan, 595 F.3d 610, 616 (5th Cir. 2010) (per\ncuriam).\n       Here, the Smithers\u2019 notice of appeal only designated the district court\u2019s\nMay 27, 2016, order denying their Rule 59(e) motion. Nonetheless, we can\ninfer from their appeal of the denial of the Rule 59(e) motion, together with the\nfact that the Smithers (and Ditech) fully briefed on appeal the issues raised by\nthe underlying dismissal, that the Smithers clearly intended to also appeal this\ndismissal. See, e.g., R.P., 703 F.3d at 808; Lockett, 230 F.3d at 700. Because\nDitech has not asserted it was prejudiced by the omission of the dismissal from\nthe notice of appeal, we have jurisdiction to review the underlying dismissal\norder. See, e.g., Alberta Energy Partners, 593 F.3d at 424 n.3; Lockett, 230 F.3d\nat 700.\n                       III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n        \u201cWe generally review a decision on a motion to alter or amend judgment\nunder Rule 59(e) for abuse of discretion.\u201d Pioneer Nat. Res. USA, Inc. v. Paper,\nAllied Indus., Chem. & Energy Workers Int\u2019l Union Loc. 4\u2013487, 328 F.3d 818,\n820 (5th Cir. 2003). However, the standard of review is de novo where the\nruling seeks reconsideration of a question of law. Id. We likewise review a\ndistrict court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting all well-pleaded\nfacts as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Sullo\n& Bobbitt, 765 F.3d at 391.\n       \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on\nits face.\u2019\u201d Aschroft v.

(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).\n                     IV. FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM\n      The Smithers contend that the district court erred in dismissing their\ncase and denying their motion for reconsideration because they stated a\nplausible claim (1) for a declaration that Ditech\u2019s right to foreclosure was time-\nbarred by Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code \u00a7 13.605\u2019s four-year statute\nof limitations for foreclosure actions; (2) that Ditech violated the TDCA; and\n(3) that Ditech violated that FDCPA. We begin our analysis with the Smithers\u2019\nclaim that Ditech is time-barred from foreclosing on its lien on the Property.\nA. Claim for Declaratory Relief\n      Under Texas law, \u201c[a] person must bring suit for the recovery of real\nproperty under a real property lien or the foreclosure of a real property lien not\nlater than four years after the day the cause of action accrues.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac.\n& Rem. Code \u00a7 16.035(a). \u201cOn the expiration of the four-year limitations\nperiod, the real property lien . . . become[s] void.\u201d Id. \u00a7 16.035(d). Where, as\nhere, the note secured by the real property lien is payable in installments, \u201cthe\nfour-year limitations period does not begin to run until the maturity date of\nthe last . . . installment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 16.035(e). However, if the note contains an\noption to accelerate payment upon default, \u201cthe action accrues . . . when the\nholder actually exercises its option to accelerate.\u201d Holy Cross Church of God\nin Christ v. Wolf, 44 S.W.3d 562, 566 (Tex. 2001).\n      To effectively accelerate payment of a note, the noteholder must provide\n\u201c(1) notice of intent to accelerate and (2) notice of acceleration.\u201d Id.; see also\nBoren v. U.S. Nat. Bank Ass\u2019n, 807 F.3d 99, 104 (5th Cir. 2015). The notice of\nintent to accelerate \u201cmust afford an opportunity to cure the default\u201d and\nprovide notice \u201cthat failure to cure will result in acceleration of the note and\nforeclosure.\u201d Ogden v. Gibraltar Sav. Ass\u2019n, 640 S.W.2d 232, 233 (Tex. 1982).\n                                        7\n\f    Case: 16-20392     Document: 00513906716      Page: 8   Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-20392\nOnce the requisite notice of intent is provided, notice of acceleration may take\nthe form of the filing of a foreclosure action. See Burney v. Citigroup Glob.\nMkts. Realty Corp., 244 S.W.3d 900, 903\u201304 (Tex. App.\u2014Dallas 2008, no pet.).\nNotice of acceleration \u201ccuts off the debtor\u2019s right to cure his default and gives\nnotice that the entire debt is due and payable.\u201d Ogden, 640 S.W.2d at 234.\nHowever, once the noteholder has accelerated payment of the note, the holder\nmay abandon that acceleration, which \u201c\u2018has the effect of restoring the contract\nto its original condition,\u2019 [and] thereby \u2018restoring the note\u2019s original maturity\ndate\u2019 for purposes of accrual.\u201d Boren, 807 F.3d at 104 (quoting Khan v. GBAK\nProps., Inc., 371 S.W.3d 347, 353 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, no\npet.)); see also Holy Cross Church of God in Christ, 44 S.W.3d at 566\u201367.\n      In determining whether a noteholder has abandoned acceleration, Texas\ncourts have referenced traditional principles of waiver. Boren, 807 F.3d at 105.\n\u201cUnder Texas law, the elements of waiver include: (1) an existing right, benefit,\nor advantage held by a party; (2) the party\u2019s actual knowledge of its existence;\nand (3) the party\u2019s actual intent to relinquish the right, or intentional conduct\ninconsistent with the right.\u201d Id. (quoting Thompson v. Bank of Am. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n,\n783 F.3d 1022, 1025 (5th Cir. 2015)). One way in which Texas courts have\nrecognized that a noteholder may evince its intent to waive a prior acceleration\nis by voluntarily nonsuiting an action to collect on the note or to foreclose on\nthe lien securing the note. See Denbina v. City of Hurst, 516 S.W.2d 460, 463\n(Tex. Civ. App.\u2014Tyler 1974, no writ) (\u201c[T]he City had a right to withdraw or\nrevoke its option to accelerate payment, and effectively expressed its intent to\ndo so by taking a non-suit.\u201d); see also, e.g., Costello v.

App\u2019x 414 (5th Cir. 2016) (per curiam).\n       In both their original petition and amended complaint, the Smithers\nalleged that Bank of America voluntarily dismissed the 2009 Foreclosure Suit.\nThey concede that, at the motion to dismiss stage, we must accept this fact as\ntrue, but argue that the facts alleged nonetheless do not support the reasonable\ninference that Bank of America waived the 2009 Acceleration because there is\n\u201cnothing in the [pleadings] to indicate that [Ditech] sent a second set of\nacceleration notices to the[m].\u201d 6 In support, the Smithers point to Callan v.\nDeutsche Bank Tr. Co. Ams. (Callan I), 11 F. Supp. 3d 761 (S.D. Tex. 2014).\nThere, the district court held that Deutsche Bank had not abandoned\nacceleration of a note when it dismissed a 2008 foreclosure action because\nDeutsche Bank \u201crelied on the same November 6, 2007 notice of acceleration in\nfiling its second foreclosure proceeding in February 2009.\u201d                   Id. at 769.\nAccording to the district court, Deutsche Bank\u2019s reliance on the prior notice of\nacceleration \u201cma[d]e clear that Deutsche did not abandon the acceleration by\ndismissing the 2008 action.\u201d Id. The district court further held that Deutsche\nBank\u2019s subsequent rescission of the November 6, 2007 notice of acceleration\n\n\n\n       6  The Smithers also argue that Bank of America and Ditech made statements\ninconsistent with abandonment of the 2009 Acceleration\u2014namely, that Bank of America and\nDitech reported to credit agencies \u201cthat the Property was in the process of foreclosure or in\nforeclosure\u201d following the voluntary dismissal of the 2009 Foreclosure Suit. According to the\nSmithers\u2019 own argument, however, these statements would be consistent with abandonment\nif Bank of America and Ditech did, in fact, provide separate acceleration notices. Thus, the\nSmithers\u2019 argument about the statements is, at base, the same as their argument about\nDitech\u2019s failure to provide a second set of acceleration notices.\n                                             9\n\f    Case: 16-20392      Document: 00513906716         Page: 10    Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 16-20392\nwas ineffective due to the borrower\u2019s detrimental reliance on the acceleration\nand, therefore, concluded that Deutsche Bank\u2019s third foreclosure action, filed\nin 2012, was time-barred. Id. at 772.\n      The Smithers\u2019 \u201creliance on . . . Callan [I] is misplaced.\u201d Leonard v. Ocwen\nLoan Servicing, L.L.C., 616 F. App\u2019x 677, 680 (5th Cir. 2015) (per curiam).\n\u201c[T]he district court [in Callan] later amended its judgment and held that,\ncontrary to its earlier opinion, \u2018Deutsche was entitled to rescind, and its\n[foreclosure application] . . . was not time-barred.\u2019\u201d Id. (omission and third\nalteration in original) (quoting Callan v. Deutsche Bank Tr. Co. Ams. (Callan\nII), 93 F. Supp. 3d 725, 737 (S.D. Tex. 2015)). Significantly, the district court\u2019s\nopinion in Callan II omitted the holding in Callan I that Deutsche Bank did\nnot abandon acceleration of the note when it dismissed the 2008 foreclosure\naction\u2014the holding upon which the Smithers almost entirely rest their case.\nCallan II, 93 F. Supp. 3d at 737\u201338.\n      But even if the Smithers\u2019 reliance on Callan I were not misplaced, the\nSmithers\u2019 position still must be rejected. The Smithers did not allege in either\ntheir original petition or their amended complaint that Ditech did not, in fact,\nprovide them a second set of acceleration notices in connection with the 2015\nForeclosure Suit. Instead, they argue that the absence of an allegation as to\nseparate acceleration notices supports the reasonable inference that no\nseparate acceleration notices were provided and, therefore, that the 2009\nAcceleration was not abandoned. We disagree. The original petition and\namended complaint are devoid of any factual allegations that would support a\nreasonable inference that Ditech did not send separate acceleration notices, 7\n\n\n\n      7 In fact, Ditech has provided the court with separate acceleration notices that were\napparently provided to the Smithers in connection the 2015 Foreclosure Suit and asked that\nwe take judicial notice of them. Because the Smithers\u2019 claim fails regardless of whether we\naccept or reject Ditech\u2019s request to take judicial notice, we need not, and do not, address\n                                            10\n\f    Case: 16-20392       Document: 00513906716         Page: 11     Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-20392\nmuch less support the inference that Bank of America did not abandon the\n2009 Acceleration.       Indeed, the credit reporting activity about which the\nSmithers also complain suggests that the 2009 Acceleration was, in fact,\nabandoned. For instance, in 2013, the Loan was reported as closed with a\ndelinquency of $13,101\u2014far less than the Loan\u2019s accelerated balance of\n$406,323.83. 8 Accordingly, the Smithers failed to state a plausible claim for\ndeclaratory relief.\nB. TDCA Claim\n       In their amended complaint, the Smithers asserted, in relevant part,\nthat Ditech \u201cmisrepresented the character, extent, or amount of a consumer\ndebt in violation of Tex. Fin. Code \u00a7 392.304(a)(8)\u201d by not reflecting the\nabandonment of the 2009 Acceleration \u201con information provided to credit\nreporting agencies.\u201d 9 To state a claim under \u00a7 392.304(a)(8), a plaintiff must\nplausibly allege a misrepresentation led him or her to be unaware (1) that he\nor she had a mortgage debt, (2) of the specific amount owed, or (3) that he or\nshe had defaulted. See Rucker v. Bank of Am., N.A., 806 F.3d 828, 832 (5th\n\n\n\nwhether it would be appropriate for us to take judicial notice of the separate acceleration\nnotices.\n        8 Contrary to the Smithers\u2019 position, the reports by Bank of America and Ditech \u201cthat\n\nthe Property was in the process of foreclosure or in foreclosure\u201d following the voluntary\ndismissal of the 2009 Foreclosure Suit do not support the inference that Bank of America did\nnot abandon the 2009 Acceleration. As an initial matter, the Smithers\u2019 position assumes that\nBank of America and Ditech could not subsequently foreclose on the Property to recover on\nonly the unaccelerated, delinquent balance of the Loan. The Smithers, however, have cited\nabsolutely no factual or legal basis for that assumption. Moreover, even if re-acceleration\nwere a prerequisite to a subsequent foreclosure, as the Smithers assume, the pleadings are\ndevoid of any factual allegation that would support the inference that Bank of America and\nDitech did not provide, or would not have provided, separate notices of acceleration, which\nthe Smithers concede would confirm abandonment.\n        9 The Smithers concede that the other TDCA claim asserted in their original petition\n\nand amended complaint\u2014that Ditech violated the TDCA by continuing to report on the\nSmithers\u2019 credit reports past-due amounts on the Loan, even though that debt was no longer\nenforceable\u2014fails in light of our holding that they have not stated a claim for declaratory\nrelief. Accordingly, we do not separately address that claim.\n                                             11\n\f   Case: 16-20392     Document: 00513906716     Page: 12   Date Filed: 03/10/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-20392\nCir. 2015); Miller v.

The Smithers\u2019 amended complaint fails to make\nany such allegation. Accordingly, the Smithers failed to state a plausible claim\nthat Ditech violated the TDCA.\nC. FDCPA Claim\n      The Smithers asserted in their amended complaint that Ditech violated\nthe FDCPA \u201c[b]y continuing to report the past-due amounts on the Loan and\nthe foreclosure of the Loan on the [Smithers\u2019] credit reports even though either\nthe debt is no longer enforceable or the foreclosure was abandoned.\u201d The\nFDCPA prohibits \u201cfalse, deceptive, or misleading representation[s] or means\nin connection with the collection of any debt.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e. A claim under\nthe FDCPA must be brought within one year from the date the violation occurs.\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(d). Here, the only credit reporting activity that is alleged to\nhave occurred within the one-year limitations period is a report by Greentree\nFinancial Services that foreclosure proceedings were initiated in 2015. The\nSmithers have failed to show how Greentree Financial Services is related to\nDitech or how that specific report was false, deceptive, or otherwise misleading.\nMoreover, the Smithers have failed to raise any basis for tolling limitations as\nto any other alleged misrepresentation. Accordingly, the Smithers failed to\nstate a plausible claim that Ditech violated the FDCPA.\n                              V. CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       12\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "3b3cd4a0327288546f68188662f1efdeafca0341", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/14852/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/22191/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/70823/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/112673/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145730/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/145875/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/714029/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1772082/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1947742/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2418868/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2459444/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2017-03-11T01:00:53.993148Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 12, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/4374681/john-smither-v-ditech-financial-llc/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "4151934", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "John Smither v.
