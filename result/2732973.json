Appellant was paroled May 1, 2008,\n\nand was ordered to report to a halfway house at Crossroads. Appellant failed to report\n\nto either his parole officer or the halfway house.\n\n          {\u00b64}   On February 9, 2009, the Richland County Grand Jury indicted appellant,\n\nWilliam E. Smith, on one count of escape in violation of R.C. \u00a72921.34(A)(1), a felony of\n\nthe second degree.\n\n          {\u00b65}   On October 3, 2013, Appellant was arraigned and entered a plea of not\n\nguilty.\n\n          {\u00b66}   On February 3, 2014, Appellant changed his plea to no contest, which was\n\naccepted by the trial court.\n\n          {\u00b67}   The trial court found Appellant guilty and sentenced Appellant to two years\n\nincarceration concurrent to the remainder of the sentence he was previously serving on\n\nthe underlying case.\n\n          {\u00b68}   Appellant filed an appeal, and this matter is now before this Court for\n\nconsideration. The sole Assignment of Error is:\n\n          {\u00b69}   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT DISMISSING THE INDICTMENT\n\nFOR       APPELLEE'S       FAILURE     TO    PROVIDE      TERRITORIAL       JURISDICTION\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                         3\n\n\nINFORMATION TO ESTABLISH SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION IN THE TRIAL\n\nCOURT.\"\n\n                                             I.\n\n       {\u00b610} Appellant claims the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that\n\nthe indictment should be dismissed because it failed to allege the state in which the\n\nevents resulting in the criminal charges occurred, and further claims that the trial court\n\nshould not have accepted his no contest plea. We disagree.\n\n                                            Indictment\n\n       {\u00b611} Crim.R. 7(B) sets forth the nature and contents of an indictment and states\n\nit shall \"contain a statement that the defendant has committed a public offense specified\n\nin the indictment. *** The statement may be made in ordinary and concise language\n\nwithout technical averments or allegations not essential to be proved.\"\n\n       {\u00b612} R.C. \u00a72901.11 governs criminal law jurisdiction. Subsection (A)(1) states:\n\n       {\u00b613} \"A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this state if\n\nany of the following occur: *** The person commits an offense under the laws of this\n\nstate, any element of which takes place in this state.\"\n\n       {\u00b614} Subsection (D) states the following:\n\n       {\u00b615} \u201cWhen an offense is committed under the laws of this state, and it appears\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the offense took place\n\neither in this state or in another jurisdiction or jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be\n\ndetermined in which it took place, the offense or element is conclusively presumed to\n\nhave taken place in this state for purposes of this section.\u201d\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                      4\n\n\n      {\u00b616} The single count contained in the indictment alleged the jurisdiction to be\n\n\"at the County of Richland\" and was prefaced by the following:\n\n                            INDICTMENT FOR: ESCAPE\n                    THE STATE OF OHIO, RICHLAND COUNTY, SS.\n                           COURT OF COMMON PLEAS.\u201d\n\n             Of the term of January in the Year of our Lord two thousand nine.\n\n             The jurors of the grand jury of the State of Ohio, within and for the\n\n             body of the County aforesaid, on their oaths, in the name and by\n\n             the authority of the State of Ohio, do find and present that:\n\n      {\u00b617} We find this language is sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the state\n\nof Ohio, Richland County. State v. Hamilton, 5th Dist Richland No. 13CA93, 2014-Ohio-\n\n3171. As explained by the Tenth District in State v. Williams, 53 Ohio App.3d 1, *4\n\n(10th Dist.1988):\n\n      {\u00b618} \u201cHowever, R.C. 2901.11(D) provides that, when an offense is committed\n\nunder the laws of this state and it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense\n\nor any element took place either in Ohio or in another jurisdiction and it cannot\n\nreasonably be determined in which it took place, such offense or element is conclusively\n\npresumed to have taken place in this state for purposes of this section.\n\n      {\u00b619} \u201cAppellees are accused of committing offenses under the laws of this\n\nstate, i.e., R.C. 2913.02(A)(3), which is theft by deception, and also R.C. 2913.31(A)(3),\n\nwhich is uttering or possessing with purpose to utter any writing which he knows to have\n\nbeen forged. Assuming, arguendo, that we do not know in which state these offenses\n\nwere performed under R.C. 2901.11(D), Ohio still claims subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nthe offenses.\u201d\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                      5\n\n\n       {\u00b620} Upon review, we find the indictment was not defective.\n\n                                        No Contest Plea\n\n       {\u00b621} Appellant argues that at the change of plea hearing, the trial court erred in\n\naddressing him as if he were entering a plea of \u201cguilty\u201d rather than a plea of \u201cno\n\ncontest.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b622} Pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C):\n\n       {\u00b623} \u201c(2) In felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a\n\nplea of no contest, and shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first\n\naddressing the defendant personally and doing all of the following:\n\n       {\u00b624} \u201c ***\n\n       {\u00b625} \u201c(b) Informing the defendant of and determining that the defendant\n\nunderstands the effect of the plea of guilty or no contest, and that the court, upon\n\nacceptance of the plea, may proceed with judgment and sentence.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b626} Because the rights contained in Crim.R. 11(B) and 11(E) are\n\nnonconstitutional, appellant must show that he suffered some prejudice from the court's\n\nerror. State v. Jones, 116 Ohio St.3d 211, 877 N.E.2d 677, 2007 Ohio 6093. The test\n\nfor prejudice is \u201cwhether the plea would have otherwise been made.\u201d State v. Griggs,\n\n103 Ohio St.3d 85, 2004\u2013Ohio\u20134415, 814 N.E.2d 51, \u00b6 12, citing State v. Nero, 56 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 106, 107, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990). A defendant who has entered a guilty or no\n\ncontest plea without asserting actual innocence is presumed to understand the effect of\n\nthe plea, and the court's failure to inform the defendant of the effect of the plea as\n\nrequired by Crim.R. 11 is presumed not to be prejudicial. See Griggs at syllabus.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                             6\n\n\n       {\u00b627} Upon review, while it does appear that during part of the plea colloquy, the\n\ntrial court did refer to the plea as a \u201cGuilty\u201d plea, at the end of the colloquy, the trial court\n\ncorrected itself and properly outlined the effects of a \u201cNo Contest\u201d plea to Appellant.\n\n       {\u00b628} The trial court stated:\n\n       {\u00b629} \u201cIn any event, I am willing to accept a no contest plea. Bly pleading no\n\ncontest you are saying I don\u2019t contest the allegations that are made against me, I\n\ncontest their legal value, but I don\u2019t contest the allegations.\n\n       {\u00b630} ***\n\n       {\u00b631} \u201cBecause I believe those allegations constitute a crime of escape I\u2019m\n\ngoing to find you guilty on your no contest plea, do you understand?\u201d (T. at 11).\n\n       {\u00b632} Additionally, Appellant executed a plea form which outlined the effect of a\n\n\u201cNo Contest\u201d plea.\n\n       {\u00b633} Here, Appellant has not argued that he was prejudiced by the trial court's\n\nerror. Moreover, there is no evidence of prejudice apparent on the record. Appellant,\n\nwho was represented by counsel, never asserted his innocence in this matter. At the\n\nplea hearing, Appellant admitted that he wanted to change his plea to one of                  no\n\ncontest. Therefore, under the totality of the circumstances, we find no prejudice\n\nresulting from the court's error.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                               7\n\n\n      {\u00b634} Appellant\u2019s sole Assignment of Error is denied.\n\n      {\u00b635} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of\n\nRichland County, Ohio is hereby affirmed.\n\n\nBy: Wise, J.\n\nHoffman, P.

Appellant was paroled May 1, 2008,\n\nand was ordered to report to a halfway house at Crossroads. Appellant failed to report\n\nto either his parole officer or the halfway house.\n\n          {\u00b64}   On February 9, 2009, the Richland County Grand Jury indicted appellant,\n\nWilliam E. Smith, on one count of escape in violation of R.C. \u00a72921.34(A)(1), a felony of\n\nthe second degree.\n\n          {\u00b65}   On October 3, 2013, Appellant was arraigned and entered a plea of not\n\nguilty.\n\n          {\u00b66}   On February 3, 2014, Appellant changed his plea to no contest, which was\n\naccepted by the trial court.\n\n          {\u00b67}   The trial court found Appellant guilty and sentenced Appellant to two years\n\nincarceration concurrent to the remainder of the sentence he was previously serving on\n\nthe underlying case.\n\n          {\u00b68}   Appellant filed an appeal, and this matter is now before this Court for\n\nconsideration. The sole Assignment of Error is:\n\n          {\u00b69}   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT DISMISSING THE INDICTMENT\n\nFOR       APPELLEE'S       FAILURE     TO    PROVIDE      TERRITORIAL       JURISDICTION\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                         3\n\n\nINFORMATION TO ESTABLISH SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION IN THE TRIAL\n\nCOURT.\"\n\n                                             I.\n\n       {\u00b610} Appellant claims the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that\n\nthe indictment should be dismissed because it failed to allege the state in which the\n\nevents resulting in the criminal charges occurred, and further claims that the trial court\n\nshould not have accepted his no contest plea. We disagree.\n\n                                            Indictment\n\n       {\u00b611} Crim.R. 7(B) sets forth the nature and contents of an indictment and states\n\nit shall \"contain a statement that the defendant has committed a public offense specified\n\nin the indictment. *** The statement may be made in ordinary and concise language\n\nwithout technical averments or allegations not essential to be proved.\"\n\n       {\u00b612} R.C. \u00a72901.11 governs criminal law jurisdiction. Subsection (A)(1) states:\n\n       {\u00b613} \"A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this state if\n\nany of the following occur: *** The person commits an offense under the laws of this\n\nstate, any element of which takes place in this state.\"\n\n       {\u00b614} Subsection (D) states the following:\n\n       {\u00b615} \u201cWhen an offense is committed under the laws of this state, and it appears\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the offense took place\n\neither in this state or in another jurisdiction or jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be\n\ndetermined in which it took place, the offense or element is conclusively presumed to\n\nhave taken place in this state for purposes of this section.\u201d\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                      4\n\n\n      {\u00b616} The single count contained in the indictment alleged the jurisdiction to be\n\n\"at the County of Richland\" and was prefaced by the following:\n\n                            INDICTMENT FOR: ESCAPE\n                    THE STATE OF OHIO, RICHLAND COUNTY, SS.\n                           COURT OF COMMON PLEAS.\u201d\n\n             Of the term of January in the Year of our Lord two thousand nine.\n\n             The jurors of the grand jury of the State of Ohio, within and for the\n\n             body of the County aforesaid, on their oaths, in the name and by\n\n             the authority of the State of Ohio, do find and present that:\n\n      {\u00b617} We find this language is sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the state\n\nof Ohio, Richland County.

Assuming, arguendo, that we do not know in which state these offenses\n\nwere performed under R.C. 2901.11(D), Ohio still claims subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nthe offenses.\u201d\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                      5\n\n\n       {\u00b620} Upon review, we find the indictment was not defective.\n\n                                        No Contest Plea\n\n       {\u00b621} Appellant argues that at the change of plea hearing, the trial court erred in\n\naddressing him as if he were entering a plea of \u201cguilty\u201d rather than a plea of \u201cno\n\ncontest.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b622} Pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C):\n\n       {\u00b623} \u201c(2) In felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a\n\nplea of no contest, and shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first\n\naddressing the defendant personally and doing all of the following:\n\n       {\u00b624} \u201c ***\n\n       {\u00b625} \u201c(b) Informing the defendant of and determining that the defendant\n\nunderstands the effect of the plea of guilty or no contest, and that the court, upon\n\nacceptance of the plea, may proceed with judgment and sentence.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b626} Because the rights contained in Crim.R. 11(B) and 11(E) are\n\nnonconstitutional, appellant must show that he suffered some prejudice from the court's\n\nerror.

A defendant who has entered a guilty or no\n\ncontest plea without asserting actual innocence is presumed to understand the effect of\n\nthe plea, and the court's failure to inform the defendant of the effect of the plea as\n\nrequired by Crim.R. 11 is presumed not to be prejudicial. See Griggs at syllabus.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                             6\n\n\n       {\u00b627} Upon review, while it does appear that during part of the plea colloquy, the\n\ntrial court did refer to the plea as a \u201cGuilty\u201d plea, at the end of the colloquy, the trial court\n\ncorrected itself and properly outlined the effects of a \u201cNo Contest\u201d plea to Appellant.\n\n       {\u00b628} The trial court stated:\n\n       {\u00b629} \u201cIn any event, I am willing to accept a no contest plea. Bly pleading no\n\ncontest you are saying I don\u2019t contest the allegations that are made against me, I\n\ncontest their legal value, but I don\u2019t contest the allegations.\n\n       {\u00b630} ***\n\n       {\u00b631} \u201cBecause I believe those allegations constitute a crime of escape I\u2019m\n\ngoing to find you guilty on your no contest plea, do you understand?\u201d (T. at 11).\n\n       {\u00b632} Additionally, Appellant executed a plea form which outlined the effect of a\n\n\u201cNo Contest\u201d plea.\n\n       {\u00b633} Here, Appellant has not argued that he was prejudiced by the trial court's\n\nerror. Moreover, there is no evidence of prejudice apparent on the record. Appellant,\n\nwho was represented by counsel, never asserted his innocence in this matter. At the\n\nplea hearing, Appellant admitted that he wanted to change his plea to one of                  no\n\ncontest. Therefore, under the totality of the circumstances, we find no prejudice\n\nresulting from the court's error.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                               7\n\n\n      {\u00b634} Appellant\u2019s sole Assignment of Error is denied.\n\n      {\u00b635} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of\n\nRichland County, Ohio is hereby affirmed.\n\n\nBy: Wise, J.\n\nHoffman, P.
