A defendant who has entered a guilty or no\n\ncontest plea without asserting actual innocence is presumed to understand the effect of\n\nthe plea, and the court's failure to inform the defendant of the effect of the plea as\n\nrequired by Crim.R. 11 is presumed not to be prejudicial. See Griggs at syllabus.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                             6\n\n\n       {\u00b627} Upon review, while it does appear that during part of the plea colloquy, the\n\ntrial court did refer to the plea as a \u201cGuilty\u201d plea, at the end of the colloquy, the trial court\n\ncorrected itself and properly outlined the effects of a \u201cNo Contest\u201d plea to Appellant.\n\n       {\u00b628} The trial court stated:\n\n       {\u00b629} \u201cIn any event, I am willing to accept a no contest plea.

Moreover, there is no evidence of prejudice apparent on the record. Appellant,\n\nwho was represented by counsel, never asserted his innocence in this matter. At the\n\nplea hearing, Appellant admitted that he wanted to change his plea to one of                  no\n\ncontest. Therefore, under the totality of the circumstances, we find no prejudice\n\nresulting from the court's error.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                               7\n\n\n      {\u00b634} Appellant\u2019s sole Assignment of Error is denied.\n\n      {\u00b635} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of\n\nRichland County, Ohio is hereby affirmed.\n\n\nBy: Wise, J.\n\nHoffman, P.

State v. Hamilton, 5th Dist Richland No. 13CA93, 2014-Ohio-\n\n3171. As explained by the Tenth District in State v. Williams, 53 Ohio App.3d 1, *4\n\n(10th Dist.1988):\n\n      {\u00b618} \u201cHowever, R.C. 2901.11(D) provides that, when an offense is committed\n\nunder the laws of this state and it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense\n\nor any element took place either in Ohio or in another jurisdiction and it cannot\n\nreasonably be determined in which it took place, such offense or element is conclusively\n\npresumed to have taken place in this state for purposes of this section.\n\n      {\u00b619} \u201cAppellees are accused of committing offenses under the laws of this\n\nstate, i.e., R.C. 2913.02(A)(3), which is theft by deception, and also R.C. 2913.31(A)(3),\n\nwhich is uttering or possessing with purpose to utter any writing which he knows to have\n\nbeen forged. Assuming, arguendo, that we do not know in which state these offenses\n\nwere performed under R.C. 2901.11(D), Ohio still claims subject matter jurisdiction over\n\nthe offenses.\u201d\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                      5\n\n\n       {\u00b620} Upon review, we find the indictment was not defective.\n\n                                        No Contest Plea\n\n       {\u00b621} Appellant argues that at the change of plea hearing, the trial court erred in\n\naddressing him as if he were entering a plea of \u201cguilty\u201d rather than a plea of \u201cno\n\ncontest.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b622} Pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C):\n\n       {\u00b623} \u201c(2) In felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a\n\nplea of no contest, and shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first\n\naddressing the defendant personally and doing all of the following:\n\n       {\u00b624} \u201c ***\n\n       {\u00b625} \u201c(b) Informing the defendant of and determining that the defendant\n\nunderstands the effect of the plea of guilty or no contest, and that the court, upon\n\nacceptance of the plea, may proceed with judgment and sentence.\u201d\n\n       {\u00b626} Because the rights contained in Crim.R. 11(B) and 11(E) are\n\nnonconstitutional, appellant must show that he suffered some prejudice from the court's\n\nerror. State v. Jones, 116 Ohio St.3d 211, 877 N.E.2d 677, 2007 Ohio 6093. The test\n\nfor prejudice is \u201cwhether the plea would have otherwise been made.\u201d State v. Griggs,\n\n103 Ohio St.3d 85, 2004\u2013Ohio\u20134415, 814 N.E.2d 51, \u00b6 12, citing State v. Nero, 56 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 106, 107, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990). A defendant who has entered a guilty or no\n\ncontest plea without asserting actual innocence is presumed to understand the effect of\n\nthe plea, and the court's failure to inform the defendant of the effect of the plea as\n\nrequired by Crim.R. 11 is presumed not to be prejudicial. See Griggs at syllabus.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                                             6\n\n\n       {\u00b627} Upon review, while it does appear that during part of the plea colloquy, the\n\ntrial court did refer to the plea as a \u201cGuilty\u201d plea, at the end of the colloquy, the trial court\n\ncorrected itself and properly outlined the effects of a \u201cNo Contest\u201d plea to Appellant.\n\n       {\u00b628} The trial court stated:\n\n       {\u00b629} \u201cIn any event, I am willing to accept a no contest plea. Bly pleading no\n\ncontest you are saying I don\u2019t contest the allegations that are made against me, I\n\ncontest their legal value, but I don\u2019t contest the allegations.\n\n       {\u00b630} ***\n\n       {\u00b631} \u201cBecause I believe those allegations constitute a crime of escape I\u2019m\n\ngoing to find you guilty on your no contest plea, do you understand?\u201d (T. at 11).\n\n       {\u00b632} Additionally, Appellant executed a plea form which outlined the effect of a\n\n\u201cNo Contest\u201d plea.\n\n       {\u00b633} Here, Appellant has not argued that he was prejudiced by the trial court's\n\nerror. Moreover, there is no evidence of prejudice apparent on the record. Appellant,\n\nwho was represented by counsel, never asserted his innocence in this matter. At the\n\nplea hearing, Appellant admitted that he wanted to change his plea to one of                  no\n\ncontest. Therefore, under the totality of the circumstances, we find no prejudice\n\nresulting from the court's error.\n\fRichland County, Case No. 14 CA 15                                               7\n\n\n      {\u00b634} Appellant\u2019s sole Assignment of Error is denied.\n\n      {\u00b635} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of\n\nRichland County, Ohio is hereby affirmed.\n\n\nBy: Wise, J.\n\nHoffman, P.
