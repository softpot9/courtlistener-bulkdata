It\nruns its Louisiana operations through an affiliate, Servicio Marina Superior,\nL.L.C.   Smith Marine Towing is a Louisiana corporation specializing in\nchartering tugboats.    In 2009, Cashman and Smith collaborated to provide\ntugboat and barge services to Condux, S.A., de C.V., a subsidiary of Groupo\nProtexa S.A., a Mexican oil company. Cashman, which took the lead on the\nproject, was unable to recover payment from Condux. Based on its previous\ndealings with Condux, Cashman believed the surest way to recover payments\nwas to refuse to provide Protexa or its affiliates with future barge services.\nCashman was able to recover some payments using this tactic, but a large sum\nremained outstanding for the work Cashman and Smith had done for Condux.\n      In 2011, Smith approached Cashman about chartering deck barge JMC\n2508 for an unspecified job. Cashman, who was still seeking to recover the\namount owed by Condux, believed the barge would not be used for a job\nassociated with Protexa or its affiliates. Cashman entered into Barge Bareboat\nCharter 2508 with Smith, which contained these terms:\n            The Charter Hire shall be $2,200.00 per day without set off,\n      beginning on October 11, 2011. . . The initial irrevocable term is\n      thirty (30) days. Thereafter, while the [JMC 2508] remains in the\n      possession of the CHARTERER, this agreement shall continue\n      until possession of the Vessel is tendered by CHARTERER and\n      accepted by OWNER. . . Upon expiration of the initial term of the\n      contract, OWNER reserves the right to adjust the charter hire rate\n      at OWNER\u2019s sole discretion.\nCharter 2508 also included a provision prohibiting Smith from sub-chartering\nthe JMC 2508 without Cashman\u2019s permission.\n      Less than a week after executing the agreement, Cashman discovered\nthat Smith had sub-chartered the barge at $5,000 per day to Permaducto SA\nde CV Av. Perferica S/N, a company affiliated with Protexa. Cashman notified\n\n                                      2\n\f    Case: 13-30871    Document: 00512660448    Page: 3   Date Filed: 06/11/2014\n\n\n\n                                No. 13-30871\nSmith that by sub-chartering the barge without its permission it had breached\nBareboat Charter 2508 and jeopardized its ability to recover payments from\nCondux. It therefore demanded the barge\u2019s return. Smith responded with a\npartial payment under the Charter but did not return the barge. Cashman\nagain demanded the barge\u2019s return on October 27. After Smith failed to heed\nthis request, Cashman notified Smith on November 4 that the rate would\nincrease to $5,000 per day starting November 10. The barge was still not\nreturned. Cashman then reported to Smith on November 17 that the price per\nday would increase $1,000 for each day the barge was not returned. Smith\nfinally returned the barge on February 2, 2012, which was 85 days after it was\nrequired to return the boat. All told, Cashman had invoiced Smith sixteen\ntimes, leaving Smith with a total balance of $2,546,433.53.\n      Cashman brought suit against Smith to recover this amount and other\nclaims unrelated to this appeal. The case proceeded to a bench trial, where the\ndistrict court determined that Smith breached Charter 2508 by sub-chartering\nthe JMC 2508 without Cashman\u2019s permission. The district court concluded,\nhowever, that even though Cashman was entitled to adjust the charter hire\nrate pursuant to the language of the Charter, it did not have the discretion to\nimpose the exorbitant daily fees that it had charged Smith.         The court\nconcluded that Cashman was entitled to charge a reasonable daily rate for the\nunreturned barge but had failed to produce any evidence to determine a\nmarket rate for the barge higher than the charter. The district court also\nrejected Cashman\u2019s attempt to recover the $300,000 it claimed it would have\nrecovered from Condux but for Smith\u2019s dealings with Protexa\u2019s affiliates. The\ndistrict court multiplied the original charter rate, $2,200, by the 115 days\nSmith had possession of the barge, then added about $26,000 in other damages,\nto arrive at an award of $228,433.53. Cashman timely appealed.\n\n\n                                      3\n\f    Case: 13-30871     Document: 00512660448    Page: 4    Date Filed: 06/11/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 13-30871\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its\nconclusions of law de novo. French v. Allstate Indem. Co., 637 F.3d 571, 577\n(5th Cir. 2011).     Contract interpretation falls within the latter category.\nMusser Davis Land Co. v. Union Pac. Res., 201 F.3d 561, 563 (5th Cir. 2000).\n\u201c[C]harter party agreements are essentially contracts and they are subject to\nthe general rules of contract law.\u201d Marine Overseas Servs., Inc. v. Crossocean\nShipping Co., Inc., 791 F.2d 1227, 1234 (5th Cir. 1986).\n      The only conclusion of law arguably challenged by Cashman is that the\ndistrict court erred by not allowing it to recover the fees imposed under the\ncontract\u2019s language. The district court\u2019s basis for its determination was that\nCharter 2508\u2019s use of the term \u201cadjust\u201d meant something different than simply\nallowing Cashman to impose inequitable amounts over twenty times the\noriginal daily hire rate.     Contract terms must be given a reasonable\ninterpretation. Makofsky v. Cunningham, 576 F.2d 1223, 1229 (5th Cir. 1978).\nMore fundamentally, the district court found that such exorbitant amounts\nwere inconsistent with the purpose of contract damages, which \u201care meant to\nrestore the injured party to the position he would have occupied had the\nbreaching party performed the contract.\u201d ARV Offshore Co., Ltd. v. Con-Dive,\nL.L.C., 514 F. App\u2019x 524, 527 (5th Cir. 2013). The district court did not err in\nconcluding that Cashman\u2019s adjustments to the daily charter rates were subject\nto a measure of reasonableness and that Cashman\u2019s chosen per diem daily rate,\nwhich reached $69,000 on the final day, was unreasonable as a matter of law.\n      Cashman was entitled to make an adjustment under the contract after\n30 days. There was evidence that a right to adjust rates is common, but those\nadjustments are to respond to changing market conditions during long\ncharters. The adjustment Cashman made was to charge a unilaterally-set\namount for a penalty due to breach of the charter. Cashman produced no\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 13-30871       Document: 00512660448   Page: 5   Date Filed: 06/11/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-30871\nevidence of higher market rates or some alternative and more profitable\ncharter it could have entered. The district court found Cashman\u2019s argument\nto be unconvincing that it could have recovered the $300,000 from Condux if\nnot for Smith\u2019s retention of the barge. On appeal, Cashman argues that the\ndistrict court should have awarded it the $5,000 per day Smith was receiving\nunder the sub-charter. That amount, while less arbitrary than Cashman\u2019s\nescalating charter hire rates, was rejected by the district court because it was\nan amount negotiated by Smith for the sub-charter prior to Cashman\u2019s setting\nthe rate of $2,200 per day for the charter. We find no error when the district\ncourt held that the $5,000 per day rate was not relevant to deciding on an\nadjustment due to changes in the market.\n      Based on the evidence presented, the district court properly found that\nthe only damages Cashman suffered for the refusal to return the barge\nimmediately was the amount of $2,200 as the current market rate for the\ncharter of this barge. This is a finding of fact based on the evidence. It was\nnot clearly erroneous.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f", "TF_IDF_Tags": [], "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "Duplicate": "No", "HTMLtext": "<pre class=\"inline\">     Case: 13-30871      Document: 00512660448         Page: 1    Date Filed: 06/11/2014\n\n\n\n\n           IN THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\n                    FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\n                                                                          United States Court of Appeals\n                                                                                   Fifth Circuit\n                                    No. 13-30871                                 FILED\n                                  Summary Calendar                           June 11, 2014\n                                                                            Lyle W.

Cashman notified\n\n                                      2\n\f    Case: 13-30871    Document: 00512660448    Page: 3   Date Filed: 06/11/2014\n\n\n\n                                No. 13-30871\nSmith that by sub-chartering the barge without its permission it had breached\nBareboat Charter 2508 and jeopardized its ability to recover payments from\nCondux. It therefore demanded the barge\u2019s return. Smith responded with a\npartial payment under the Charter but did not return the barge. Cashman\nagain demanded the barge\u2019s return on October 27. After Smith failed to heed\nthis request, Cashman notified Smith on November 4 that the rate would\nincrease to $5,000 per day starting November 10. The barge was still not\nreturned. Cashman then reported to Smith on November 17 that the price per\nday would increase $1,000 for each day the barge was not returned. Smith\nfinally returned the barge on February 2, 2012, which was 85 days after it was\nrequired to return the boat. All told, Cashman had invoiced Smith sixteen\ntimes, leaving Smith with a total balance of $2,546,433.53.\n      Cashman brought suit against Smith to recover this amount and other\nclaims unrelated to this appeal. The case proceeded to a bench trial, where the\ndistrict court determined that Smith breached Charter 2508 by sub-chartering\nthe JMC 2508 without Cashman\u2019s permission. The district court concluded,\nhowever, that even though Cashman was entitled to adjust the charter hire\nrate pursuant to the language of the Charter, it did not have the discretion to\nimpose the exorbitant daily fees that it had charged Smith.         The court\nconcluded that Cashman was entitled to charge a reasonable daily rate for the\nunreturned barge but had failed to produce any evidence to determine a\nmarket rate for the barge higher than the charter. The district court also\nrejected Cashman\u2019s attempt to recover the $300,000 it claimed it would have\nrecovered from Condux but for Smith\u2019s dealings with Protexa\u2019s affiliates. The\ndistrict court multiplied the original charter rate, $2,200, by the 115 days\nSmith had possession of the barge, then added about $26,000 in other damages,\nto arrive at an award of $228,433.53. Cashman timely appealed.\n\n\n                                      3\n\f    Case: 13-30871     Document: 00512660448    Page: 4    Date Filed: 06/11/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 13-30871\n                                 DISCUSSION\n      We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its\nconclusions of law de novo.

The district court\u2019s basis for its determination was that\nCharter 2508\u2019s use of the term \u201cadjust\u201d meant something different than simply\nallowing Cashman to impose inequitable amounts over twenty times the\noriginal daily hire rate.

Con-Dive,\nL.L.C., 514 F. App\u2019x 524, 527 (5th Cir. 2013). The district court did not err in\nconcluding that Cashman\u2019s adjustments to the daily charter rates were subject\nto a measure of reasonableness and that Cashman\u2019s chosen per diem daily rate,\nwhich reached $69,000 on the final day, was unreasonable as a matter of law.\n      Cashman was entitled to make an adjustment under the contract after\n30 days. There was evidence that a right to adjust rates is common, but those\nadjustments are to respond to changing market conditions during long\ncharters. The adjustment Cashman made was to charge a unilaterally-set\namount for a penalty due to breach of the charter. Cashman produced no\n                                       4\n\f    Case: 13-30871       Document: 00512660448   Page: 5   Date Filed: 06/11/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 13-30871\nevidence of higher market rates or some alternative and more profitable\ncharter it could have entered. The district court found Cashman\u2019s argument\nto be unconvincing that it could have recovered the $300,000 from Condux if\nnot for Smith\u2019s retention of the barge. On appeal, Cashman argues that the\ndistrict court should have awarded it the $5,000 per day Smith was receiving\nunder the sub-charter. That amount, while less arbitrary than Cashman\u2019s\nescalating charter hire rates, was rejected by the district court because it was\nan amount negotiated by Smith for the sub-charter prior to Cashman\u2019s setting\nthe rate of $2,200 per day for the charter. We find no error when the district\ncourt held that the $5,000 per day rate was not relevant to deciding on an\nadjustment due to changes in the market.\n      Based on the evidence presented, the district court properly found that\nthe only damages Cashman suffered for the refusal to return the barge\nimmediately was the amount of $2,200 as the current market rate for the\ncharter of this barge. This is a finding of fact based on the evidence. It was\nnot clearly erroneous.\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        5\n\f</pre>", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false}
