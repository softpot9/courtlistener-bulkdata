TAYLOR AND KELIN A. STEVENS\n\n   ON APPEAL FROM THE TWENTY-FOURTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n           COURT FOR THE PARISH OF JEFFERSON\n\n\nHUGHES, J.\n\n      In 2012 by a seventy-three percent majority the people voted to amend\n\nArticle I, Section 11 of the Louisiana Constitution, effective December 10, 2012,\n\nwhich now provides:\n\n      The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms is fundamental and\n\nshall not be infringed. Any restriction of this right shall be subject to strict\n\nscrutiny.\n\n      Prior to its amendment this article provided that, \u201cThe right of each citizen\n\nto keep and bear arms shall not be abridged, but this provision shall not prevent the\n\npassage of laws to prohibit the carrying of weapons concealed on the person.\u201d\n\n      The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen and protect from government\n\nintrusion the right of our citizens to keep and bear arms. While many have always\n\fconsidered the right fundamental, that has now been made clear, and any\n\nrestriction may occur only after the highest level of review, \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d\n\n      Some arrested or convicted of crimes involving firearms have attempted to\n\nshow that the laws under which they were charged do not withstand strict scrutiny\n\nand are thus unconstitutional.\n\n      In these consolidated cases we now reject those arguments.              Our law\n\nproscribing the possession of firearms by convicted felons is not affected by the\n\namendment and withstands a strict scrutiny analysis. Such laws are effective,\n\ntime-tested, and easily understandable, and do not violate the constitution.\n\nCommon sense and the public safety allow no other result.\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      In the case of State v. Eberhardt, the September 17, 2012 St. Tammany\n\nParish felony bill of information charged Eberhardt with:           (1) one count of\n\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1,\n\nalleging that, on or about June 27, 2012, he illegally possessed a firearm, having\n\nbeen previously convicted of the unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, a\n\nviolation of LSA-R.S. 14:62.3, on June 11, 2007 in St. Tammany Parish; (2) one\n\ncount of theft, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:67, alleging that, between March 6, 2012\n\nand June 25, 2012, he misappropriated or took over $1,500 worth of property\n\nbelonging to Faye Eberhardt; and (3) one count of cyberstalking, a violation of\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:40.3(B)(1), alleging that, on or between November 7, 2010 and\n\nAugust 30, 2011, via electronic mail or electronic communication of words or\n\nlanguage, he threatened to inflict bodily harm to a person or such person\u2019s child,\n\nsibling, spouse, or dependant, or physical injury to the property of a person, or for\n\nthe purpose of extorting money or other things of value from a person. Eberhardt\n\nwas also charged by a September 17, 2012 misdemeanor bill of information with\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fone count of first offense possession of marijuana, a violation of LSA-R.S.\n\n40:966(C) and (E)(1), which occurred on or about June 26, 2012.\n\n       In the case of State v. Taylor, a May 10, 2012 Jefferson Parish grand jury\n\nindictment charged defendants Taylor and Stevens, each, with one count of second\n\ndegree murder, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:30.1, alleging that, on January 6, 2012,\n\nthe defendants committed the second degree murder of \u201ca Known Juvenile (DOB\n\n2/23/2000).\u201d1\n\n       In addition to the charge of second degree murder, Taylor was also charged\n\nwith: (1) five counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, violations of\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:95.1, alleging that, on June 21, 2011, August 2, 2011, November 22,\n\n2011, January 6, 2012, and January 9, 2012, he illegally possessed a firearm,\n\nhaving been previously convicted of possession of cocaine in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana; (2) one count of attempt to\n\ncommit the second degree murder of Derrick Ford on November 22, 2011, a\n\nviolation of LSA-R.S. 14:27 and 14:30.1; and (3) one count of possession with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine, a violation of LSA-R.S. 40:967(A).\n\n       In addition to the charge of second degree murder allegedly committed with\n\nco-defendant Taylor, Stevens was also charged with two counts of possession of a\n\nfirearm by a convicted felon, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, alleging that, on\n\nJune 8, 2011 and January 6, 2012, he illegally possessed a firearm, having been\n\npreviously convicted of second degree battery, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:34.1,\n\nand of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a violation of LSA-R.S.\n\n40:966(A).\n\n       Eberhardt, Taylor, and Stevens all filed motions to quash the felon-in-\n\npossession charges against them, in their respective district court proceedings,\n\n1\n On July 12, 2012, a third co-defendant, Brandon J. Smith, was joined, along with Taylor and\nStevens, in the second degree murder charge; however, Smith was not charged with LSA-R.S.\n14:95.1 and did not join in contesting the constitutionality of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.\n\n                                             3\n\fasserting the unconstitutionality of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, which they contend\n\nimpermissibly infringes on their fundamental right to keep and bear arms, as set\n\nforth in LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11. The Jefferson Parish district court ruled in favor\n\nof Taylor and Stevens, granting these defendants\u2019 motions to quash, and the State\n\nappealed the declaration of the ruling of unconstitutionality as to LSA-R.S.\n\n14:95.1. The St. Tammany Parish district court denied Eberhardt\u2019s motion to\n\nquash, and he filed a writ application with this court, which was granted. See\n\nState v. Eberhardt, 2013-2306 (La. 2/14/14), ___ So.3d ___. These cases were\n\nconsolidated for review in this court as they present the same issue, i.e., whether\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is unconstitutional, as violative of LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11.\n\n       In appealing the ruling of unconstitutionality rendered in State v. Taylor,\n\nthe State asserts in its assignments of error that the Jefferson Parish district court\n\nerred in finding that: (1) felons are entitled to the right conferred by LSA-Const.\n\nart. 1, \u00a7 11; (2) LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is facially unconstitutional; and (3) LSA-R.S.\n\n14:95.1 is unconstitutional as applied to the defendants. In conjunction with his\n\napplication for supervisory review, Eberhardt contends the St. Tammany Parish\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to hold LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 unconstitutional.\n\n       A motion by the Louisiana District Attorneys Association (\u201cLDAA\u201d)\n\nseeking to file an amicus curiae brief in this court was granted, and the LDAA has\n\nsubmitted arguments in support of the constitutionality of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.\n\n                                 LAW AND ANALYSIS\n\n       Our standard of review in determining the constitutionality of a statute, a\n\nquestion of law, is de novo.2 See State v.

A motion to quash is essentially a mechanism whereby pre-trial pleas, which do not go to\nthe merits of the charge, are urged. See State v.

A de novo review means the court will render judgment after its\n\nconsideration of the legislative provisions at issue, the law, and the record, without\n\ndeference to the legal conclusions of the tribunals below. City of Bossier City v.\n\nVernon, 100 So.3d at 303.\n\n       The defendants herein have challenged the validity of the charges against\n\nthem under LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, which makes it unlawful for any person convicted\n\nof certain felonies to possess a firearm or carry a concealed weapon. Because the\n\nright to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right, as described in LSA-Const. art.\n\nI, \u00a7 11, a statute restricting that right (here, LSA-R.S. 14:95.1) must survive the\n\ntest of \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d a test which is mentioned in LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11, but\n\nnot defined. See State v. Webb, ___ So.3d at ___.\n\n       Under strict scrutiny the government bears the burden of proving the\n\nconstitutionality of the regulation by showing: (1) that the regulation serves a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, and (2) that the regulation is narrowly tailored\n\nto serve that compelling interest. State v. Draughter, 130 So.3d at 862. Strict\n\nscrutiny requires a careful examination by our courts, keeping in mind that the\n\nfundamental right at issue is one where some degree of regulation is likely to be\n\nnecessary to protect the public safety. State in the Interest of J.M., ___ So.3d at\n\n___ (quoting Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 327, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 2338, 156\n\nL.Ed.2d 304 (2003), which stated that in a strict scrutiny analysis \u201ccontext\n\nmatters\u201d).\n\n       The defendants contend, and the Jefferson Parish district court ruled, that\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is unconstitutional on its face, as violative of LSA-Const. art. I,\n\n\u00a7 11. The defendants further contend that LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is unconstitutional as\n\napplied to their individual circumstances.\n\n                                          5\n\f      Revised Statute 14:95.1 provides:\n\n            A. It is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a\n      crime of violence as defined in R.S. 14:2(B) which is a felony or\n      simple burglary, burglary of a pharmacy, burglary of an inhabited\n      dwelling, unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, felony illegal\n      use of weapons or dangerous instrumentalities, manufacture or\n      possession of a delayed action incendiary device, manufacture or\n      possession of a bomb, or possession of a firearm while in the\n      possession of or during the sale or distribution of a controlled\n      dangerous substance, or any violation of the Uniform Controlled\n      Dangerous Substances Law which is a felony, or any crime which is\n      defined as a sex offense in R.S. 15:541, or any crime defined as an\n      attempt to commit one of the above-enumerated offenses under the\n      laws of this state, or who has been convicted under the laws of any\n      other state or of the United States or of any foreign government or\n      country of a crime which, if committed in this state, would be one of\n      the above-enumerated crimes, to possess a firearm or carry a\n      concealed weapon.\n\n            B. Whoever is found guilty of violating the provisions of this\n      Section shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than ten nor\n      more than twenty years without the benefit of probation, parole, or\n      suspension of sentence and be fined not less than one thousand dollars\n      nor more than five thousand dollars. Notwithstanding the provisions\n      of R.S. 14:27, whoever is found guilty of attempting to violate the\n      provisions of this Section shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not\n      more than seven and one-half years and fined not less than five\n      hundred dollars nor more than two thousand five hundred dollars.\n\n             C. The provisions of this Section prohibiting the possession of\n      firearms and carrying concealed weapons by persons who have been\n      convicted of certain felonies shall not apply to any person who has not\n      been convicted of any felony for a period of ten years from the date of\n      completion of sentence, probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n\n            D. For the purposes of this Section, \u201cfirearm\u201d means any pistol,\n      revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, submachine gun, black powder\n      weapon, or assault rifle which is designed to fire or is capable of firing\n      fixed cartridge ammunition or from which a shot or projectile is\n      discharged by an explosive.\n\n      Subsequent to the 2012 amendment of LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11, this court\n\nconsidered the constitutionality of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 in State v. Draughter, 2013-\n\n0914 (La. 12/10/13), 130 So.3d 855, and the constitutionality challenge to LSA-\n\nR.S. 14:95.1 was rejected in the limited circumstances presented in that case, i.e.,\n\nvis-\u00e0-vis a defendant who had been released from the physical custody of the State,\n\nbut who continued to be subject to State supervision, on active probation, for his\n\n                                          6\n\fprior conviction. We held that the State has a compelling interest in regulating\n\nconvicted felons still under the State\u2019s supervision, and LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. This court concluded that LSA-R.S.\n\n14:95.1 survives strict scrutiny and was not an unconstitutional infringement of\n\nDraughter\u2019s right to bear arms, pursuant to Article I, Section 11, as applied to the\n\nnarrow fact situation presented in that case. This court\u2019s conclusion in State v.\n\nDraughter was easily reached given that the defendant was still under State\n\nsupervision and was serving the probation portion of his criminal sentence, which\n\nnecessarily involved an intrusion into the defendant\u2019s life by the State officials\n\nadministering the supervision required by his status. The possession of a firearm\n\nby such a defendant was found to be inconsistent with that status and would\n\nsubject the individuals tasked with his supervision to an untenable safety risk. We\n\ndeclined to address the \u201clarger question\u201d of whether the State may dispossess\n\ncertain convicted felons of their right to bear arms for a number of years, even after\n\nthey have paid their debt to society and fully discharged their sentences, having\n\ndetermined that precise question was not before the court.             See State v.\n\nDraughter, 130 So.3d at 866-68.\n\n      Since deciding State v. Draughter, we have examined the 2012 amendment\n\nto LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 in State in the Interest of J.M. (with respect to LSA-\n\nR.S. 14:95(A), making illegal the carrying of an intentionally concealed firearm on\n\none\u2019s person, and LSA-R.S. 14:95.8, making unlawful the possession of a handgun\n\nby a person under the age of seventeen except in certain enumerated\n\ncircumstances), and in State v. Webb (with respect to LSA-R.S. 14:95(E), making\n\nunlawful the possession of a firearm while in the possession of or during the sale or\n\ndistribution of a controlled dangerous substance). In both State in the Interest of\n\nJ.M. and State v. Webb, this court upheld the challenged statutes against the\n\ndefendants\u2019 claims that these statutes unconstitutionality violated LSA-Const. art.\n\n                                          7\n\fI, \u00a7 11, concluding that each of the challenged statutes was enacted pursuant to\n\ncompelling government interests and that each was narrowly tailored to achieve\n\nlegitimate government purposes.\n\n       While the status of the defendants in the instant consolidated cases differs\n\nfrom those at issue in State v. Draughter, in that the Draughter defendants were\n\nstill under State supervision at the time of their arrests and the instant defendants\n\nhad completed all aspects of their prior sentences and were no longer under State\n\nsupervision when they were arrested on subsequent offenses, we nevertheless\n\nuphold the validity of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.\n\n       We begin our analysis of the current LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11-based\n\nchallenges to LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 by pointing out that we recognized in Draughter\n\nthat the right to bear arms has always been considered fundamental. The 2012\n\namendment to LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 merely sought to ensure that the review\n\nstandard of an alleged infringement of this fundamental right was in keeping with\n\nthe refinements made to constitutional analysis that developed since our decision in\n\nState v. Amos, 343 So.2d 166 (La. 1977).3 See State v. Draughter, 130 So.3d at\n\n863. The 2012 amendment of LSA-Const. art. 1, \u00a7 11 did not, therefore, effect a\n\nchange in the nature of the right by adding the term \u201cfundamental\u201d to describe the\n\nright to keep and bear arms. State v. Webb, ___ So.3d at ___ n.3\n\n\n\n3\n  State v. Draughter further recognized that the 2012 amendment to LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 was\nprompted in part by the slim 5-to-4 Supreme Court majority decisions in the recent cases of\nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008) (holding\nthat the Second Amendment\u2019s right to keep and bear arms extended beyond participation in a\ncitizen militia to \u201claw-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home\u201d\nand invalidating the District of Columbia\u2019s total ban on the possession of handguns and the\nrequirement that citizens keep their firearms inoperative, as the requirement made it impossible\nfor citizens to use firearms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense), and McDonald v. City\nof Chicago, 561 U.S. 742, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010) (holding that the Second\nAmendment\u2019s individual right to bear arms, recognized in Heller, is a right fundamental to our\nscheme of ordered liberty and fully applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment). Partly in response to Heller and McDonald, Louisiana legislators\nintroduced legislation that ultimately resulted in the 2012 amendment of the State constitution,\nwith the stated intention being to secure and protect Louisiana citizens\u2019 right to bear arms under\nthe Louisiana Constitution from possible future judicial or legislative erosion.\n\n                                                8\n\f      As we recognized in State v. Amos, the right to keep and bear arms, like\n\nother rights guaranteed by our State constitution, is not absolute. Further, the\n\nSupreme Court described a similar understanding of the nature and limitations of\n\nthe right to bear arms in the analogous Second Amendment, in District of\n\nColumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 2816, 171 L.Ed.2d 637\n\n(2008), stating, \u201cFrom Blackstone through the 19th-century cases, commentators\n\nand courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any\n\nweapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d See\n\nState in the Interest of J.M., ___ So.3d at ___.\n\n      This court concluded in State in the Interest of J.M. that the voters\u2019\n\nratification of strict scrutiny as a standard of review to be applied to alleged\n\ninfringements on the right to keep and bear arms was not meant to invalidate every\n\nrestriction on firearms, whether in existence at the time the amendment was ratified\n\nor yet to be enacted. Rather, the strict scrutiny standard adopted by the voters is\n\n\u201cdesigned to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and\n\nsincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker\u201d for firearm\n\nregulation within the context of the fundamental right to keep and bear arms. State\n\nin the Interest of J.M., ___ So.3d at ___ (quoting Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S.\n\nat 327, 123 S.Ct. at 2338).\n\n      A measure of ambiguity was created by the fact that the legislature, in its\n\n2012 amendment of LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11, omitted from its prior text the phrase\n\n\u201cbut this provision shall not prevent the passage of laws to prohibit the carrying of\n\nweapons concealed on the person\u201d and by calling for \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d of any\n\nrestriction on the right to keep and bear arms. Therefore, consideration of the\n\nlegislative history is appropriate. See Louisiana Federation of Teachers v. State\n\nof Louisiana, 2013-0120 (La. 5/7/13), 118 So.3d 1033, 1061.\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      A discussion of the proposed amendment to LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11, by\n\nSenate Bill No. 303 (later passed as 2012 La. Acts, No. 874), took place on the\n\nSenate floor, which is instructive on the issues before this court. 4 During the\n\nSenate discussion, the bill\u2019s sponsor, Senator Riser, answered questions about the\n\nmeaning and effect of the bill, raised by Senators Claitor, Thompson, Donahue,\n\nAppel, and Long. Senator Riser stated that the purpose of the act was to reinforce\n\nthe Second Amendment in Louisiana law, so that Louisiana would have the\n\nstrongest Second Amendment law in the nation should the amendment pass. The\n\naim of the legislature in amending LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 was described by\n\nSenator Riser as protecting the fundamental right of individuals to keep and bear\n\narms, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow 5-to-4 majority opinions in District\n\nof Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago. However, when\n\nspecifically questioned about the effect the proposed act would have on existing\n\ngun laws, Senator Riser stated, \u201c[T]his [act] defines . . . how laws are judged . . . .\n\n[W]e roughly have close to forty gun laws right now and those laws will stay in\n\neffect.\u201d Senator Riser further stated, \u201cAny [weapon] law on the books right now is\n\non the books [and] they are going to stay there . . . . You\u2019ll have to follow the\n\ncurrent statute[s].\u201d From these discussions, we can conclude that, in passing Act\n\n874, the legislature did not intend to invalidate existing weapons laws.\n\n      As declared by this court in State v. Amos, it is beyond question that the\n\nstatute challenged in the instant case, LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, was passed in the interest\n\nof the public and as an exercise of the police power vested in the legislature. Its\n\npurpose is to limit the possession of firearms by persons who, by their past\n\ncommission of certain specified serious felonies, have demonstrated a dangerous\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The recorded April 9, 2012 Senate discussion is archived on the Louisiana Senate website\n(http://senate.la.gov/sessioninfo/Archives/2012/rs.htm at 01:57:44).\n\n                                           10\n\fdisregard for the law and present a potential threat of further or future criminal\n\nactivity. State v. Amos, 343 So.2d at 168.\n\n       State v. Amos further acknowledged that LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is addressed to\n\npersons who are citizens of this State by virtue of the termination of state or federal\n\nsupervision following their convictions, pursuant to LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 20.5\n\nThese persons have previously been convicted of serious criminal offenses, and\n\nrestoration of citizenship cannot erase this fact.              The State v. Amos opinion\n\nrecognized that the verbatim transcripts of the constitutional convention debates\n\nindicated that neither LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 nor LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 20 were ever\n\nintended to preclude the type of legislation disputed herein. We are satisfied that it\n\nis reasonable for the legislature in the interest of public welfare and safety to\n\nregulate the possession of firearms, for a limited period of time, by citizens who\n\nhave committed certain specified serious felonies. Courts of other states having\n\nstatutes and constitutional provisions comparable to our own have similarly\n\nconcluded that such regulation is constitutionally permissible as a reasonable and\n\nlegitimate exercise of police power. See State v. Amos, 343 So.2d at 168. We\n\nconclude that the precepts set forth in State v. Amos continue to be valid and\n\napplicable today.\n\n       We also note that in District of Columbia v. Heller the Supreme Court, in\n\nevaluating the analogous Second Amendment right to bear arms, stated that\n\n\u201cnothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions\n\non the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the\n\ncarrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings,\n\n\n5\n  Article I, Section 20 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cFull rights of citizenship shall be restored\nupon termination of state and federal supervision following conviction for any offense.\u201d\nNevertheless, this court held in State v. Adams, 355 So.2d 917, 922 (La. 1978), that LSA-Const.\nart. 1, \u00a7 20 restores only the basic rights of citizenship, such as the right to vote, work, or hold\npublic office. See State v. Selmon, 343 So.2d 720, 721-22 (La. 1977). See also U.S. v.\nDupaquier, 907 F.Supp. 951, 953-57 (M.D. La. 1995).\n\n                                                11\n\for laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d\n\nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. at 626-27, 128 S.Ct. at 2816-17. See\n\nalso McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. at ___, 130 S.Ct. at 3047; U.S. v.\n\nYancey, 621 F.3d 681, 685 (7th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[S]omeone with a felony conviction\n\non his record is more likely than a nonfelon to engage in illegal and violent gun\n\nuse.\u201d).\n\n       We conclude that LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 serves a compelling governmental\n\ninterest that has long been jurisprudentially recognized and is grounded in the\n\nlegislature\u2019s intent to protect the safety of the general public from felons convicted\n\nof specified serious crimes, who have demonstrated a dangerous disregard for the\n\nlaw and the safety of others and who present a potential threat of further or future\n\ncriminal activity. See State v. Amos, 343 So.2d at 168. Further, the law is\n\nnarrowly tailored in its application to the possession of firearms or the carrying of\n\nconcealed weapons for a period of only ten years from the date of completion of\n\nsentence, probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, and to only those convicted\n\nof the enumerated felonies determined by the legislature to be offenses having the\n\nactual or potential danger of harm to other members of the general public.6 Under\n\nthese circumstances, we find \u201ca long history, a substantial consensus, and simple\n\ncommon sense\u201d to be sufficient evidence for even a strict scrutiny review. State in\n\nthe Interest of J.M., ___ So.3d at ___ (quoting Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S.\n\n191, 211, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1858, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992)).\n\n       Furthermore, to challenge a legislative act as unconstitutional on its face is\n\nthe most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must\n\n\n6\n  We note that Louisiana\u2019s LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 felon-in-possession law is less restrictive than the\ncomparable federal law, which encompasses nearly all felonies and has no ten-year cleansing\nperiod.

Generally, the legislature may do anything that the\n\nconstitution does not prohibit. The task is to determine whether the challenged\n\nstatute is so inconsistent with our constitution that there exists no set of\n\ncircumstances under which the statute would be valid. See Prejean v. Barousse,\n\n107 So.3d at 572. See also Washington State Grange v.

No such showing can be made\n\nin the instant case; as seen in State v. Draughter, circumstances clearly exist\n\nwhere LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is valid. Therefore, we find no merit in the defendants\u2019\n\nfacial challenge to LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.\n\n      We also reject the defendants\u2019 argument that LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is\n\nunconstitutional as applied to their individual circumstances.\n\n      Each of the three defendants reoffended within a relatively short period of\n\ntime following the completion of previously imposed State supervision. Stevens\n\nwas released from State supervision on his prior conviction for possession of\n\nmarijuana on May 18, 2011, and he was charged with committing a violation of\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:95.1 on June 8, 2011, only three weeks later. Eberhardt was released\n\nfrom State supervision on his prior conviction of unauthorized entry of an\n\ninhabited dwelling on May 30, 2010, and he was charged with committing a\n\nviolation of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 on June 27, 2012, approximately two years later\n\n                                         13\n\f(though we note that the third count of the indictment against Eberhardt charged\n\nhim with cyberstalking, which had allegedly commenced on or about November 7,\n\n2010, only twenty-three weeks after completion of his prior State supervision).\n\nTaylor completed his prior federal sentence for possession of cocaine and was\n\nreleased from federal supervision on June 1, 2007, and he was charged with\n\ncommitting a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 on June 21, 2011, approximately four\n\nyears later.\n\n       These three defendants illustrate, rather than show exceptions to, the\n\nprinciples underlying felon-in-possession laws such as LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, i.e., that\n\ncertain convicted felons have demonstrated a dangerous disregard for the law and\n\npresent a potential threat of further or future criminal activity and are more likely\n\nthan nonfelons to engage in illegal and violent gun use. These cases demonstrate\n\nthat convicted felons are not only at risk to reoffend, but are at risk to reoffend\n\nusing firearms.\n\n       In the case of Taylor and Stevens, a firearm was used in the second degree\n\nmurder for which they are charged as co-defendants in this case. This is exactly\n\nthe type of offense LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 was enacted to prevent.\n\n       In Eberhardt\u2019s case, his weapon possession offense does not appear to be\n\nconnected to his other charged offenses of cyberstalking and theft. Eberhardt\n\nfurther suggests that his prior offense of unauthorized entry of an inhabited\n\ndwelling had no connection to possession of a firearm and that, therefore, as\n\napplied to his circumstances, LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is not narrowly tailored to ensure\n\npublic safety. We find no merit in Eberhardt\u2019s argument. While Eberhardt might\n\nnot have armed himself before committing unauthorized entry of an inhabited\n\ndwelling, the entry by an unauthorized person into the residence of another\n\npresents a situation of potential harm to the occupant who may resist the intrusion,\n\nin that the offender may nevertheless acquire a weapon on the premises and use it\n\n                                         14\n\fto cause harm to others. Moreover, some inhabited dwelling offenders go on to\n\nreoffend with a weapon. See State v. Wiggins, 2013-0649 (La. App. 1 Cir.\n\n1/31/14), ___ So.3d ___ (wherein the defendant was previously convicted of\n\nsimple burglary of an inhabited dwelling and subsequently reoffended with a\n\nfirearm and attempted to kill his victim); State v. Shepherd, 2008-1556 (La. App.\n\n3 Cir. 6/3/09), 11 So.3d 729 (wherein the defendant entered the residence of the\n\nvictim, without authorization, and then armed himself with the victim\u2019s weapon\n\nand shot the victim in the chest). We do not find as applied over-inclusiveness in\n\nEberhardt\u2019s case. The offense of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling\n\ncarries such a high potential for harm to innocent bystanders that its inclusion by\n\nthe legislature within the ambit of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is clearly warranted.\n\nFurthermore, it is impossible for the legislature to predict with complete certainty\n\nwhich offenders will reoffend with a firearm, and including those offenses that\n\ndemonstrate a serious disregard for the safety of others within LSA-R.S. 14:95.1\u2019s\n\nfelon-in-possession prohibition is appropriate given the compelling state interest in\n\nprotecting the public.7\n\n\n\n7\n  Eberhardt also cites the first offender pardon he received from the Department of Public Safety\nand Corrections (\u201cDPSC\u201d) after completing his probation; the June 24, 2010 DPSC notice stated\nthat Eberhardt had completed his sentence for unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling and\nhad met all of the requirements for an automatic first offender pardon, under LSA-R.S.\n15:572(D), and further stated: \u201c[A]s provided by Article 1, Section 20, and Article 4, Section\n5(E)(1), of the Louisiana Constitution, this will certify that effective May 30, 2010,\nCHRISTOPHER EBERHARDT has discharged his/her sentence for the above stated offense(s)\nand that all rights of citizenship and franchise are restored in Louisiana.\u201d However, the\n\u201cverification of first offender pardon\u201d received by Eberhardt also notified him that \u201c[t]he right to\nreceive, possess or transport a firearm may not be restored unless all legal provisions are met and\nshould be determined through the local law enforcement agency.\u201d At the time the June 24, 2010\nnotice was sent to Eberhardt, LSA-R.S. 14:95.1(C) provided that, in addition to the ten-year\ncleansing period, a convicted felon who had completed his sentence, probation, parole, or\nsuspension of sentence could apply to the sheriff of the parish in which he resided for a permit to\npossess a firearm; this discretionary sheriff\u2019s permit procedure was repealed by the Louisiana\nLegislature by 2010 La. Acts, No. 942, \u00a7 1, effective August 1, 2010. There is no indication that\nEberhardt applied for a sheriff\u2019s permit to possess a firearm between his date of eligibility, May\n30, 2010, and the date that the repeal of the sheriff\u2019s permit provision became effective, August\n1, 2010. In the absence of such a permit, the restoration of citizenship rights accorded by an\nLSA-R.S. 15:572(D) automatic pardon to first offenders does not exempt such an offender from\nthe application of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1. See State v. Wiggins, 432 So.2d 234, 236-37 (La. 1983);\nState v. Riser, 30,201 (La. App. 2 Cir. 12/12/97), 704 So.2d 946, 949-50.\n\n                                                15\n\f      We find no merit in the as applied challenges asserted by these defendants.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      We conclude that LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is not unconstitutional as violative of\n\nLSA-Const. art.

STEVENS\n\n   ON APPEAL FROM THE TWENTY-FOURTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n           COURT FOR THE PARISH OF JEFFERSON\n\n\nHUGHES, J.\n\n      In 2012 by a seventy-three percent majority the people voted to amend\n\nArticle I, Section 11 of the Louisiana Constitution, effective December 10, 2012,\n\nwhich now provides:\n\n      The right of each citizen to keep and bear arms is fundamental and\n\nshall not be infringed. Any restriction of this right shall be subject to strict\n\nscrutiny.\n\n      Prior to its amendment this article provided that, \u201cThe right of each citizen\n\nto keep and bear arms shall not be abridged, but this provision shall not prevent the\n\npassage of laws to prohibit the carrying of weapons concealed on the person.\u201d\n\n      The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen and protect from government\n\nintrusion the right of our citizens to keep and bear arms. While many have always\n\fconsidered the right fundamental, that has now been made clear, and any\n\nrestriction may occur only after the highest level of review, \u201cstrict scrutiny.\u201d\n\n      Some arrested or convicted of crimes involving firearms have attempted to\n\nshow that the laws under which they were charged do not withstand strict scrutiny\n\nand are thus unconstitutional.\n\n      In these consolidated cases we now reject those arguments.              Our law\n\nproscribing the possession of firearms by convicted felons is not affected by the\n\namendment and withstands a strict scrutiny analysis. Such laws are effective,\n\ntime-tested, and easily understandable, and do not violate the constitution.\n\nCommon sense and the public safety allow no other result.\n\n                    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      In the case of State v. Eberhardt, the September 17, 2012 St. Tammany\n\nParish felony bill of information charged Eberhardt with:           (1) one count of\n\npossession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1,\n\nalleging that, on or about June 27, 2012, he illegally possessed a firearm, having\n\nbeen previously convicted of the unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, a\n\nviolation of LSA-R.S. 14:62.3, on June 11, 2007 in St. Tammany Parish; (2) one\n\ncount of theft, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:67, alleging that, between March 6, 2012\n\nand June 25, 2012, he misappropriated or took over $1,500 worth of property\n\nbelonging to Faye Eberhardt; and (3) one count of cyberstalking, a violation of\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:40.3(B)(1), alleging that, on or between November 7, 2010 and\n\nAugust 30, 2011, via electronic mail or electronic communication of words or\n\nlanguage, he threatened to inflict bodily harm to a person or such person\u2019s child,\n\nsibling, spouse, or dependant, or physical injury to the property of a person, or for\n\nthe purpose of extorting money or other things of value from a person. Eberhardt\n\nwas also charged by a September 17, 2012 misdemeanor bill of information with\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fone count of first offense possession of marijuana, a violation of LSA-R.S.\n\n40:966(C) and (E)(1), which occurred on or about June 26, 2012.\n\n       In the case of State v. Taylor, a May 10, 2012 Jefferson Parish grand jury\n\nindictment charged defendants Taylor and Stevens, each, with one count of second\n\ndegree murder, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:30.1, alleging that, on January 6, 2012,\n\nthe defendants committed the second degree murder of \u201ca Known Juvenile (DOB\n\n2/23/2000).\u201d1\n\n       In addition to the charge of second degree murder, Taylor was also charged\n\nwith: (1) five counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, violations of\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:95.1, alleging that, on June 21, 2011, August 2, 2011, November 22,\n\n2011, January 6, 2012, and January 9, 2012, he illegally possessed a firearm,\n\nhaving been previously convicted of possession of cocaine in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana; (2) one count of attempt to\n\ncommit the second degree murder of Derrick Ford on November 22, 2011, a\n\nviolation of LSA-R.S. 14:27 and 14:30.1; and (3) one count of possession with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine, a violation of LSA-R.S. 40:967(A).\n\n       In addition to the charge of second degree murder allegedly committed with\n\nco-defendant Taylor, Stevens was also charged with two counts of possession of a\n\nfirearm by a convicted felon, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, alleging that, on\n\nJune 8, 2011 and January 6, 2012, he illegally possessed a firearm, having been\n\npreviously convicted of second degree battery, a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:34.1,\n\nand of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a violation of LSA-R.S.\n\n40:966(A).\n\n       Eberhardt, Taylor, and Stevens all filed motions to quash the felon-in-\n\npossession charges against them, in their respective district court proceedings,\n\n1\n On July 12, 2012, a third co-defendant, Brandon J. Smith, was joined, along with Taylor and\nStevens, in the second degree murder charge; however, Smith was not charged with LSA-R.S.\n14:95.1 and did not join in contesting the constitutionality of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.\n\n                                             3\n\fasserting the unconstitutionality of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, which they contend\n\nimpermissibly infringes on their fundamental right to keep and bear arms, as set\n\nforth in LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11. The Jefferson Parish district court ruled in favor\n\nof Taylor and Stevens, granting these defendants\u2019 motions to quash, and the State\n\nappealed the declaration of the ruling of unconstitutionality as to LSA-R.S.\n\n14:95.1. The St. Tammany Parish district court denied Eberhardt\u2019s motion to\n\nquash, and he filed a writ application with this court, which was granted. See\n\nState v. Eberhardt, 2013-2306 (La. 2/14/14), ___ So.3d ___. These cases were\n\nconsolidated for review in this court as they present the same issue, i.e., whether\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is unconstitutional, as violative of LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11.\n\n       In appealing the ruling of unconstitutionality rendered in State v. Taylor,\n\nthe State asserts in its assignments of error that the Jefferson Parish district court\n\nerred in finding that: (1) felons are entitled to the right conferred by LSA-Const.\n\nart. 1, \u00a7 11; (2) LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is facially unconstitutional; and (3) LSA-R.S.\n\n14:95.1 is unconstitutional as applied to the defendants. In conjunction with his\n\napplication for supervisory review, Eberhardt contends the St. Tammany Parish\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to hold LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 unconstitutional.\n\n       A motion by the Louisiana District Attorneys Association (\u201cLDAA\u201d)\n\nseeking to file an amicus curiae brief in this court was granted, and the LDAA has\n\nsubmitted arguments in support of the constitutionality of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.\n\n                                 LAW AND ANALYSIS\n\n       Our standard of review in determining the constitutionality of a statute, a\n\nquestion of law, is de novo.2 See State v. Webb, 2013-1681 (La. 5/7/14), ___\n\n\n2\n  These consolidated cases present no factual issues, as the rulings under review were made\nfollowing hearings, in the respective district court proceedings, on the defendants\u2019 motions to\nquash. A motion to quash is essentially a mechanism whereby pre-trial pleas, which do not go to\nthe merits of the charge, are urged. See State v.

Because the\n\nright to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right, as described in LSA-Const. art.\n\nI, \u00a7 11, a statute restricting that right (here, LSA-R.S. 14:95.1) must survive the\n\ntest of \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d a test which is mentioned in LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11, but\n\nnot defined. See State v. Webb, ___ So.3d at ___.\n\n       Under strict scrutiny the government bears the burden of proving the\n\nconstitutionality of the regulation by showing: (1) that the regulation serves a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, and (2) that the regulation is narrowly tailored\n\nto serve that compelling interest. State v. Draughter, 130 So.3d at 862. Strict\n\nscrutiny requires a careful examination by our courts, keeping in mind that the\n\nfundamental right at issue is one where some degree of regulation is likely to be\n\nnecessary to protect the public safety.

It is unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a\n      crime of violence as defined in R.S. 14:2(B) which is a felony or\n      simple burglary, burglary of a pharmacy, burglary of an inhabited\n      dwelling, unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling, felony illegal\n      use of weapons or dangerous instrumentalities, manufacture or\n      possession of a delayed action incendiary device, manufacture or\n      possession of a bomb, or possession of a firearm while in the\n      possession of or during the sale or distribution of a controlled\n      dangerous substance, or any violation of the Uniform Controlled\n      Dangerous Substances Law which is a felony, or any crime which is\n      defined as a sex offense in R.S. 15:541, or any crime defined as an\n      attempt to commit one of the above-enumerated offenses under the\n      laws of this state, or who has been convicted under the laws of any\n      other state or of the United States or of any foreign government or\n      country of a crime which, if committed in this state, would be one of\n      the above-enumerated crimes, to possess a firearm or carry a\n      concealed weapon.\n\n            B. Whoever is found guilty of violating the provisions of this\n      Section shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than ten nor\n      more than twenty years without the benefit of probation, parole, or\n      suspension of sentence and be fined not less than one thousand dollars\n      nor more than five thousand dollars. Notwithstanding the provisions\n      of R.S. 14:27, whoever is found guilty of attempting to violate the\n      provisions of this Section shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not\n      more than seven and one-half years and fined not less than five\n      hundred dollars nor more than two thousand five hundred dollars.\n\n             C. The provisions of this Section prohibiting the possession of\n      firearms and carrying concealed weapons by persons who have been\n      convicted of certain felonies shall not apply to any person who has not\n      been convicted of any felony for a period of ten years from the date of\n      completion of sentence, probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n\n            D. For the purposes of this Section, \u201cfirearm\u201d means any pistol,\n      revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, submachine gun, black powder\n      weapon, or assault rifle which is designed to fire or is capable of firing\n      fixed cartridge ammunition or from which a shot or projectile is\n      discharged by an explosive.\n\n      Subsequent to the 2012 amendment of LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11, this court\n\nconsidered the constitutionality of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 in State v. Draughter, 2013-\n\n0914 (La. 12/10/13), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and the constitutionality challenge to LSA-\n\nR.S. 14:95.1 was rejected in the limited circumstances presented in that case, i.e.,\n\nvis-\u00e0-vis a defendant who had been released from the physical custody of the State,\n\nbut who continued to be subject to State supervision, on active probation, for his\n\n                                          6\n\fprior conviction. We held that the State has a compelling interest in regulating\n\nconvicted felons still under the State\u2019s supervision, and LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. This court concluded that LSA-R.S.\n\n14:95.1 survives strict scrutiny and was not an unconstitutional infringement of\n\nDraughter\u2019s right to bear arms, pursuant to Article I, Section 11, as applied to the\n\nnarrow fact situation presented in that case. This court\u2019s conclusion in State v.\n\nDraughter was easily reached given that the defendant was still under State\n\nsupervision and was serving the probation portion of his criminal sentence, which\n\nnecessarily involved an intrusion into the defendant\u2019s life by the State officials\n\nadministering the supervision required by his status. The possession of a firearm\n\nby such a defendant was found to be inconsistent with that status and would\n\nsubject the individuals tasked with his supervision to an untenable safety risk. We\n\ndeclined to address the \u201clarger question\u201d of whether the State may dispossess\n\ncertain convicted felons of their right to bear arms for a number of years, even after\n\nthey have paid their debt to society and fully discharged their sentences, having\n\ndetermined that precise question was not before the court.             See State v.\n\nDraughter, 130 So.3d at 866-68.\n\n      Since deciding State v. Draughter, we have examined the 2012 amendment\n\nto LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 in State in the Interest of J.M. (with respect to LSA-\n\nR.S. 14:95(A), making illegal the carrying of an intentionally concealed firearm on\n\none\u2019s person, and LSA-R.S. 14:95.8, making unlawful the possession of a handgun\n\nby a person under the age of seventeen except in certain enumerated\n\ncircumstances), and in State v. Webb (with respect to LSA-R.S. 14:95(E), making\n\nunlawful the possession of a firearm while in the possession of or during the sale or\n\ndistribution of a controlled dangerous substance). In both State in the Interest of\n\nJ.M. and State v. Webb, this court upheld the challenged statutes against the\n\ndefendants\u2019 claims that these statutes unconstitutionality violated LSA-Const. art.\n\n                                          7\n\fI, \u00a7 11, concluding that each of the challenged statutes was enacted pursuant to\n\ncompelling government interests and that each was narrowly tailored to achieve\n\nlegitimate government purposes.\n\n       While the status of the defendants in the instant consolidated cases differs\n\nfrom those at issue in State v. Draughter, in that the Draughter defendants were\n\nstill under State supervision at the time of their arrests and the instant defendants\n\nhad completed all aspects of their prior sentences and were no longer under State\n\nsupervision when they were arrested on subsequent offenses, we nevertheless\n\nuphold the validity of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.\n\n       We begin our analysis of the current LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11-based\n\nchallenges to LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 by pointing out that we recognized in Draughter\n\nthat the right to bear arms has always been considered fundamental. The 2012\n\namendment to LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 merely sought to ensure that the review\n\nstandard of an alleged infringement of this fundamental right was in keeping with\n\nthe refinements made to constitutional analysis that developed since our decision in\n\nState v. Amos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1775248\"><a href=\"/opinion/1775248/state-v-amos/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (La. 1977).3 See State v.

Rather, the strict scrutiny standard adopted by the voters is\n\n\u201cdesigned to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and\n\nsincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker\u201d for firearm\n\nregulation within the context of the fundamental right to keep and bear arms.

I, \u00a7 11, by\n\nSenate Bill No. 303 (later passed as 2012 La. Acts, No. 874), took place on the\n\nSenate floor, which is instructive on the issues before this court. 4 During the\n\nSenate discussion, the bill\u2019s sponsor, Senator Riser, answered questions about the\n\nmeaning and effect of the bill, raised by Senators Claitor, Thompson, Donahue,\n\nAppel, and Long. Senator Riser stated that the purpose of the act was to reinforce\n\nthe Second Amendment in Louisiana law, so that Louisiana would have the\n\nstrongest Second Amendment law in the nation should the amendment pass. The\n\naim of the legislature in amending LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 was described by\n\nSenator Riser as protecting the fundamental right of individuals to keep and bear\n\narms, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s narrow 5-to-4 majority opinions in District\n\nof Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago. However, when\n\nspecifically questioned about the effect the proposed act would have on existing\n\ngun laws, Senator Riser stated, \u201c[T]his [act] defines . . . how laws are judged . . . .\n\n[W]e roughly have close to forty gun laws right now and those laws will stay in\n\neffect.\u201d Senator Riser further stated, \u201cAny [weapon] law on the books right now is\n\non the books [and] they are going to stay there . . . . You\u2019ll have to follow the\n\ncurrent statute[s].\u201d From these discussions, we can conclude that, in passing Act\n\n874, the legislature did not intend to invalidate existing weapons laws.\n\n      As declared by this court in State v. Amos, it is beyond question that the\n\nstatute challenged in the instant case, LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, was passed in the interest\n\nof the public and as an exercise of the police power vested in the legislature. Its\n\npurpose is to limit the possession of firearms by persons who, by their past\n\ncommission of certain specified serious felonies, have demonstrated a dangerous\n\n\n\n\n4\n  The recorded April 9, 2012 Senate discussion is archived on the Louisiana Senate website\n(http://senate.la.gov/sessioninfo/Archives/2012/rs.htm at 01:57:44).\n\n                                           10\n\fdisregard for the law and present a potential threat of further or future criminal\n\nactivity. State v. Amos, 343 So.2d at 168.\n\n       State v. Amos further acknowledged that LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is addressed to\n\npersons who are citizens of this State by virtue of the termination of state or federal\n\nsupervision following their convictions, pursuant to LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 20.5\n\nThese persons have previously been convicted of serious criminal offenses, and\n\nrestoration of citizenship cannot erase this fact.              The State v. Amos opinion\n\nrecognized that the verbatim transcripts of the constitutional convention debates\n\nindicated that neither LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 11 nor LSA-Const. art. I, \u00a7 20 were ever\n\nintended to preclude the type of legislation disputed herein. We are satisfied that it\n\nis reasonable for the legislature in the interest of public welfare and safety to\n\nregulate the possession of firearms, for a limited period of time, by citizens who\n\nhave committed certain specified serious felonies. Courts of other states having\n\nstatutes and constitutional provisions comparable to our own have similarly\n\nconcluded that such regulation is constitutionally permissible as a reasonable and\n\nlegitimate exercise of police power. See State v. Amos, 343 So.2d at 168. We\n\nconclude that the precepts set forth in State v. Amos continue to be valid and\n\napplicable today.\n\n       We also note that in District of Columbia v. Heller the Supreme Court, in\n\nevaluating the analogous Second Amendment right to bear arms, stated that\n\n\u201cnothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions\n\non the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the\n\ncarrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings,\n\n\n5\n  Article I, Section 20 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cFull rights of citizenship shall be restored\nupon termination of state and federal supervision following conviction for any offense.\u201d\nNevertheless, this court held in State v.

See State v. Amos, 343 So.2d at 168. Further, the law is\n\nnarrowly tailored in its application to the possession of firearms or the carrying of\n\nconcealed weapons for a period of only ten years from the date of completion of\n\nsentence, probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, and to only those convicted\n\nof the enumerated felonies determined by the legislature to be offenses having the\n\nactual or potential danger of harm to other members of the general public.6 Under\n\nthese circumstances, we find \u201ca long history, a substantial consensus, and simple\n\ncommon sense\u201d to be sufficient evidence for even a strict scrutiny review.

No such showing can be made\n\nin the instant case; as seen in State v. Draughter, circumstances clearly exist\n\nwhere LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is valid. Therefore, we find no merit in the defendants\u2019\n\nfacial challenge to LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.\n\n      We also reject the defendants\u2019 argument that LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is\n\nunconstitutional as applied to their individual circumstances.\n\n      Each of the three defendants reoffended within a relatively short period of\n\ntime following the completion of previously imposed State supervision. Stevens\n\nwas released from State supervision on his prior conviction for possession of\n\nmarijuana on May 18, 2011, and he was charged with committing a violation of\n\nLSA-R.S. 14:95.1 on June 8, 2011, only three weeks later. Eberhardt was released\n\nfrom State supervision on his prior conviction of unauthorized entry of an\n\ninhabited dwelling on May 30, 2010, and he was charged with committing a\n\nviolation of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 on June 27, 2012, approximately two years later\n\n                                         13\n\f(though we note that the third count of the indictment against Eberhardt charged\n\nhim with cyberstalking, which had allegedly commenced on or about November 7,\n\n2010, only twenty-three weeks after completion of his prior State supervision).\n\nTaylor completed his prior federal sentence for possession of cocaine and was\n\nreleased from federal supervision on June 1, 2007, and he was charged with\n\ncommitting a violation of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 on June 21, 2011, approximately four\n\nyears later.\n\n       These three defendants illustrate, rather than show exceptions to, the\n\nprinciples underlying felon-in-possession laws such as LSA-R.S. 14:95.1, i.e., that\n\ncertain convicted felons have demonstrated a dangerous disregard for the law and\n\npresent a potential threat of further or future criminal activity and are more likely\n\nthan nonfelons to engage in illegal and violent gun use. These cases demonstrate\n\nthat convicted felons are not only at risk to reoffend, but are at risk to reoffend\n\nusing firearms.\n\n       In the case of Taylor and Stevens, a firearm was used in the second degree\n\nmurder for which they are charged as co-defendants in this case. This is exactly\n\nthe type of offense LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 was enacted to prevent.\n\n       In Eberhardt\u2019s case, his weapon possession offense does not appear to be\n\nconnected to his other charged offenses of cyberstalking and theft. Eberhardt\n\nfurther suggests that his prior offense of unauthorized entry of an inhabited\n\ndwelling had no connection to possession of a firearm and that, therefore, as\n\napplied to his circumstances, LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is not narrowly tailored to ensure\n\npublic safety. We find no merit in Eberhardt\u2019s argument. While Eberhardt might\n\nnot have armed himself before committing unauthorized entry of an inhabited\n\ndwelling, the entry by an unauthorized person into the residence of another\n\npresents a situation of potential harm to the occupant who may resist the intrusion,\n\nin that the offender may nevertheless acquire a weapon on the premises and use it\n\n                                         14\n\fto cause harm to others. Moreover, some inhabited dwelling offenders go on to\n\nreoffend with a weapon. See State v. Wiggins, 2013-0649 (La. App. 1 Cir.\n\n1/31/14), ___ So.3d ___ (wherein the defendant was previously convicted of\n\nsimple burglary of an inhabited dwelling and subsequently reoffended with a\n\nfirearm and attempted to kill his victim); State v. Shepherd, 2008-1556 (La. App.\n\n3 Cir. 6/3/09), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1612233\"><a href=\"/opinion/1612233/state-v-shepherd/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (wherein the defendant entered the residence of the\n\nvictim, without authorization, and then armed himself with the victim\u2019s weapon\n\nand shot the victim in the chest). We do not find as applied over-inclusiveness in\n\nEberhardt\u2019s case. The offense of unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling\n\ncarries such a high potential for harm to innocent bystanders that its inclusion by\n\nthe legislature within the ambit of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1 is clearly warranted.\n\nFurthermore, it is impossible for the legislature to predict with complete certainty\n\nwhich offenders will reoffend with a firearm, and including those offenses that\n\ndemonstrate a serious disregard for the safety of others within LSA-R.S. 14:95.1\u2019s\n\nfelon-in-possession prohibition is appropriate given the compelling state interest in\n\nprotecting the public.7\n\n\n\n7\n  Eberhardt also cites the first offender pardon he received from the Department of Public Safety\nand Corrections (\u201cDPSC\u201d) after completing his probation; the June 24, 2010 DPSC notice stated\nthat Eberhardt had completed his sentence for unauthorized entry of an inhabited dwelling and\nhad met all of the requirements for an automatic first offender pardon, under LSA-R.S.\n15:572(D), and further stated: \u201c[A]s provided by Article 1, Section 20, and Article 4, Section\n5(E)(1), of the Louisiana Constitution, this will certify that effective May 30, 2010,\nCHRISTOPHER EBERHARDT has discharged his/her sentence for the above stated offense(s)\nand that all rights of citizenship and franchise are restored in Louisiana.\u201d However, the\n\u201cverification of first offender pardon\u201d received by Eberhardt also notified him that \u201c[t]he right to\nreceive, possess or transport a firearm may not be restored unless all legal provisions are met and\nshould be determined through the local law enforcement agency.\u201d At the time the June 24, 2010\nnotice was sent to Eberhardt, LSA-R.S. 14:95.1(C) provided that, in addition to the ten-year\ncleansing period, a convicted felon who had completed his sentence, probation, parole, or\nsuspension of sentence could apply to the sheriff of the parish in which he resided for a permit to\npossess a firearm; this discretionary sheriff\u2019s permit procedure was repealed by the Louisiana\nLegislature by 2010 La. Acts, No. 942, \u00a7 1, effective August 1, 2010. There is no indication that\nEberhardt applied for a sheriff\u2019s permit to possess a firearm between his date of eligibility, May\n30, 2010, and the date that the repeal of the sheriff\u2019s permit provision became effective, August\n1, 2010. In the absence of such a permit, the restoration of citizenship rights accorded by an\nLSA-R.S. 15:572(D) automatic pardon to first offenders does not exempt such an offender from\nthe application of LSA-R.S. 14:95.1.
