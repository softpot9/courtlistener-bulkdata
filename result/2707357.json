Coulson, Lake County Prosecutor and Joshua S. Horacek, Assistant\nProsecutor, Lake County Administration Building, 105 Main Street, P.O. Box 490,\nPainesville, OH 44077 (For Respondent).\n\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n        {\u00b61}     Before this court is relator, Emmanuel Elder\u2019s, Petition for a Writ of\n\nMandamus. Respondent, the State of Ohio/assistant prosecutor Patrick Condon, has\n\nfiled a Motion to Dismiss, pursuant to Ohio Civ.R. 12(B)(6), claiming that relator has\n\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and raising various other\n\nprocedural defects warranting dismissal.            For the following reasons, respondent\u2019s\n\nMotion has merit and, accordingly, relator\u2019s Petition is dismissed.\n\f       {\u00b62}   On November 8, 2013, relator filed his Petition for a Writ of Mandamus. In\n\nhis Petition, he requests that this court issue a writ of mandamus, ordering \u201cthe state\n\nand trial judge\u201d to \u201crespond\u201d to his Motion to Arrest the Judgment and his Motion for a\n\nNew Trial, filed in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas.\n\n       {\u00b63}   Respondent filed a Motion to Dismiss on December 11, 2013, asserting\n\nthat the Petition is improperly captioned, does not comply with the affidavit requirements\n\nof R.C. 2969.25(A), and that Condon has no legal duty to respond to motions filed by\n\nrelator.\n\n       {\u00b64}   As an initial matter, there are several procedural deficiencies in relator\u2019s\n\nPetition. Pursuant to R.C. 2731.04, an \u201c[a]pplication for the writ of mandamus must be\n\nby petition, in the name of the state on the relation of the person applying, and verified\n\nby affidavit.\u201d The caption of relator\u2019s petition does not indicate that the request is made\n\nin the name of the state on the relation of Elder. Instead, the petition was filed by Elder\n\nin his individual capacity. Moreover, the caption improperly lists the respondent first, in\n\nthe position of the relator. Respondent has alerted relator of his failure to properly\n\ncaption the mandamus action by way of the Motion to Dismiss, but relator did not seek\n\nleave to amend the complaint to comply with the requirements of R.C. 2731.04. \u201cThe\n\nfailure to caption an original action properly constitutes sufficient grounds for dismissing\n\nthe petition.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Snype v. Enlow, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2011-P-0096,\n\n2012-Ohio-1272, \u00b6 4; Hill v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2011-T-0094, 2011-Ohio-\n\n6341, \u00b6 4 and 7, citing Maloney v. Court of Common Pleas of Allen Cty., 173 Ohio St.\n\n226, 227, 181 N.E.2d 270 (1962). Thus, dismissal is warranted on this ground alone.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       {\u00b65}    Additionally, pursuant to Civ.R. 10(A), the caption of a complaint must\n\n\u201cinclude the names and addresses of all the parties,\u201d and failure to include such a\n\ncaption in an original action also constitutes grounds for dismissal. Snype at \u00b6 7; Hill at\n\n\u00b6 8. Here, relator has failed to include the addresses of any of the parties in the caption\n\nof his Petition.\n\n       {\u00b66}    Relator, who is presently incarcerated, also failed to comply with the\n\naffidavit requirement under R.C. 2969.25. \u201cAt the time that an inmate commences a\n\ncivil action or appeal against a government entity or employee, the inmate shall file with\n\nthe court an affidavit that contains a description of each action or appeal of a civil action\n\nthat the inmate has filed in the previous five years in any state or federal court.\u201d R.C.\n\n2969.25(A). Failure to attach such a document to a request for a writ of mandamus\n\nwarrants dismissal, since the requirements of R.C. 2969.25 are mandatory. State ex\n\nrel. Hill v. Logan, 11th Dist.

State ex rel. Sanders v. Enlow, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010-P-0022,\n\n2010- Ohio-5053, \u00b6 14.

See State v. Sklenar, 71 Ohio App.3d\n\n444, 446, 594 N.E.2d 88 (9th Dist.1991) (an appellant cannot compel the prosecutor to\n\nrespond to his postconviction petition).\n\n       {\u00b68}   We note that relator alleges in the body of his petition that the \u201ctrial court,\u201d\n\ni.e., Judge Richard Collins, Jr., also failed to \u201crespond\u201d to his motions.        He further\n\nasserts that Judge Collins issued an October 22, 2013 Judgment Entry, staying action\n\non his motions pending appeal, that was unsupported by law. However, relator did not\n\nbring the present action against Judge Collins, since he failed to identify him in the\n\ncaption as a respondent. A petition is \u201cfatally deficient\u201d and dismissal is warranted when\n\nit fails to properly identify the respondent. State ex rel. Sherrills v. State, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 78261, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 3510, 3 (Aug. 3, 2000) (where the body of\n\nthe petition sought relief from certain individuals but they were not identified in the\n\ncaption as respondents, the petition in mandamus must be dismissed since, \u201c[w]ithout\n\nproperly identifying the respondent it is impossible to determine whether or not there are\n\nrights and duties enforceable in mandamus\u201d); State ex rel.

He further\n\nasserts that Judge Collins issued an October 22, 2013 Judgment Entry, staying action\n\non his motions pending appeal, that was unsupported by law. However, relator did not\n\nbring the present action against Judge Collins, since he failed to identify him in the\n\ncaption as a respondent. A petition is \u201cfatally deficient\u201d and dismissal is warranted when\n\nit fails to properly identify the respondent. State ex rel. Sherrills v. State, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 78261, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 3510, 3 (Aug. 3, 2000) (where the body of\n\nthe petition sought relief from certain individuals but they were not identified in the\n\ncaption as respondents, the petition in mandamus must be dismissed since, \u201c[w]ithout\n\nproperly identifying the respondent it is impossible to determine whether or not there are\n\nrights and duties enforceable in mandamus\u201d); State ex rel. Jackson v. Lucas Cty., 6th\n\nDist. Lucas No. L-96-049, 1996 Ohio App. LEXIS 1138, 3 (Mar. 5, 1996) (\u201c[t]his court\n\ncannot direct a writ of mandamus to an unidentified respondent\u201d).\n\n       {\u00b69}   For the foregoing reasons, respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss is granted. It is\n\nthe order of this court that relator\u2019s Petition for Writ of Mandamus is dismissed.\n\n\nDIANE V. GRENDELL, J., THOMAS R.
