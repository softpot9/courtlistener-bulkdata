The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge\n\nissues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2012). A certificate of\n\nappealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\n\nright.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2012). When the district court denies relief on the\n\nmerits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would\n\nfind that the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims is debatable or wrong.\n\nSlack v.
