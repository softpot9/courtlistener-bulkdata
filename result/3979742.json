Vernon's Comp. Tex. Stats. 1920, Arts. 7696-97; Vernon's Ann. Tex. Stats. (Civ.), Vol. 20, Art. 7340; Vernon's Ann. Tex. Stats.

Munzensheimer,.\n\nThe issue presented calls for a construction of the Acts of the 3rd Called Session of the Thirty-Sixth Legislature (1920), page 103. Prior to the time that act of the Legislature went into effect Arts. 7696 and 7697, Vernon's Complete Tex. Stats., 1920, controlled.\n\nIt will be seen that up to the enactment during the 3rd Called Session of the Thirty-Sixth Legislature of our present Statute, Art. 7340, taking place of the two old Arts. 7696 and 7697, one amount was required to be paid by the owner of the land in order to redeem from a purchaser other than the State or a city or town and a different amount was required to redeem from the State or a city or town as a purchaser. The Act of 1920 seems to be a re-enactment of old Art. 7697, without re-enacting Art. 7696, and expressly repealing all laws in conflict with said act.\n\nThe compilers of the new statutes entirely omitted Art. 7696 of the old Statutes from their compilation, evidently taking the view that it had been repealed by the 1920 Act or repealed or nullified by the Acts of 1923, 2nd and 3rd Called Sessions.\n\n Huson  Huson  and  Guy E. Bonham,  for appellees.\n\nWe believe that the saving clause in the 1925 Statutes is plain and unambiguous and disposes of both questions certified without necessity for further argument.\n\nIn justice to the Court of Civil Appeals, we will state that this provision of the statute was not called to its attention by either party until after the appellees' amended motion for rehearing had been filed.
