Martinez asserts the district court abused its discretion in\ngranting the State\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence that he consumed alcohol after driving,\nbut before his blood alcohol concentration was measured. The State argues the district court\nmade alternative holdings and because Martinez failed to address one of the district court\u2019s\nholdings, this Court should affirm on the uncontested basis.\n                                                 I.\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       A witness called 911 to report Martinez speeding and running stop signs. The witness\nfollowed Martinez to a trailer court, but upon entering the trailer court, the witness lost sight of\nMartinez\u2019s vehicle. The witness was able to follow skid marks to where Martinez\u2019s vehicle was\nparked in the front yard of a house in the trailer court. Martinez exited the driver\u2019s side of the\n\n                                                 1\n\fvehicle and started yelling at the witness. The witness, still in his vehicle, started to drive away\nand Martinez went inside the house for approximately one minute. As Martinez re-emerged\nfrom the house, an officer arrived and witnessed Martinez throw a non-alcoholic energy drink at\nthe witness\u2019s vehicle. The officer arrested Martinez.\n          After the officer read Martinez his Miranda 1 rights, Martinez refused to speak to the\nofficer without an attorney present. The officer suspected Martinez was intoxicated because\nMartinez smelled of alcohol, his speech was slurred, and his eyes were glassy and bloodshot.\nWhen Martinez refused to take a breathalyzer test, the officer transported Martinez to jail and\nobtained a warrant for a blood sample. The blood draw occurred approximately two hours after\nthe officer arrived at Martinez\u2019s house and revealed Martinez\u2019s blood alcohol level was .237.\nMartinez was charged with felony driving under the influence, second excessive within five\nyears, Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-8004C(2), -8005, and driving without a valid driver\u2019s license, I.C. \u00a7 49-\n301(1).\n          The State filed a motion in limine to exclude testimony that Martinez consumed alcohol\nafter he had been driving, but before he was arrested, and that this alleged alcohol consumption\naffected the results of his blood alcohol content. The district court granted the State\u2019s motion in\nlimine and made two alternative rulings. Relying on State v. Tomlinson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ct. App. 2015), the district court first held:\n          So where the State is proceeding solely on the per se theory, the holding, I\n          believe, in Tomlinson is consistent that the State can proceed on the blood test\n          solely. And the relevant standard is simply the alcohol concentration as shown by\n          an approved, properly-administered test of the driver\u2019s breath, blood or urine. As\n          such, any testimony or evidence that the defendant had consumed alcohol\n          between the driving and the administration of the test, I think, is not relevant.\n          And any testimony relating to the inadequacies of the test would require expert\n          testimony.\nMartinez\u2019s counsel asked the district court: \u201cI guess, Judge, if you could clarify for me so I\nknow how to counsel him as far as--so you\u2019re saying, even if we had all the expert testimony in\nthe world prepared, his testimony that he consumed alcohol subsequent to driving would not be\nallowed under Tomlinson?\u201d The district court stated: \u201cUnder Tomlinson, the--what the State is\nrequired to prove is the alcohol concentration at the time the test was taken. And that is\nconclusive, not presumptive on the per se theory. That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s Tomlinson.\u201d\n\n\n1\n          See Miranda v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966).\n                                                  2\n\f       Martinez\u2019s counsel then asked the district court to clarify its ruling, asking:\n       If the Court\u2019s saying you would allow Mr. Martinez to testify about intervening\n       drinking if we had an expert, I would ask for a continuance to get that expert,\n       especially given the reason this was first continued, that the State just didn\u2019t know\n       about one of the officers being on vacation or something. So this has been\n       continued one time. I get the last time I asked for a continuance, \u2018cause it was the\n       day following a two-day trial I had with Your Honor. If that\u2019s the Court\u2019s ruling,\n       that he would be allowed to testify about intervening consumption with the--with\n       the appropriate expert, then I would ask for that continuance.\n       The district court made a second ruling when it responded:\n               Well, my ruling is he could present testimony and evidence as to such\n       intervening drinking. But in order for that to have any relevance whatsoever,\n       there has to be expert testimony. So I\u2019m not going to preclude what he wants to\n       offer as evidence, but you\u2019re not going to argue or, you know, this intervening\n       drinking as blood alcohol level would have been lower. There\u2019s--unless you have\n       an expert to support that.\n(Emphasis added). Martinez moved for a continuance, which the district court denied. Martinez\nentered a conditional guilty plea to the charge of felony driving under the influence, second with\nan excessive blood alcohol concentration within five years, reserving his right to appeal the\ndistrict court\u2019s order granting the State\u2019s motion in limine. The State dismissed the charge of\ndriving without a valid driver\u2019s license. The district court sentenced Martinez to a unified five-\nyear sentence, with two years determinate, and retained jurisdiction. Martinez timely appeals.\n                                                 II.\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       When a trial court\u2019s discretionary decision is reviewed on appeal, the appellate court\nconducts a multi-tiered inquiry to determine whether the lower court correctly perceived the\nissue as one of discretion, acted within the boundaries of such discretion and consistently with\nany legal standards applicable to the specific choices before it, and reached its decision by an\nexercise of reason.

The State\nargues because Martinez did not challenge the district court\u2019s alternative holding that Martinez\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fcould present testimony and evidence of intervening drinking if he presented expert testimony,\nthe district court\u2019s decision must be affirmed on this uncontested basis.\nA.     Martinez Has Failed to Establish a Justiciable Controversy Regarding His\n       Consumption of Alcohol After Driving, But Before He Was Arrested\n        Martinez did not present any evidence to the district court that Martinez drank alcohol\nafter driving, but before the administration of the blood test. 2 As a result, the issue Martinez asks\nthis Court to address relies on a hypothetical fact--that Martinez may have consumed alcohol\nafter driving, but before the administration of the blood test. As a result, there is no justiciable\ncontroversy. This Court has explained that a justiciable controversy is:\n       distinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character;\n       from one that is academic or moot. . . . The controversy must be definite and\n       concrete, touching the legal relations of the parties having adverse legal\n       interests. . . . It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific\n       relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion\n       advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\nState v.

This Court also\nhas a duty to raise the issues of mootness sua sponte. In re Doe I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874459\"><a href=\"/opinion/874459/doe-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (2008).\n       In the case at bar, during the preliminary hearing, the officer testified that he observed\nMartinez with a non-alcoholic energy drink and that Martinez refused to speak to the officer\nwithout an attorney present. The witness testified Martinez was in his home for approximately\none minute. Martinez did not testify at the preliminary hearing.\n       On the morning of trial, the district court addressed the State\u2019s motion in limine to\nexclude testimony and evidence that Martinez consumed alcohol after he had been driving, but\nbefore he was arrested, and that this alleged alcohol consumption affected the results of his blood\n2\n        During Martinez\u2019s interview as part of the presentence investigation report, Martinez\nreported that after he went into his house, he drank more alcohol, and then went outside to smoke\na cigarette. To the extent this statement qualifies as evidence, it was not presented to the district\ncourt at the motion in limine hearing. Thus, at the time the district court ruled on the motion in\nlimine, no evidence was presented to establish Martinez consumed alcohol between the time\nMartinez entered the house and the time he was arrested.\n                                                  4\n\falcohol content.   The State attempted to alert Martinez to the lack of evidence regarding\nMartinez\u2019s intermediate drinking and stated: \u201cMy only concern, Your Honor, and this is really\n[defense counsel\u2019s] problem and not mine, is that factual record has not been developed\nsufficiently for an appeal.\u201d In response to the State\u2019s comment, Martinez\u2019s counsel quoted from\nthe preliminary hearing transcript and stated:\n       \u201cJudge, my\u201d--this is me reading the transcript. \u201cJudge, my response is, as far as\n       we know, he never saw--there\u2019s a lapse of time when Mr. Martinez might have\n       been inside the house consuming alcohol. And so that alcohol might be what\n       caused this to be excessive.\u201d\n                So I\u2019m just curious, the time frame from when he saw him--I\u2019m trying to\n       get the time frame when he might have been inside the house drinking to when\n       the blood was drawn. Really, the argument--I guess I could make an offer of\n       proof, but it\u2019s always been these people--the State\u2019s witnesses followed him.\n       They called in 911. They follow him, get to his house. At prelim, the gentleman\n       testified he saw my guy get out of the driver\u2019s seat, go inside the house, later on\n       come out with a Red Bull can and throw it at them. There\u2019s the malicious injury\n       to property. So there\u2019s that time that\u2019s always been--there\u2019s a time when you\n       were out of view of any witness whatsoever, and there was alleged consumption\n       of alcohol during that time. And no subsequent driving.\n       Thus, rather than make an offer of proof even though defense counsel had been alerted\nthere was an insufficient factual record to support his argument, defense counsel declined to\nprovide any evidence on the factual issue. As a result, the issue is not properly before this Court\nand we decline to address the issue.\nB.     We Need Not Address Martinez\u2019s Claim on Appeal Because Martinez Does Not\n       Contest the District Court\u2019s Alternative Holding\n       Even if Martinez preserved the above issue, Martinez does not contest the district court\u2019s\nalternative holding. \u201cWhere a lower court makes a ruling based on two alternative grounds and\nonly one of those grounds is challenged on appeal, the appellate court must affirm on the\nuncontested basis.\u201d Morrison v. St. Luke\u2019s Regional Medical Center, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 609,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1062</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1072 (2016) (quoting State v. Grazian, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517-18, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874903\"><a href=\"/opinion/874903/state-v-grazian/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n797-98 (2007)).\n       As stated above, the district court based its decision on two alternative grounds: (1) that\ntestimony or evidence of Martinez\u2019s consumption of alcohol between driving and the\nadministration of the blood alcohol test was not relevant; and (2) that testimony or evidence that\nconsumption of alcohol after driving affected the results of Martinez\u2019s blood alcohol test was\nrelevant only if Martinez presented expert testimony. In his opening brief, Martinez challenged\n\n                                                 5\n\fthe district court\u2019s holding that the evidence of drinking after driving was not relevant; Martinez\ndid not challenge the district court\u2019s alternative holding that evidence of drinking after driving\nwas relevant if an expert witness testified. In his reply brief, Martinez argued there was no\nalternative holding because \u201cthe parties appeared to believe that, in stating it would permit some\nexpert testimony, the district court was referring to expert testimony challenging the\nadministration of the test itself, as it had referred to earlier in its ruling.\u201d\n        However, a careful reading of the district court\u2019s statement indicates otherwise. The\ndistrict court stated:\n                Well, my ruling is he could present testimony and evidence as to such\n        intervening drinking. But in order for that to have any relevance whatsoever,\n        there has to be expert testimony. So I\u2019m not going to preclude what he wants to\n        offer as evidence, but you\u2019re not going to argue or, you know, this intervening\n        drinking as blood alcohol level would have been lower. There\u2019s--unless you have\n        an expert to support that.\n(Emphasis added). The district court\u2019s statement regarding the admissibility of evidence as long\nas there was expert testimony is contrary to the ruling the district court previously made when\ngranting the motion in limine; as such, it constitutes a different and alternate ground for\nexcluding the evidence.       The district court\u2019s first ruling indicated that when the State is\nproceeding under a per se theory of driving under the influence, the defendant\u2019s consumption of\nalcohol between driving and the administration of the blood alcohol test is not relevant and any\ntestimony relating to the inadequacies of the test would require expert testimony. The district\ncourt\u2019s second ruling indicated the expert testimony was to support an argument that drinking\nafter driving affected Martinez\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of the test, not that the\nadministration of the test was faulty. Because Martinez did not challenge the district court\u2019s\nalternative ruling, we affirm the district court on the uncontested basis. 3\n                                                    IV.\n                                            CONCLUSION\n        Because Martinez failed to establish justiciable controversy regarding the issue of\nwhether evidence of Martinez\u2019s drinking after driving, but before a blood alcohol test, is relevant\nto the charge of driving under the influence and because Martinez does not challenge the district\n\n\n\n3\n       We do not address the district court\u2019s denial of Martinez\u2019s motion for a continuance\nbecause Martinez does not raise this as an issue on appeal.\n                                                     6\n\fcourt\u2019s alternative holding, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the State\u2019s motion in\nlimine and judgment of conviction.\n       Chief Judge GRATTON and Judge MELANSON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f</pre>", "Case_Text": "               IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF IDAHO\n\n                                        Docket No. 44399\n\nSTATE OF IDAHO,                                  )    2017 Unpublished Opinion No. 458\n                                                 )\n       Plaintiff-Respondent,                     )    Filed: May 3, 2017\n                                                 )\nv.                                               )    Stephen W.

Jorgensen, Deputy\n       Attorney General, Boise, for respondent.\n                 ________________________________________________\n\nHUSKEY, Judge\n       Juan Ortega Martinez, Jr. appeals from his judgment of conviction for felony driving\nunder the influence of alcohol.     Martinez asserts the district court abused its discretion in\ngranting the State\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence that he consumed alcohol after driving,\nbut before his blood alcohol concentration was measured. The State argues the district court\nmade alternative holdings and because Martinez failed to address one of the district court\u2019s\nholdings, this Court should affirm on the uncontested basis.\n                                                 I.\n                     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       A witness called 911 to report Martinez speeding and running stop signs. The witness\nfollowed Martinez to a trailer court, but upon entering the trailer court, the witness lost sight of\nMartinez\u2019s vehicle. The witness was able to follow skid marks to where Martinez\u2019s vehicle was\nparked in the front yard of a house in the trailer court. Martinez exited the driver\u2019s side of the\n\n                                                 1\n\fvehicle and started yelling at the witness. The witness, still in his vehicle, started to drive away\nand Martinez went inside the house for approximately one minute. As Martinez re-emerged\nfrom the house, an officer arrived and witnessed Martinez throw a non-alcoholic energy drink at\nthe witness\u2019s vehicle. The officer arrested Martinez.\n          After the officer read Martinez his Miranda 1 rights, Martinez refused to speak to the\nofficer without an attorney present. The officer suspected Martinez was intoxicated because\nMartinez smelled of alcohol, his speech was slurred, and his eyes were glassy and bloodshot.\nWhen Martinez refused to take a breathalyzer test, the officer transported Martinez to jail and\nobtained a warrant for a blood sample. The blood draw occurred approximately two hours after\nthe officer arrived at Martinez\u2019s house and revealed Martinez\u2019s blood alcohol level was .237.\nMartinez was charged with felony driving under the influence, second excessive within five\nyears, Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 18-8004C(2), -8005, and driving without a valid driver\u2019s license, I.C. \u00a7 49-\n301(1).\n          The State filed a motion in limine to exclude testimony that Martinez consumed alcohol\nafter he had been driving, but before he was arrested, and that this alleged alcohol consumption\naffected the results of his blood alcohol content. The district court granted the State\u2019s motion in\nlimine and made two alternative rulings. Relying on State v. Tomlinson, 159 Idaho 112, 357\nP.3d 238 (Ct. App. 2015), the district court first held:\n          So where the State is proceeding solely on the per se theory, the holding, I\n          believe, in Tomlinson is consistent that the State can proceed on the blood test\n          solely. And the relevant standard is simply the alcohol concentration as shown by\n          an approved, properly-administered test of the driver\u2019s breath, blood or urine. As\n          such, any testimony or evidence that the defendant had consumed alcohol\n          between the driving and the administration of the test, I think, is not relevant.\n          And any testimony relating to the inadequacies of the test would require expert\n          testimony.\nMartinez\u2019s counsel asked the district court: \u201cI guess, Judge, if you could clarify for me so I\nknow how to counsel him as far as--so you\u2019re saying, even if we had all the expert testimony in\nthe world prepared, his testimony that he consumed alcohol subsequent to driving would not be\nallowed under Tomlinson?\u201d The district court stated: \u201cUnder Tomlinson, the--what the State is\nrequired to prove is the alcohol concentration at the time the test was taken. And that is\nconclusive, not presumptive on the per se theory. That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s Tomlinson.\u201d\n\n\n1\n          See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n                                                  2\n\f       Martinez\u2019s counsel then asked the district court to clarify its ruling, asking:\n       If the Court\u2019s saying you would allow Mr. Martinez to testify about intervening\n       drinking if we had an expert, I would ask for a continuance to get that expert,\n       especially given the reason this was first continued, that the State just didn\u2019t know\n       about one of the officers being on vacation or something. So this has been\n       continued one time. I get the last time I asked for a continuance, \u2018cause it was the\n       day following a two-day trial I had with Your Honor. If that\u2019s the Court\u2019s ruling,\n       that he would be allowed to testify about intervening consumption with the--with\n       the appropriate expert, then I would ask for that continuance.\n       The district court made a second ruling when it responded:\n               Well, my ruling is he could present testimony and evidence as to such\n       intervening drinking. But in order for that to have any relevance whatsoever,\n       there has to be expert testimony. So I\u2019m not going to preclude what he wants to\n       offer as evidence, but you\u2019re not going to argue or, you know, this intervening\n       drinking as blood alcohol level would have been lower. There\u2019s--unless you have\n       an expert to support that.\n(Emphasis added). Martinez moved for a continuance, which the district court denied. Martinez\nentered a conditional guilty plea to the charge of felony driving under the influence, second with\nan excessive blood alcohol concentration within five years, reserving his right to appeal the\ndistrict court\u2019s order granting the State\u2019s motion in limine. The State dismissed the charge of\ndriving without a valid driver\u2019s license. The district court sentenced Martinez to a unified five-\nyear sentence, with two years determinate, and retained jurisdiction. Martinez timely appeals.\n                                                 II.\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       When a trial court\u2019s discretionary decision is reviewed on appeal, the appellate court\nconducts a multi-tiered inquiry to determine whether the lower court correctly perceived the\nissue as one of discretion, acted within the boundaries of such discretion and consistently with\nany legal standards applicable to the specific choices before it, and reached its decision by an\nexercise of reason. State v. Hedger, 115 Idaho 598, 600, 768 P.2d 1331, 1333 (1989).\n                                                III.\n                                           ANALYSIS\n        Martinez argues the district court abused its discretion when it granted the State\u2019s motion\nin limine because evidence of consumption of alcohol after driving, but before the administration\nof a blood test, is relevant to whether Martinez was driving under the influence. The State\nargues because Martinez did not challenge the district court\u2019s alternative holding that Martinez\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fcould present testimony and evidence of intervening drinking if he presented expert testimony,\nthe district court\u2019s decision must be affirmed on this uncontested basis.\nA.     Martinez Has Failed to Establish a Justiciable Controversy Regarding His\n       Consumption of Alcohol After Driving, But Before He Was Arrested\n        Martinez did not present any evidence to the district court that Martinez drank alcohol\nafter driving, but before the administration of the blood test. 2 As a result, the issue Martinez asks\nthis Court to address relies on a hypothetical fact--that Martinez may have consumed alcohol\nafter driving, but before the administration of the blood test. As a result, there is no justiciable\ncontroversy. This Court has explained that a justiciable controversy is:\n       distinguished from a difference or dispute of a hypothetical or abstract character;\n       from one that is academic or moot. . . . The controversy must be definite and\n       concrete, touching the legal relations of the parties having adverse legal\n       interests. . . . It must be a real and substantial controversy admitting of specific\n       relief through a decree of a conclusive character, as distinguished from an opinion\n       advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\nState v. Philip Morris, Inc., 158 Idaho 874, 881, 354 P.3d 187, 194 (2015) (quoting Davidson v.\nWright, 143 Idaho 616, 620, 151 P.3d 812, 816 (2006)). And, with no justiciable controversy,\nthe issue is moot. An issue is moot if it \u201cdoes not present a real and substantial controversy that\nis capable of being concluded through judicial decree of specific relief.\u201d Ameritel Inns, Inc. v.\nGreater Boise Auditorium Dist., 141 Idaho 849, 851, 119 P.3d 624, 626 (2005). This Court also\nhas a duty to raise the issues of mootness sua sponte. In re Doe I, 145 Idaho 337, 340, 179 P.3d\n300, 303 (2008).\n       In the case at bar, during the preliminary hearing, the officer testified that he observed\nMartinez with a non-alcoholic energy drink and that Martinez refused to speak to the officer\nwithout an attorney present. The witness testified Martinez was in his home for approximately\none minute. Martinez did not testify at the preliminary hearing.\n       On the morning of trial, the district court addressed the State\u2019s motion in limine to\nexclude testimony and evidence that Martinez consumed alcohol after he had been driving, but\nbefore he was arrested, and that this alleged alcohol consumption affected the results of his blood\n2\n        During Martinez\u2019s interview as part of the presentence investigation report, Martinez\nreported that after he went into his house, he drank more alcohol, and then went outside to smoke\na cigarette. To the extent this statement qualifies as evidence, it was not presented to the district\ncourt at the motion in limine hearing. Thus, at the time the district court ruled on the motion in\nlimine, no evidence was presented to establish Martinez consumed alcohol between the time\nMartinez entered the house and the time he was arrested.\n                                                  4\n\falcohol content.   The State attempted to alert Martinez to the lack of evidence regarding\nMartinez\u2019s intermediate drinking and stated: \u201cMy only concern, Your Honor, and this is really\n[defense counsel\u2019s] problem and not mine, is that factual record has not been developed\nsufficiently for an appeal.\u201d In response to the State\u2019s comment, Martinez\u2019s counsel quoted from\nthe preliminary hearing transcript and stated:\n       \u201cJudge, my\u201d--this is me reading the transcript. \u201cJudge, my response is, as far as\n       we know, he never saw--there\u2019s a lapse of time when Mr. Martinez might have\n       been inside the house consuming alcohol. And so that alcohol might be what\n       caused this to be excessive.\u201d\n                So I\u2019m just curious, the time frame from when he saw him--I\u2019m trying to\n       get the time frame when he might have been inside the house drinking to when\n       the blood was drawn. Really, the argument--I guess I could make an offer of\n       proof, but it\u2019s always been these people--the State\u2019s witnesses followed him.\n       They called in 911. They follow him, get to his house. At prelim, the gentleman\n       testified he saw my guy get out of the driver\u2019s seat, go inside the house, later on\n       come out with a Red Bull can and throw it at them. There\u2019s the malicious injury\n       to property. So there\u2019s that time that\u2019s always been--there\u2019s a time when you\n       were out of view of any witness whatsoever, and there was alleged consumption\n       of alcohol during that time. And no subsequent driving.\n       Thus, rather than make an offer of proof even though defense counsel had been alerted\nthere was an insufficient factual record to support his argument, defense counsel declined to\nprovide any evidence on the factual issue. As a result, the issue is not properly before this Court\nand we decline to address the issue.\nB.     We Need Not Address Martinez\u2019s Claim on Appeal Because Martinez Does Not\n       Contest the District Court\u2019s Alternative Holding\n       Even if Martinez preserved the above issue, Martinez does not contest the district court\u2019s\nalternative holding. \u201cWhere a lower court makes a ruling based on two alternative grounds and\nonly one of those grounds is challenged on appeal, the appellate court must affirm on the\nuncontested basis.\u201d Morrison v. St. Luke\u2019s Regional Medical Center, Ltd., 160 Idaho 599, 609,\n377 P.3d 1062, 1072 (2016) (quoting State v. Grazian, 144 Idaho 510, 517-18, 164 P.3d 790,\n797-98 (2007)).\n       As stated above, the district court based its decision on two alternative grounds: (1) that\ntestimony or evidence of Martinez\u2019s consumption of alcohol between driving and the\nadministration of the blood alcohol test was not relevant; and (2) that testimony or evidence that\nconsumption of alcohol after driving affected the results of Martinez\u2019s blood alcohol test was\nrelevant only if Martinez presented expert testimony. In his opening brief, Martinez challenged\n\n                                                 5\n\fthe district court\u2019s holding that the evidence of drinking after driving was not relevant; Martinez\ndid not challenge the district court\u2019s alternative holding that evidence of drinking after driving\nwas relevant if an expert witness testified. In his reply brief, Martinez argued there was no\nalternative holding because \u201cthe parties appeared to believe that, in stating it would permit some\nexpert testimony, the district court was referring to expert testimony challenging the\nadministration of the test itself, as it had referred to earlier in its ruling.\u201d\n        However, a careful reading of the district court\u2019s statement indicates otherwise. The\ndistrict court stated:\n                Well, my ruling is he could present testimony and evidence as to such\n        intervening drinking. But in order for that to have any relevance whatsoever,\n        there has to be expert testimony. So I\u2019m not going to preclude what he wants to\n        offer as evidence, but you\u2019re not going to argue or, you know, this intervening\n        drinking as blood alcohol level would have been lower. There\u2019s--unless you have\n        an expert to support that.\n(Emphasis added). The district court\u2019s statement regarding the admissibility of evidence as long\nas there was expert testimony is contrary to the ruling the district court previously made when\ngranting the motion in limine; as such, it constitutes a different and alternate ground for\nexcluding the evidence.       The district court\u2019s first ruling indicated that when the State is\nproceeding under a per se theory of driving under the influence, the defendant\u2019s consumption of\nalcohol between driving and the administration of the blood alcohol test is not relevant and any\ntestimony relating to the inadequacies of the test would require expert testimony. The district\ncourt\u2019s second ruling indicated the expert testimony was to support an argument that drinking\nafter driving affected Martinez\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of the test, not that the\nadministration of the test was faulty. Because Martinez did not challenge the district court\u2019s\nalternative ruling, we affirm the district court on the uncontested basis. 3\n                                                    IV.\n                                            CONCLUSION\n        Because Martinez failed to establish justiciable controversy regarding the issue of\nwhether evidence of Martinez\u2019s drinking after driving, but before a blood alcohol test, is relevant\nto the charge of driving under the influence and because Martinez does not challenge the district\n\n\n\n3\n       We do not address the district court\u2019s denial of Martinez\u2019s motion for a continuance\nbecause Martinez does not raise this as an issue on appeal.\n                                                     6\n\fcourt\u2019s alternative holding, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting the State\u2019s motion in\nlimine and judgment of conviction.\n       Chief Judge GRATTON and Judge MELANSON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "66eafb8e3810c4af46c3434f350e72d825838c7e", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Idaho Court of Appeals", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/107252/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/874459/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/874903/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1175427/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2587659/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2638211/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2017-05-03T18:10:15.924648Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 7, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/4388593/state-v-juan-ortega-martinez-jr/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "4165846", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "State v.
