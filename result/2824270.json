Kihanya argues that the district court erred\n\nby admitting the girl\u2019s out-of-court statements and that without these statements, there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to convict him. He further argues that with respect to the\n\nsecond count, the evidence did not show that his contact with the victim was intentional.\n\nBecause the district court did not plainly err in admitting the evidence and because there\n\nwas sufficient evidence for the jury to find Kihanya guilty of both counts, we affirm.\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       At the time of the charged incidents, appellant Kihanya was living in Goodview,\n\nMinnesota, with his wife, their two children, and his wife\u2019s two children from a prior\n\nrelationship: a boy and a girl, A.E. During a visit with an uncle\u2019s family in North Dakota\n\nin July 2013, A.E. told a 12-year-old female cousin, H.N., that Kihanya touches her. A.E.\n\ntold H.N. not to tell anyone and ran to another room. H.N. asked A.E.\u2019s brother, who was\n\nalso visiting, whether he had seen any contact. He confirmed that he had. H.N. called her\n\nmother, S.N., at work. S.N. promptly returned home. A.E. initially told S.N. that no abuse\n\nhad occurred, but then started crying and told her that Kihanya had touched her. S.N.\n\nbrought A.E. to the local police station where they spoke with an investigator who\n\narranged for A.E. to interview with a specialist at Red River Children\u2019s Advocacy Center.\n\nHaving learned that A.E.\u2019s brother was a witness, police arranged for him to also be\n\ninterviewed at the center.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       The forensic interviewer at the Red River Center conducted a videotaped, one-\n\nhour conversation with A.E. A.E. told the interviewer that she was there because of \u201cwhat\n\n[her] stepdad does,\u201d and she wrote, \u201cHe touches me in places he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d She clarified\n\nthat she meant her \u201cprivates,\u201d which she uses to \u201cgo pee.\u201d She explained that Kihanya\n\nuses his finger, that it happens at home, and that he had done so several times, beginning\n\nwhen she was eight years old. The most recent contact occurred on an evening when the\n\nfamily was moving to another residence. A.E. said that she was sleeping on a couch and\n\nwoke to Kihanya standing next to her, moving his finger in her crotch under her clothes.\n\nA.E. also disclosed an incident that her brother had witnessed when Kihanya came up\n\nbehind her, \u201cgrab[bed]\u201d her privates over her clothes, and pulled her to him. A.E. said\n\nthat Kihanya told her not to tell anyone. She was afraid to tell her mother or grandmother\n\nabout Kihanya\u2019s conduct because she thought they would become angry. Further inquiry\n\nrevealed that A.E. had earlier told a friend, A.C., that Kihanya had been touching her\n\ninappropriately.\n\n       Kihanya was charged with two second-degree criminal sexual offenses under\n\nMinnesota Statutes section 609.343, subdivision 1(a) (2012). Count I addresses the couch\n\nincident; count II relates to the grabbing-from-behind incident.\n\n       Before trial, the state noted A.E.\u2019s difficulty discussing the abuse and informed\n\ndefense counsel that it intended to introduce A.E.\u2019s videotaped forensic interviews under\n\nrule 807 or rule 801(d)(1)(B) of the Minnesota Rules of Evidence. Kihanya\u2019s counsel did\n\nnot object, on the condition that A.E. would be available for cross-examination. The jury\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fsaw the video of her Red River Center forensic interview. A.E. testified the following\n\nday.\n\n       When A.E. testified, she briefly described her visit with her uncle\u2019s family and\n\nrecounted that she told her cousin H.N. that \u201creally bad stuff\u201d was \u201cgoing on at home.\u201d\n\nShe then had difficulty testifying. After a brief recess, she stated that she spoke with her\n\ncousin\u2019s mother, S.N., then told the same things to police, and later went to an interview.\n\nWhen asked about what happened in her home, A.E. said that it involved Kihanya and\n\nthat it was hard for her to talk about it because she was scared. During cross-examination,\n\nA.E. confirmed a few details about the grabbing-from-behind incident, affirming that her\n\nbrother \u201csaw [Kihanya] reach over, put his hands on [her] private area.\u201d\n\n       Police officers and family members also testified. A.E.\u2019s brother discussed his\n\nown forensic interview, which the jury had also seen. He said that he only witnessed an\n\nincident in which A.E. was dancing to music in their living room and their stepfather\n\nbegan dancing behind her, reached over her shoulder, and \u201cgrabbed her\u201d vaginal area for\n\nbetween two and five seconds. Seeing this happen \u201cstunned\u201d him. The brother said that\n\nhe could not see Kihanya\u2019s expression, but his sister had an \u201coh my God what\u2019s going on\n\nkind of face\u201d and she stopped dancing and walked away. The brother affirmed his\n\nstatement in the video interview that Kihanya had intentionally touched A.E. while\n\n\u201ctrying to make it seem like nothing [was] going on.\u201d On cross-examination, he also\n\nstated: \u201cWell it didn\u2019t look accidentally. It looked sort of on purpose. . . . I\u2019m not sure.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d He then repeated that he did not think it was an accident and that\n\nKihanya did not trip and fall onto A.E.\n\n\n                                             4\n\f         The last witness was A.E.\u2019s friend A.C. who testified that A.E. told her that\n\nKihanya \u201cwas touching her in inappropriate spots.\u201d She said that A.E. had first disclosed\n\nthese allegations to her over two years earlier and seemed very nervous and scared. A.E.\n\nlater told A.C. about other incidents. The prosecution asserted that A.C.\u2019s testimony\n\nabout A.E.\u2019s confidences were prior consistent statements, admissible under rule of\n\nevidence 801(d)(1)(B). Kihanya did not object to this testimony.\n\n         The state\u2019s closing argument relied heavily on the two forensic interviews both to\n\nbolster A.E.\u2019s and her brother\u2019s credibility and as substantive evidence to establish the\n\nstate\u2019s version of events. The jury found Kihanya guilty of both counts of second-degree\n\ncriminal sexual contact. The court sentenced him to a total of 84 months for the two\n\ncrimes, but it stayed execution and placed him on supervised probation for up to 25 years.\n\n         Kihanya appeals, requesting a new trial or reversal of both convictions.\n\n                                       DECISION\n\n                                              I.\n\n         The first issue in this appeal is whether the district court should have excluded\n\nA.E.\u2019s forensic-interview video, as well as the testimony of A.E.\u2019s friend A.C.,\n\nrecounting A.E.\u2019s prior out-of-court statements. Kihanya did not object to this evidence at\n\ntrial.\n\n         The district court has sound discretion over evidentiary matters. State v. Amos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1298251\"><a href=\"/opinion/1298251/state-v-amos/\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 203 (Minn. 2003). We will not reverse its evidentiary rulings unless an\n\nappellant shows both a clear abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice. Id. If the\n\nappellant does not object to an error at trial, we apply the plain-error standard. State v.\n\n\n                                              5\n\fGriller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1881458\"><a href=\"/opinion/1881458/state-v-griller/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 740 (Minn. 1998). Under that standard we only reverse if there\n\nis error which is plain and affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and reversal is\n\nnecessary \u201cto ensure fairness and the integrity of the judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. The issue\n\non appeal is whether the presentation of this evidence violated the plain-error standard.\n\n       A.     A.E.\u2019s Interview\n\n       Kihanya contends that A.E.\u2019s interview video is inadmissible hearsay. Hearsay is a\n\nstatement made by a declarant outside of the trial or hearing and is offered to prove that\n\nthe matter asserted in the statement is true. Minn. R. Evid. 801(c). Hearsay is not\n\nadmissible as substantive evidence unless it falls into an exception under the rules of\n\nevidence. Minn. R. Evid. 802; State v. Ashby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1715738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1715738/state-v-ashby/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26 (Minn. 1997).\n\n              1.     Rule 807 Exception\n\n       Rule of evidence 807 provides an exception to the hearsay rule for statements not\n\nspecifically covered by the hearsay exceptions in rules 803 or 804 but that have\n\n\u201cequivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Minn. R. Evid. 807. To\n\ndetermine whether a statement has sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness, we review the\n\ntotality of the circumstances. State v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1621287\"><a href=\"/opinion/1621287/state-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">725</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (Minn. 2007)\n\n(applying this analysis to rule 803(24), the predecessor of rule 807). Analyzing rule 807\n\nhere, we assume that A.E.\u2019s interview video was hearsay.\n\n       Kihanya argues that the statements in A.E.\u2019s interview do not comport with indicia\n\nof reliability set forth in the case of State v. Ortlepp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2232511\"><a href=\"/opinion/2232511/state-v-ortlepp/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Minn. 1985). There,\n\nthe court identified several factors that made a prior statement \u201cparticularly reliable.\u201d Id.\n\nat 44. These include the declarant admitting making the prior statement and being\n\n\n                                             6\n\favailable for cross-examination and the statement being taped, consistent with other\n\nevidence, and against the declarant\u2019s penal interest. Id. The Ortlepp factors are not a\n\nclosed list or strictly required. Martinez, 725 N.W.2d at 738. Other \u201c[r]elevant factors\n\ngenerally considered\u201d include whether the statement was given voluntarily, under oath,\n\nand subject to penalty of perjury, the declarant\u2019s relationship to the parties, the\n\ndeclarant\u2019s motivation to make the statement, the declarant\u2019s personal knowledge, and\n\nthe character of the declarant for truthfulness and honesty. State v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">525</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537 (Minn. 2012).\n\n      The supreme court has also recognized factors relevant to admission of forensic\n\ninterviews in the parallel context of Minnesota Statutes section 595.02, subdivision 3. In\n\nre Welfare of L.E.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2114438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2114438/in-re-welfare-of-lep/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 170 (Minn. 1999). That statute creates an\n\nexception to the hearsay bar for statements made by child sex-abuse victims younger than\n\nten. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 595.02, subd. 3 (2012). Although A.E. had just recently turned ten\n\nwhen she testified at trial and the statute is not directly applicable in this appeal, such\n\ncaselaw identifies factors that are helpful. They include reliability considerations,\n\n\u201cspontaneity, consistent repetition, [the child\u2019s] mental state . . . , use of terminology\n\nunexpected of a child of similar age,\u201d as well as the temporal proximity to the events\n\ndescribed, and whether the interviewer \u201chad a preconceived idea of what the child would\n\nsay\u201d or asked leading or suggestive questions. L.E.P., 594 N.W.2d at 170.\n\n      The interview here was videotaped, so there is no question about what A.E. said or\n\nhow she said it. The videotape also shows that the interviewer was extremely sensitive to\n\neliciting truthful answers and avoided planting ideas in A.E.\u2019s mind. And there is no\n\n\n                                            7\n\fevidence that anyone had prepared A.E. for the interview or that A.E. had any motive to\n\nlie. To the contrary, A.E. feared that her statements would bring a negative response from\n\nher relatives, on whom she depends. The interview statements also do not contradict\n\nother evidence. A.E.\u2019s brother witnessed and testified to one incident of touching. To the\n\nextent A.E.\u2019s video-interview statements went beyond her trial testimony, Kihanya had\n\nthe opportunity to cross-examine A.E. about them. Despite her difficultly answering\n\nopen-ended questions on direct examination, A.E. was able to respond to yes-or-no\n\nquestions on cross-examination. Kihanya simply chose to limit his questioning. The\n\ncircumstances of the forensic interview and the trial offer indicia of reliability supporting\n\nthe district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n       We note that the district court did not make an express reliability finding here. The\n\ndistrict court generally must make findings that show its reliability analysis under rule\n\n807. State v. DeRosier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1278902\"><a href=\"/opinion/1278902/state-v-derosier/\"><span class=\"volume\">695</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (Minn. 2005). But findings on reliability are\n\nrequired only if the defendant objects to evidence being admitted. Id. (requiring \u201cfindings\n\nexplicitly on the record unless there is a waiver, explicitly or by silence\u201d (quotation\n\nomitted)). Kihanya never raised the issue at trial, so findings were unnecessary. We\n\nconclude that the district court did not plainly err by admitting A.E.\u2019s forensic-interview\n\nvideo under rule 807 and that the plain-error standard for reversal is not met.\n\n              2. Rule 801(d)(1)(B)\n\n       The state also asserts that A.E.\u2019s interview statements are admissible as non-\n\nhearsay under rule of evidence 801(d)(1)(B). Because the rule 807 exception is\n\napplicable, we do not decide the interview\u2019s admissibility under rule 801(d)(1)(B).\n\n\n                                              8\n\f      B.     A.C.\u2019s Testimony\n\n      Next, we consider admissibility of friend A.C.\u2019s testimony about what A.E. had\n\ntold her.1 Kihanya argues that A.C.\u2019s testimony was hearsay and was not admissible\n\nunder rule of evidence 801(d)(1)(B), the only grounds presented at trial. A.C. testified\n\nthat A.E. had told her that Kihanya \u201cwas touching her in inappropriate spots.\u201d This\n\ntestimony did not go beyond A.E.\u2019s own testimony, which affirmed that Kihanya had\n\ntouched her \u201cprivate area.\u201d And unlike A.E.\u2019s interview video, A.C.\u2019s testimony was\n\nadmitted after A.E. took the stand. The district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nadmitting this testimony as prior consistent evidence supporting A.E.\u2019s credibility. Thus,\n\nwe conclude that Kihanya has not met the plain-error standard.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      The next issue is whether the evidence was sufficient to find Kihanya guilty of\n\nboth counts. The state has to prove each element of charged crimes beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. State v. Merrill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032608\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032608/state-v-merrill/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366 (Minn. 1988); see also U.S. Const. amends.\n\nV, XIV; Minn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7. We examine whether the jury could reasonably conclude\n\nthat the defendant was guilty of the charged offense. State v.

We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict\n\nand assume that the jury disbelieved any testimony conflicting with this result. State v.\n\nDaniels, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1893619\"><a href=\"/opinion/1893619/state-v-daniels/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 826 (Minn. 1985).\n\n\n\n1\n The state used A.C.\u2019s testimony primarily to bolster A.E.\u2019s credibility, but the district\ncourt admitted the testimony without any instruction against using it as substantive\nevidence of guilt.\n\n                                            9\n\f       As to the first count, which occurred when A.E. was sleeping on the couch,\n\nKihanya argues that there was insufficient evidence of sexual contact in the physical\n\nsense. To prove the second-degree criminal sexual conduct charge, the state had to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Kihanya engaged in sexual contact with the victim. Minn.\n\nStat. \u00a7 609.343, subd. 1(a) (2012). Sexual contact may occur through \u201cintentional\n\ntouching . . . of the [victim\u2019s] intimate parts\u201d or \u201cclothing covering the immediate area of\n\nthe intimate parts.\u201d Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.341, subd. 11(a)(i), (iv) (2012). The definition of\n\nintimate parts \u201cincludes the primary genital area [and] groin.\u201d Id., subd. 5 (2012). A.E.\n\nexplained in her video interview that Kihanya touches her vaginal area and that she woke\n\nto his moving his finger against privates underneath her clothes. These statements were\n\nsufficient evidence to prove that Kihanya touched A.E.\u2019s intimate parts, the count I\n\noffense.\n\n       As to the second count, arising from Kihanya touching A.E.\u2019s vaginal area while\n\nshe was dancing, Kihanya argues that the state failed to prove that his physical contact\n\nwas intentional. He notes that A.E.\u2019s brother was the only witness to provide a detailed\n\ndescription of the incident and was not completely sure that the touching was not an\n\naccident.

But none of the physical acts that the brother described suggests an\n\naccident. Kihanya does not even attempt to explain how he could unintentionally stand\n\nbehind his nine-year-old stepdaughter, stretch his arm over her shoulder, reach down to\n\nher vaginal area, and hold his hand there for two or more seconds. The jury had no reason\n\nto doubt that he understood where he placed his hand on A.E.\u2019s body. His warning A.E.\n\nnot to tell anyone also cuts against any suggestion of innocent mistake.

Kihanya argues that the district court erred\n\nby admitting the girl\u2019s out-of-court statements and that without these statements, there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to convict him. He further argues that with respect to the\n\nsecond count, the evidence did not show that his contact with the victim was intentional.\n\nBecause the district court did not plainly err in admitting the evidence and because there\n\nwas sufficient evidence for the jury to find Kihanya guilty of both counts, we affirm.\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       At the time of the charged incidents, appellant Kihanya was living in Goodview,\n\nMinnesota, with his wife, their two children, and his wife\u2019s two children from a prior\n\nrelationship: a boy and a girl, A.E. During a visit with an uncle\u2019s family in North Dakota\n\nin July 2013, A.E. told a 12-year-old female cousin, H.N., that Kihanya touches her. A.E.\n\ntold H.N. not to tell anyone and ran to another room. H.N. asked A.E.\u2019s brother, who was\n\nalso visiting, whether he had seen any contact. He confirmed that he had. H.N. called her\n\nmother, S.N., at work. S.N. promptly returned home. A.E. initially told S.N. that no abuse\n\nhad occurred, but then started crying and told her that Kihanya had touched her. S.N.\n\nbrought A.E. to the local police station where they spoke with an investigator who\n\narranged for A.E. to interview with a specialist at Red River Children\u2019s Advocacy Center.\n\nHaving learned that A.E.\u2019s brother was a witness, police arranged for him to also be\n\ninterviewed at the center.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       The forensic interviewer at the Red River Center conducted a videotaped, one-\n\nhour conversation with A.E. A.E. told the interviewer that she was there because of \u201cwhat\n\n[her] stepdad does,\u201d and she wrote, \u201cHe touches me in places he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d She clarified\n\nthat she meant her \u201cprivates,\u201d which she uses to \u201cgo pee.\u201d She explained that Kihanya\n\nuses his finger, that it happens at home, and that he had done so several times, beginning\n\nwhen she was eight years old. The most recent contact occurred on an evening when the\n\nfamily was moving to another residence. A.E. said that she was sleeping on a couch and\n\nwoke to Kihanya standing next to her, moving his finger in her crotch under her clothes.\n\nA.E. also disclosed an incident that her brother had witnessed when Kihanya came up\n\nbehind her, \u201cgrab[bed]\u201d her privates over her clothes, and pulled her to him. A.E. said\n\nthat Kihanya told her not to tell anyone. She was afraid to tell her mother or grandmother\n\nabout Kihanya\u2019s conduct because she thought they would become angry. Further inquiry\n\nrevealed that A.E. had earlier told a friend, A.C., that Kihanya had been touching her\n\ninappropriately.\n\n       Kihanya was charged with two second-degree criminal sexual offenses under\n\nMinnesota Statutes section 609.343, subdivision 1(a) (2012). Count I addresses the couch\n\nincident; count II relates to the grabbing-from-behind incident.\n\n       Before trial, the state noted A.E.\u2019s difficulty discussing the abuse and informed\n\ndefense counsel that it intended to introduce A.E.\u2019s videotaped forensic interviews under\n\nrule 807 or rule 801(d)(1)(B) of the Minnesota Rules of Evidence. Kihanya\u2019s counsel did\n\nnot object, on the condition that A.E. would be available for cross-examination. The jury\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fsaw the video of her Red River Center forensic interview. A.E. testified the following\n\nday.\n\n       When A.E. testified, she briefly described her visit with her uncle\u2019s family and\n\nrecounted that she told her cousin H.N. that \u201creally bad stuff\u201d was \u201cgoing on at home.\u201d\n\nShe then had difficulty testifying. After a brief recess, she stated that she spoke with her\n\ncousin\u2019s mother, S.N., then told the same things to police, and later went to an interview.\n\nWhen asked about what happened in her home, A.E. said that it involved Kihanya and\n\nthat it was hard for her to talk about it because she was scared. During cross-examination,\n\nA.E. confirmed a few details about the grabbing-from-behind incident, affirming that her\n\nbrother \u201csaw [Kihanya] reach over, put his hands on [her] private area.\u201d\n\n       Police officers and family members also testified. A.E.\u2019s brother discussed his\n\nown forensic interview, which the jury had also seen. He said that he only witnessed an\n\nincident in which A.E. was dancing to music in their living room and their stepfather\n\nbegan dancing behind her, reached over her shoulder, and \u201cgrabbed her\u201d vaginal area for\n\nbetween two and five seconds. Seeing this happen \u201cstunned\u201d him. The brother said that\n\nhe could not see Kihanya\u2019s expression, but his sister had an \u201coh my God what\u2019s going on\n\nkind of face\u201d and she stopped dancing and walked away. The brother affirmed his\n\nstatement in the video interview that Kihanya had intentionally touched A.E. while\n\n\u201ctrying to make it seem like nothing [was] going on.\u201d On cross-examination, he also\n\nstated: \u201cWell it didn\u2019t look accidentally. It looked sort of on purpose. . . . I\u2019m not sure.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d He then repeated that he did not think it was an accident and that\n\nKihanya did not trip and fall onto A.E.\n\n\n                                             4\n\f         The last witness was A.E.\u2019s friend A.C. who testified that A.E. told her that\n\nKihanya \u201cwas touching her in inappropriate spots.\u201d She said that A.E. had first disclosed\n\nthese allegations to her over two years earlier and seemed very nervous and scared. A.E.\n\nlater told A.C. about other incidents. The prosecution asserted that A.C.\u2019s testimony\n\nabout A.E.\u2019s confidences were prior consistent statements, admissible under rule of\n\nevidence 801(d)(1)(B). Kihanya did not object to this testimony.\n\n         The state\u2019s closing argument relied heavily on the two forensic interviews both to\n\nbolster A.E.\u2019s and her brother\u2019s credibility and as substantive evidence to establish the\n\nstate\u2019s version of events. The jury found Kihanya guilty of both counts of second-degree\n\ncriminal sexual contact. The court sentenced him to a total of 84 months for the two\n\ncrimes, but it stayed execution and placed him on supervised probation for up to 25 years.\n\n         Kihanya appeals, requesting a new trial or reversal of both convictions.\n\n                                       DECISION\n\n                                              I.\n\n         The first issue in this appeal is whether the district court should have excluded\n\nA.E.\u2019s forensic-interview video, as well as the testimony of A.E.\u2019s friend A.C.,\n\nrecounting A.E.\u2019s prior out-of-court statements. Kihanya did not object to this evidence at\n\ntrial.\n\n         The district court has sound discretion over evidentiary matters. State v. Amos, 658\n\nN.W.2d 201, 203 (Minn. 2003). We will not reverse its evidentiary rulings unless an\n\nappellant shows both a clear abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice. Id. If the\n\nappellant does not object to an error at trial, we apply the plain-error standard. State v.\n\n\n                                              5\n\fGriller, 583 N.W.2d 736, 740 (Minn. 1998). Under that standard we only reverse if there\n\nis error which is plain and affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights and reversal is\n\nnecessary \u201cto ensure fairness and the integrity of the judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. The issue\n\non appeal is whether the presentation of this evidence violated the plain-error standard.\n\n       A.     A.E.\u2019s Interview\n\n       Kihanya contends that A.E.\u2019s interview video is inadmissible hearsay. Hearsay is a\n\nstatement made by a declarant outside of the trial or hearing and is offered to prove that\n\nthe matter asserted in the statement is true. Minn. R. Evid. 801(c). Hearsay is not\n\nadmissible as substantive evidence unless it falls into an exception under the rules of\n\nevidence. Minn. R. Evid. 802; State v. Ashby, 567 N.W.2d 21, 26 (Minn. 1997).\n\n              1.     Rule 807 Exception\n\n       Rule of evidence 807 provides an exception to the hearsay rule for statements not\n\nspecifically covered by the hearsay exceptions in rules 803 or 804 but that have\n\n\u201cequivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d Minn. R. Evid. 807. To\n\ndetermine whether a statement has sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness, we review the\n\ntotality of the circumstances. State v. Martinez, 725 N.W.2d 733, 737 (Minn. 2007)\n\n(applying this analysis to rule 803(24), the predecessor of rule 807). Analyzing rule 807\n\nhere, we assume that A.E.\u2019s interview video was hearsay.\n\n       Kihanya argues that the statements in A.E.\u2019s interview do not comport with indicia\n\nof reliability set forth in the case of State v. Ortlepp, 363 N.W.2d 39 (Minn. 1985). There,\n\nthe court identified several factors that made a prior statement \u201cparticularly reliable.\u201d Id.\n\nat 44. These include the declarant admitting making the prior statement and being\n\n\n                                             6\n\favailable for cross-examination and the statement being taped, consistent with other\n\nevidence, and against the declarant\u2019s penal interest. Id. The Ortlepp factors are not a\n\nclosed list or strictly required. Martinez, 725 N.W.2d at 738. Other \u201c[r]elevant factors\n\ngenerally considered\u201d include whether the statement was given voluntarily, under oath,\n\nand subject to penalty of perjury, the declarant\u2019s relationship to the parties, the\n\ndeclarant\u2019s motivation to make the statement, the declarant\u2019s personal knowledge, and\n\nthe character of the declarant for truthfulness and honesty. State v. Davis, 820 N.W.2d\n\n525, 537 (Minn. 2012).\n\n      The supreme court has also recognized factors relevant to admission of forensic\n\ninterviews in the parallel context of Minnesota Statutes section 595.02, subdivision 3. In\n\nre Welfare of L.E.P., 594 N.W.2d 163, 170 (Minn. 1999). That statute creates an\n\nexception to the hearsay bar for statements made by child sex-abuse victims younger than\n\nten. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 595.02, subd. 3 (2012). Although A.E. had just recently turned ten\n\nwhen she testified at trial and the statute is not directly applicable in this appeal, such\n\ncaselaw identifies factors that are helpful. They include reliability considerations,\n\n\u201cspontaneity, consistent repetition, [the child\u2019s] mental state . . . , use of terminology\n\nunexpected of a child of similar age,\u201d as well as the temporal proximity to the events\n\ndescribed, and whether the interviewer \u201chad a preconceived idea of what the child would\n\nsay\u201d or asked leading or suggestive questions. L.E.P., 594 N.W.2d at 170.\n\n      The interview here was videotaped, so there is no question about what A.E. said or\n\nhow she said it. The videotape also shows that the interviewer was extremely sensitive to\n\neliciting truthful answers and avoided planting ideas in A.E.\u2019s mind. And there is no\n\n\n                                            7\n\fevidence that anyone had prepared A.E. for the interview or that A.E. had any motive to\n\nlie. To the contrary, A.E. feared that her statements would bring a negative response from\n\nher relatives, on whom she depends. The interview statements also do not contradict\n\nother evidence. A.E.\u2019s brother witnessed and testified to one incident of touching. To the\n\nextent A.E.\u2019s video-interview statements went beyond her trial testimony, Kihanya had\n\nthe opportunity to cross-examine A.E. about them. Despite her difficultly answering\n\nopen-ended questions on direct examination, A.E. was able to respond to yes-or-no\n\nquestions on cross-examination. Kihanya simply chose to limit his questioning. The\n\ncircumstances of the forensic interview and the trial offer indicia of reliability supporting\n\nthe district court\u2019s exercise of discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n       We note that the district court did not make an express reliability finding here. The\n\ndistrict court generally must make findings that show its reliability analysis under rule\n\n807. State v. DeRosier, 695 N.W.2d 97, 105 (Minn. 2005). But findings on reliability are\n\nrequired only if the defendant objects to evidence being admitted. Id. (requiring \u201cfindings\n\nexplicitly on the record unless there is a waiver, explicitly or by silence\u201d (quotation\n\nomitted)). Kihanya never raised the issue at trial, so findings were unnecessary. We\n\nconclude that the district court did not plainly err by admitting A.E.\u2019s forensic-interview\n\nvideo under rule 807 and that the plain-error standard for reversal is not met.\n\n              2. Rule 801(d)(1)(B)\n\n       The state also asserts that A.E.\u2019s interview statements are admissible as non-\n\nhearsay under rule of evidence 801(d)(1)(B). Because the rule 807 exception is\n\napplicable, we do not decide the interview\u2019s admissibility under rule 801(d)(1)(B).\n\n\n                                              8\n\f      B.     A.C.\u2019s Testimony\n\n      Next, we consider admissibility of friend A.C.\u2019s testimony about what A.E. had\n\ntold her.1 Kihanya argues that A.C.\u2019s testimony was hearsay and was not admissible\n\nunder rule of evidence 801(d)(1)(B), the only grounds presented at trial. A.C. testified\n\nthat A.E. had told her that Kihanya \u201cwas touching her in inappropriate spots.\u201d This\n\ntestimony did not go beyond A.E.\u2019s own testimony, which affirmed that Kihanya had\n\ntouched her \u201cprivate area.\u201d And unlike A.E.\u2019s interview video, A.C.\u2019s testimony was\n\nadmitted after A.E. took the stand. The district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nadmitting this testimony as prior consistent evidence supporting A.E.\u2019s credibility. Thus,\n\nwe conclude that Kihanya has not met the plain-error standard.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      The next issue is whether the evidence was sufficient to find Kihanya guilty of\n\nboth counts. The state has to prove each element of charged crimes beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. State v. Merrill, 428 N.W.2d 361, 366 (Minn. 1988); see also U.S. Const. amends.\n\nV, XIV; Minn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7. We examine whether the jury could reasonably conclude\n\nthat the defendant was guilty of the charged offense. State v. Combs, 195 N.W.2d 176,\n\n178 (Minn. 1972). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict\n\nand assume that the jury disbelieved any testimony conflicting with this result. State v.\n\nDaniels, 361 N.W.2d 819, 826 (Minn. 1985).\n\n\n\n1\n The state used A.C.\u2019s testimony primarily to bolster A.E.\u2019s credibility, but the district\ncourt admitted the testimony without any instruction against using it as substantive\nevidence of guilt.\n\n                                            9\n\f       As to the first count, which occurred when A.E. was sleeping on the couch,\n\nKihanya argues that there was insufficient evidence of sexual contact in the physical\n\nsense. To prove the second-degree criminal sexual conduct charge, the state had to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Kihanya engaged in sexual contact with the victim. Minn.\n\nStat. \u00a7 609.343, subd. 1(a) (2012). Sexual contact may occur through \u201cintentional\n\ntouching . . . of the [victim\u2019s] intimate parts\u201d or \u201cclothing covering the immediate area of\n\nthe intimate parts.\u201d Minn. Stat. \u00a7 609.341, subd. 11(a)(i), (iv) (2012). The definition of\n\nintimate parts \u201cincludes the primary genital area [and] groin.\u201d Id., subd. 5 (2012). A.E.\n\nexplained in her video interview that Kihanya touches her vaginal area and that she woke\n\nto his moving his finger against privates underneath her clothes. These statements were\n\nsufficient evidence to prove that Kihanya touched A.E.\u2019s intimate parts, the count I\n\noffense.\n\n       As to the second count, arising from Kihanya touching A.E.\u2019s vaginal area while\n\nshe was dancing, Kihanya argues that the state failed to prove that his physical contact\n\nwas intentional. He notes that A.E.\u2019s brother was the only witness to provide a detailed\n\ndescription of the incident and was not completely sure that the touching was not an\n\naccident. Sexual contact requires \u201cintentional touching\u201d that is \u201ccommitted with sexual or\n\naggressive intent.\u201d Id., subd. 11(a)(i). We have defined sexual intent as occurring \u201cwhen\n\nthe actor perceives himself to be acting based on sexual desire or in pursuit of sexual\n\ngratification.\u201d State v. Austin, 788 N.W.2d 788, 792 (Minn. App. 2010), review denied\n\n(Minn. Dec. 14, 2010). Mere accidental contact does not carry criminal liability under\n\nMinnesota Statutes section 609.341. Id.\n\n\n                                            10\n\f         Intent is generally proven by circumstantial evidence. State v. Davis, 656 N.W.2d\n\n900, 905 (Minn. App. 2003), review denied (Minn. May 20, 2003). We apply a\n\ncircumstantial evidence standard of review when the state proves an element of a crime\n\nthrough circumstantial evidence alone. State v. Al-Naseer, 788 N.W.2d 469, 474\u201375\n\n(Minn. 2010). We first identify the circumstances proven, reviewing the direct evidence\n\nfavorably to the verdict. Id. at 473. We then determine what inferences can reasonably be\n\ndrawn from these circumstances. Id. at 473\u201374. And we decide whether the\n\ncircumstances proved are \u201cconsistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty and\n\ninconsistent with any rational hypothesis except that of his guilt.\u201d State v. Stein, 776\n\nN.W.2d 709, 714\u201315 (Minn. 2010) (quotation omitted). A defendant\u2019s claim of other\n\ntheoretically possible interpretations of events does not require us to reverse a conviction\n\nsupported by circumstantial evidence. State v. Tscheu, 758 N.W.2d 849, 859 (Minn.\n\n2008).\n\n         A.E.\u2019s brother testified about Kihanya\u2019s conduct during the dancing incident. He\n\nsaid that Kihanya approached A.E. from behind, and reaching over her shoulder, grabbed\n\nher in her vaginal area for two to five seconds. He testified that A.E. had an \u201coh my God\n\nwhat\u2019s going on kind of face\u201d and then walked away. This indicates that at a minimum\n\nshe appeared surprised and upset. A.E. herself added that Kihanya \u201ctold [her] not to tell\n\nanyone.\u201d And the brother stated that the contact did not appear accidental and that\n\nKihanya did not simply trip and fall into A.E. He both testified that he thought Kihanya\n\nhad intentionally touched A.E. while trying to make it seem accidental and admitted on\n\ncross-examination that he was not completely sure.\n\n\n                                            11\n\f       Because the jury found Kihanya guilty, we assume that the jury believed the\n\nchildren\u2019s description of the event. See Daniels, 361 N.W.2d at 826. We nonetheless\n\nrecognize that the jury could form its own inferences about Kihanya\u2019s intent and was not\n\nbound by the brother\u2019s mixed opinion. See State v. Holbrook, 305 Minn. 554, 557, 233\n\nN.W.2d 892, 894 (1975) (deciding that a jury may accept some aspects of a witness\u2019s\n\ntestimony while rejecting others); Ruppert v. Yaeger, 414 N.W.2d 419, 423 (Minn. App.\n\n1987) (noting that the jury is entitled to reject opinion evidence).\n\n       Kihanya argues that under the circumstantial evidence standard of review, we\n\ncannot rule out a reasonable inference that his contact with A.E.\u2019s vaginal area was\n\nmerely accidental. But none of the physical acts that the brother described suggests an\n\naccident. Kihanya does not even attempt to explain how he could unintentionally stand\n\nbehind his nine-year-old stepdaughter, stretch his arm over her shoulder, reach down to\n\nher vaginal area, and hold his hand there for two or more seconds. The jury had no reason\n\nto doubt that he understood where he placed his hand on A.E.\u2019s body. His warning A.E.\n\nnot to tell anyone also cuts against any suggestion of innocent mistake. And only\n\nconjecture could suggest that he had any purpose for his intentional touching besides\n\nsexual gratification. Because there is no rational hypothesis except that of guilt, we\n\nconclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the verdict on count II.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f", "Reporter_Citation": "", "CL_opinion_type": "010combined", "ML_Tags_Text": [], "Cited_No": 0, "CL_opinion_sha1": "a42aa69b5c3ab42ff974a51237658a2d8a45d0e4", "Document_Level_Notes": "", "Court": "Court of Appeals of Minnesota", "Text_Level_Tags": [], "Review_Status": "Yet To Start", "Searchtags": [], "Cases_Cited_Link": ["http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1271749/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1278902/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1298251/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1608667/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1621287/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1700004/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1715738/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1839632/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1881458/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1889569/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1890426/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/1893619/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2032608/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2044007/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2114438/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2182805/", "http://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/opinions/2232511/"], "old_Case_Citation": "", "Data_source": "Court Listener", "CL_opinion_date_created": "2015-08-11T04:32:50.707978Z", "CL_opinion_per_curiam": false, "Rule_Tags": "", "ML_Tags": [], "CL_opinion_page_count": 12, "CL_opinion_absolute_url": "/opinion/2824270/state-of-minnesota-v-charles-kihanya/", "Duplicate": "No", "HTML_Stored": 1, "ML_Tags_Doc_Level": [], "CL_opinion_extracted_by_ocr": false, "CL_opinion_author_str": "", "PartyType1": "", "CL_opinion_id": "2824270", "Old_Case_No": "", "Case_ID": "State of Minnesota v.
