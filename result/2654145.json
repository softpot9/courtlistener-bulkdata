Kitchen challenged the validity of the last will and testament of\n\nher mother, Loree Isenberg, on the grounds Isenberg\u2019s signature on the April 12, 2002,\n\nwill was forged and, alternatively, the will was procured by means of undue influence\n\nand fraud on the part of Isenberg\u2019s oldest daughter, Deborah L. Collis (Debbie). The will\n\ndisinherited five of Isenberg\u2019s six adult children, including Kitchen, and left Isenberg\u2019s\n\nentire estate in equal shares to her brother, respondent Kenneth E. Foxford, and Debbie.\n\n       When Isenberg died on June 18, 2003, her principal asset was her interest in a $4.2\n\nmillion personal injury judgment which was on appeal. The judgment was affirmed on\n\nappeal in June 2004, and Debbie died in September 2004. A probate was not opened for\n\nthe will. In 2005, Kitchen filed the present petition seeking to invalidate the will and\n\ntransfer Isenberg\u2019s personal injury award and other assets to Kitchen on behalf of herself\n\nand Isenberg\u2019s other intestate heirs. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 850.)\n\n       After hearing evidence over six court days in May 2010, the trial court granted\n\nrespondents\u2019 motion for judgment and issued a statement of decision (Code Civ. Proc.,\n\n\u00a7 631.8),1 discrediting much of Kitchen\u2019s evidence and concluding she failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence to support her claims. Judgment was entered in favor of respondents\n\nand the proponents of the will, Kenneth E. Foxford and William Collis, Jr., the\n\nadministrator of Debbie\u2019s estate.\n\n\n       1 All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless\notherwise indicated.\n\n                                             2\n\f       On this appeal, Kitchen claims the trial court violated section 631.8 and denied her\n\ndue process in granting the motion for judgment without first reviewing and considering\n\nthree items of evidence: (1) a \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d videotape showing Isenberg at home and\n\nin excruciating pain in May 2002; (2) Isenberg\u2019s videotaped deposition, taken in her\n\npersonal injury action in July 2002, showing her in poor health and having difficulties\n\nwith her memory; and (3) the deposition transcript of Isenberg\u2019s longtime friend, Mary\n\nNelson, taken in 2009 and attesting to Isenberg\u2019s abiding love for all of her children and\n\ngrandchildren, and her intent to share her personal injury award with all of them.\n\n       We affirm. The contents of the allegedly disregarded evidence, which was\n\nbrought to the court\u2019s attention before the court ruled on the motion, was largely\n\ncumulative to the testimony of other witnesses, and was referred to by other witnesses\n\nand counsel. In addition, the court credited the entire testimony of Isenberg\u2019s personal\n\ninjury attorney, Steven Carlson, who testified he prepared the will and discussed it at\n\nlength with Isenberg both before and at the time she signed it on April 12, 2002, at Kaiser\n\nHospital in Riverside in the presence of Carlson, another witness, and a notary public.\n\nAccording to Carlson, Debbie was not present when the will was signed, and Isenberg\n\nhad reasons for disinheriting five of her children, and she did not want her will discussed\n\nwith them.\n\n       The court concluded that even though Isenberg was susceptible to undue influence\n\nwhen she signed the will, the will was not the product of undue influence or fraud. We\n\ntherefore conclude that to the extent the court may have failed to view the day-in-the-life\n\n\n                                             3\n\fvideotape and deposition testimony, it is not reasonably probable Kitchen would have\n\nrealized a more favorable result had the court considered the evidence in detail. (Cal.\n\nConst., art. VI, \u00a7 13; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475.)\n\n                                   II. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Isenberg\u2019s Accident, Medical Condition, and Family Relationships\n\n       Isenberg died on June 18, 2003, at the age of 67. At the time she signed her will\n\non April 12, 2002, Isenberg was unmarried and had six adult children: Debbie, Mary K.\n\nWinkler (Kathy), Anthony Winkler, Jr. (Anthony), Jeffrey E. Winkler, Cynthia Babb, and\n\nKitchen. Kathy died in February 2003, predeceasing Isenberg. As noted, Debbie died in\n\nSeptember 2004.\n\n       On July 10, 2001, two years before her death, Isenberg suffered personal injuries,\n\nincluding blunt force trauma to the chest, when a car she was riding in was struck head-\n\non by an Anheuser-Busch beer truck. The driver of the car was killed, and Isenberg sued\n\nAnheuser-Busch, Inc. for her injuries. Isenberg was in poor health even before the\n\naccident: her pre-existing conditions included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\n\ncongestive heart failure, heart bypass surgery, insulin-dependent diabetes, and brain\n\natrophy. She was hospitalized for three days following the accident, then discharged to\n\nher home, but her condition quickly worsened.\n\n       In August 2001, a tracheotomy was performed to allow Isenberg to breathe\n\nthrough a ventilator, and she remained ventilator-dependent until February 2002.\n\nThereafter, she was periodically placed back on the ventilator and readmitted to various\n\n\n                                             4\n\fhospitals and a subacute care facility in Pomona known as Sunbridge. At home, she\n\nrequired 24-hour nursing care and a respiratory therapist.\n\n       Around February 2002, Debbie arranged for Isenberg to rent a trailer in Hemet, a\n\nshort walk from Debbie\u2019s trailer. Debbie spent many hours with Isenberg, both in\n\nIsenberg\u2019s trailer and when Isenberg was in the hospital and care facility, acting as\n\nIsenberg\u2019s self-appointed \u201cgatekeeper.\u201d Several of Isenberg\u2019s other adult children and\n\nher initial respiratory therapist, Dan Blair, testified Isenberg was fearful of Debbie, did\n\nnot trust Debbie, and did not want Debbie in charge of or making decisions concerning\n\nher estate. According to Babb, Debbie was always telling Isenberg about Debbie\u2019s\n\n\u201cproblems and [her] divorce,\u201d and this was stressful to Isenberg. According to Anthony,\n\nDebbie falsely told him she had a power of attorney for Isenberg, and the family had\n\nproblems with Debbie being \u201cdishonest and manipulative.\u201d\n\n       Additional testimony revealed that Debbie never interfered with Isenberg\u2019s\n\ncaretakers, never threatened to withhold food or medicine from Isenberg, and never\n\nprevented Isenberg\u2019s other children from visiting her outside Debbie\u2019s presence.\n\nAccording to Blair, Debbie only wanted to know what was going on with Isenberg, and\n\nIsenberg mistrusted and was frustrated with her entire family. Isenberg once told Blair\n\nshe wanted to leave her estate to him, and complained that her children never used to visit\n\nher but had been \u201caround her consistently\u201d since her accident. All of Isenberg\u2019s adult\n\nchildren who testified claimed they often visited Isenberg and had a good relationship\n\nwith her. An expert witness testified Isenberg was susceptible to undue influence, and\n\n\n                                              5\n\frelied in part on Nelson\u2019s 2009 deposition testimony that Isenberg loved all of her\n\nchildren and grandchildren and wanted to share her personal injury award with all of\n\nthem.\n\n        Kitchen testified that before the will was signed, Debbie told Kitchen that Debbie\n\nbelieved Isenberg wanted to establish a trust fund for her grandchildren. Kitchen and\n\nDebbie agreed Isenberg tended to favor the last child who visited her. According to\n\nKitchen, Debbie was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn that Foxford inherited half of Isenberg\u2019s estate.\n\nFoxford did not know he was a beneficiary of the will until after Isenberg died. Foxford\n\nalso testified there was \u201clots of turmoil\u201d in Isenberg\u2019s relationships with her children.\n\nPrior to the accident, Isenberg would be unhappy with one child one week and another\n\nchild the next.\n\nB. Carlson\u2019s Testimony and the Circumstances Surrounding the Will\n\n        Carlson prepared the will which Isenberg signed on April 12, 2002, in her room at\n\nKaiser Hospital in Riverside. On three or four occasions after February 2002, when she\n\nwas not on a ventilator, Isenberg told Carlson she wanted a will and wanted \u201cKenny [and]\n\nDebbie\u201d to inherit her estate. Carlson and a hospital security guard, Tim Bassin, who\n\nalso testified at trial, witnessed Isenberg sign the will and signed the will as witnesses. A\n\nnotary public also testified that she verified Isenberg\u2019s identity and witnessed her\n\nsignature. No one else was present when Isenberg signed the will. Carlson and Isenberg\n\nplanned on signing the will during the late morning when none of Isenberg\u2019s children,\n\nincluding Debbie, would be present.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Carlson read the will to Isenberg before she signed it, and Isenberg read the will\n\nherself. Isenberg\u2019s memory was good at the time; Carlson believed she had testamentary\n\ncapacity; and she never asked Carlson to change the will. According to Carlson, Isenberg\n\nhad problems with her children and reasons for disinheriting them; some owed her\n\nmoney; some had stolen from her; and some had had no contact with her. The children\u2019s\n\ntestimony showed Isenberg\u2019s beliefs were more or less true. For example, Anthony still\n\nowed Isenberg money. Isenberg instructed Carlson not to tell anyone about the will\n\nbecause it would cause conflicts in the family.\n\n       According to Carlson, Debbie was difficult and demanding on behalf of Isenberg;\n\nDebbie called Carlson\u2019s office almost daily, but she was not a \u201cbully.\u201d Isenberg was a\n\n\u201cnice lady,\u201d but also tough, strong-willed, and demanding. Preparing wills was\n\n\u201c[a]bsolutely not\u201d part of Carlson\u2019s law practice. Carlson had no notes concerning his\n\ndrafting of the will.\n\n       Around September 2001, when Carlson and his law partner Randy Johnson were\n\nfirst hired to represent Isenberg in her personal injury action, Isenberg had recently been\n\nin a coma and Johnson had another attorney draft conservatorship documents for\n\nIsenberg. But Isenberg later \u201ccame around\u201d and was \u201cdoing a lot better,\u201d and made it\n\nclear she did not want a conservator.\n\nC. Isenberg\u2019s Personal Injury Award and Judgment\n\n       In January 2003, a jury awarded Isenberg $4,256,385 in her personal injury action\n\nagainst Anheuser-Busch, Inc. The award was comprised of $3,026,385 for past and\n\n\n                                             7\n\ffuture medical expenses and $1,230,000 for pain and suffering. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.\n\nappealed. After Isenberg died in June 2003, no probate estate was opened for Isenberg.\n\nFoxford and Debbie substituted into the personal injury action as Isenberg\u2019s successors in\n\ninterest.\n\n       In June 2004, the personal injury judgment was affirmed on appeal.2 Debbie died\n\nin September 2004, survived by her two children, William Collis, Jr. and Nicole Weaver.\n\nRespondent William Collis, Jr. is the administrator of Debbie\u2019s estate. In her petition,\n\nKitchen alleges Anheuser-Busch, Inc. paid the judgment to Isenberg\u2019s personal injury\n\nattorneys, Carlson and Johnson. The attorneys, in turn, bypassed opening a probate or\n\nintestate estate for Isenberg, bypassed paying any creditors, and distributed\n\n$2,366,788.30 to themselves for their attorney fees; $998,121.71 to Foxford, and\n\n$973,766.71 to Debbie\u2019s estate.\n\nD. The Motion for Judgment and Statement of Decision\n\n       In her petition and at trial, Kitchen claimed Isenberg\u2019s signature on the will was\n\nforged and Debbie procured the will by means of undue influence. The petition asserted\n\nclaims of forgery, lack of due execution, lack of capacity, undue influence, fraud,\n\ncoercion, duress, menace, negligence, fraud and concealment, conversion, and\n\nconstructive trust against respondents.\n\n\n\n\n       2Debbie L. Collis v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (June 7, 2004, E033292) [Fourth Dist.,\nDiv. Two; nonpub. opn.].\n\n                                             8\n\f       On the morning of May 26, 2010, near the close of Kitchen\u2019s evidence, the court\n\nsuggested that respondents file a motion for judgment on the ground Kitchen did not\n\npresent sufficient evidence to support her claims. (\u00a7 638.1.) That same morning, the\n\ncourt admitted the three items of evidence Kitchen claims the court failed to consider\n\nbefore it ruled on the motion shortly after 1:30 p.m. that afternoon: (1) Isenberg\u2019s six-\n\nminute \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d videotape taken in May 2002, shortly after she signed the will;\n\n(2) Isenberg\u2019s 40-minute videotaped deposition taken in July 2002; and (3) the 167-page\n\ndeposition transcript of Nelson taken in 2009.\n\n       In granting the motion, the court explained its findings in detail, and recorded its\n\nfindings in its statement of decision. The court found the will was duly executed and\n\nwitnessed and there was no evidence it was procured by undue influence, fraud, coercion,\n\nduress, or menace. The court credited the testimony of Carlson, the other witness to the\n\nwill, and the notary public, and discredited the testimony of Kitchen\u2019s handwriting expert\n\nwho testified Isenberg\u2019s signature appeared to be forged. The court found Isenberg\u2019s\n\nsignature on the will was genuine.\n\n       The court found Kitchen did not establish a prima facie case or presumption of\n\nundue influence sufficient to shift the burden to respondents to prove the will was not the\n\nresult of undue influence. The three elements necessary to establish the presumption had\n\nnot been met: (1) there was no confidential relationship between Isenberg and either\n\nFoxford or Debbie; (2) neither Foxford nor Debbie actively participated in the\n\npreparation or execution of the will; and (3) there was no undue benefit to Foxford or\n\n\n                                              9\n\fDebbie because the disposition, though \u201csomewhat unusual,\u201d was \u201cwithin the realm of\n\nreasonableness\u201d and, as such, was insufficient to support a presumption of undue\n\ninfluence. The court also found Isenberg was \u201csusceptible to undue influence,\u201d but the\n\n\u201cevidence taken as a whole did not establish that the Will was procured as a result of that\n\nsusceptibility to undue influence . . . .\u201c\n\n                                      III. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Section 631.8 and the Standard of Review\n\n       After a party has completed presenting its evidence in a nonjury trial, other parties\n\nmay move for a judgment and statement of decision without waiving their right to present\n\ndefense or rebuttal evidence. (\u00a7 631.8, subd. (a).)3 The motion claims the party against\n\nwhom it is made presented insufficient evidence to sustain that party\u2019s burden of proof.\n\n(Combs v. Skyriver Communications, Inc. (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2303408\"><a href=\"/opinion/2303408/combs-v-skyriver-communications-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1262-1263.) If\n\nthe motion has merit, it dispenses with the need for the moving party to present evidence.\n\n(Roth v. Parker (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2307446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2307446/roth-v-parker/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549.) As Kitchen emphasizes, the court is\n\nrequired to weigh all the evidence submitted by the nonmoving party in ruling on a\n\nmotion for judgment. (County of Contra Costa v. Humore, Inc. (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2257375\"><a href=\"/opinion/2257375/county-of-contra-costa-v-humore-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1344.)\n\n       3 Section 631.8, subdivision (a) provides, in relevant part: \u201cAfter a party has\ncompleted his presentation of evidence in a trial by the court, the other party, without\nwaiving his right to offer evidence in support of his defense or in rebuttal in the event the\nmotion is not granted, may move for a judgment. The court as trier of the facts shall\nweigh the evidence and may render a judgment in favor of the moving party, in which\ncase the court shall make a statement of decision as provided in Sections 632 and 634\n. . . .\u201d\n\n                                             10\n\f       Because section 631.8 requires the court to \u201cweigh the evidence\u201d in ruling on a\n\nmotion for judgment, the court may discredit some testimony, credit other testimony, and\n\ndraw conclusions contrary to expert opinion. (Roth v. Parker, supra, 57 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n550; Jordan v. City of Santa Barbara (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256677\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256677/jordan-v-city-of-santa-barbara/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255.) We apply the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard of review to a judgment entered pursuant to section 631.8.\n\n(Combs v. Skyriver Communications, Inc., supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1263.) We\n\nreview the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment and draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the party prevailing on the motion. (Ibid.) We will not\n\nreverse the judgment if substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings.\n\n(Roth v. Parker, supra, at pp. 549-550.)\n\nB. Undue Influence\n\n       \u201c\u2018As a general proposition, California law allows a testator to dispose of property\n\nas he or she sees fit without regard to whether the dispositions specified are appropriate\n\nor fair. [Citations.] Testamentary competence is presumed. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d\n\n(Hagen v. Hickenbottom (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2306208\"><a href=\"/opinion/2306208/hagen-v-hickenbottom/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181.) But a will is subject to being\n\ninvalidated and set aside if it was procured as a result of undue influence. (Rice v. Clark\n\n(2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96; David v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684.) Proof of\n\nundue influence overcomes the presumption of testamentary competence. (Hagen v.\n\nHickenbottom, supra, at pp. 181-182.)\n\n       \u201cUndue influence is pressure brought to bear directly on the testamentary act,\n\nsufficient to overcome the testator\u2019s free will, amounting in effect to coercion destroying\n\n\n                                             11\n\fthe testator\u2019s free agency.\u201d (Rice v. Clark, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 96, italics added; see\n\nalso David v. Hermann, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 684.) Undue influence is subject to\n\nstrict rules of proof, reflecting the strength of the presumption in favor of the will or other\n\ntestamentary instrument and the testator\u2019s competence or testamentary capacity: To\n\nprove undue influence, it is must be shown that \u201c\u2018\u201cthe influence was such as, in effect, to\n\ndestroy the testator\u2019s free agency and substitute for his own another person\u2019s will.\n\n[Citation.] Evidence must be produced that pressure was brought to bear directly upon\n\nthe testamentary act. [Citation.] Mere general influence, however strong and controlling,\n\nnot brought to bear upon the testamentary act, is not enough; it must be influence used\n\ndirectly to procure the will and must amount to coercion destroying free agency on the\n\npart of the testator.

Hermann, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 684.) But a presumption of\n\nundue influence \u201c\u2018arises upon the challenger\u2019s showing that (1) the person alleged to\n\nhave exerted undue influence had a confidential relationship with the testator; (2) the\n\nperson actively participated in procuring the instrument\u2019s preparation or execution; and\n\n(3) the person would benefit unduly by the testamentary instrument.\u2019\u201d (Ibid.) When the\n\nchallenger establishes these three factors, the burden shifts to the proponent of the will or\n\nother testamentary instrument to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\ninstrument was not procured by undue influence. (Ibid.)\n\nC. Analysis\n\n       Kitchen does not claim she presented a prima facie case or sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a presumption of undue influence, and as indicated the trial court found she did\n\nnot meet this burden. Instead, she claims the court violated section 631.8 and her due\n\nprocess rights in failing to consider all of the evidence of undue influence before ruling\n\n\n                                             13\n\fon the motion for judgment, specifically: (1) Isenberg\u2019s six-minute \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d\n\nvideotape taken in May 2002; (2) Isenberg\u2019s 40-minute videotaped deposition taken in\n\nJuly 2002; and (3) Nelson\u2019s deposition testimony. She suggests that, had the court\n\nreviewed these items of evidence, it could have found she presented sufficient indicia of\n\nundue influence to meet her burden of proof on this claim.\n\n       It is unclear whether the court had a DVD player and monitor or similar equipment\n\nto view the two DVD\u2019s. In any event, it appears the court may not have had a chance to\n\nview the DVD\u2019s or read Nelson\u2019s deposition, over the lunch hour, before it granted the\n\nmotion shortly after 1:30 p.m. on May 26. Kitchen claims the court\u2019s failure to consider\n\nthe three items of evidence admitted earlier during the day requires reversal of the\n\njudgment and remand for a new trial. We disagree.\n\n       The court\u2019s alleged error in disregarding the proffered evidence is identical in\n\neffect to the erroneous exclusion of admissible evidence. Such error requires reversal\n\n\u201conly if the reviewing court is of the opinion, after examining the entire record, that it is\n\n[reasonably] probable that a result more favorable to appellants would have been reached\n\nabsent the error. [Citation.]\u201d (Lunghi v. Clark Equipment Co. (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2116709\"><a href=\"/opinion/2116709/lunghi-v-clark-equipment-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Code, \u00a7 354.)\n\n       Assuming the court did not view or consider the three items of evidence before it\n\ngranted the motion for judgment, the error was harmless to Kitchen. In view of all of the\n\nother evidence presented and the trial court\u2019s findings, it is not reasonably probable that\n\nthe court would have concluded that Kitchen presented sufficient indicia of undue\n\n\n                                              14\n\finfluence, or sufficient evidence to support her other claims, including fraud, had the\n\ncourt considered the allegedly disregarded evidence in detail.\n\n       The May 2002 day-in-the-life videotape of Isenberg, which was made for purposes\n\nof settlement in the personal injury action, shows Isenberg in her home, in excruciating\n\npain, and somewhat dependent on Debbie, but a nurse was tending to Isenberg\u2019s needs.\n\nIn the videotape, Isenberg is not on a ventilator, communicates well with Debbie and the\n\nnurse, and appears well aware of what is going on around her.\n\n       Isenberg\u2019s July 2002 videotaped deposition shows her having difficulty breathing,\n\nbut not on a ventilator, and having some difficulty recalling people, events, and other\n\nthings. For example, Isenberg at one point referred to \u201cKathy Collis\u201d but when prompted\n\nclarified she meant Debbie Collis. She appeared confused and said she did not know,\n\nwhen asked, what diabetes was, nor did she know whether she took insulin. But she\n\nrecalled breaking her hip around 1990; having heart surgery in 1999; and that she used to\n\nsmoke cigarettes \u201ca lot.\u201d She recalled she was coming from home and going to her\n\ndoctor\u2019s office in Hemet when the July 2001 accident occurred. She recalled shattering\n\nglass and being helped from the car by responders. She lived in Lake Elsinore before the\n\naccident but now lived alone in Hemet. She described her present pain and discomforts\n\nand recalled she had seven (not six) living children. Before the accident, she was on\n\nsocial security disability but could drive herself to the market. In short, the videotaped\n\ndeposition does not show Isenberg having significant memory lapses or not\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\funderstanding what was happening around her. She graciously thanked all of the\n\nattorneys at the end of the deposition.\n\n       In her 2009 deposition, Nelson described how she befriended Isenberg around\n\n1965, shortly after Isenberg\u2019s seventh child Sean died in his infancy, and had kept in\n\ntouch with Isenberg over the years. Nelson described how Isenberg loved all of her\n\nchildren and grandchildren. According to Nelson, before the accident Isenberg told\n\nNelson she wanted her youngest child, Kitchen, to inherit her \u201cpersonal stuff\u201d because\n\nshe wanted to \u201cmake up\u201d to Kitchen for leaving her and the other children\u2019s father when\n\nKitchen was very young. After the accident, Isenberg said she wanted to give \u201cthe little\n\nthings\u201d to her granddaughters.\n\n       Nelson also testified that Isenberg did not recall her children visiting her after the\n\naccident and believed they had not visited her in a long time. Around July 2002, Isenberg\n\nwas upset because she believed Debbie had lied about the other children not visiting her.\n\nIsenberg also told Nelson that Debbie had \u201cstolen\u201d some of her medications and money\n\nand she did not trust Debbie. Nelson believed Kitchen was the only child whom Isenberg\n\ntrusted. Isenberg wanted to purchase a large estate with her personal injury award and\n\nhave all of her children and grandchildren there. Isenberg \u201cwanted to do for all\u201d of her\n\nchildren and never told Nelson she wanted to disinherit any of her children.\n\n       Apart from the day-in-the-life videotape and the two depositions, the trial court\n\nheard ample testimony from other witnesses that Isenberg was in poor health and in a\n\nfragile mental state around the time she signed the will; that Isenberg loved all of her\n\n\n                                             16\n\fchildren and grandchildren; and that Isenberg feared and distrusted Debbie. The court\n\nalso heard testimony that there was much \u201cturmoil\u201d in Isenberg\u2019s family, and Isenberg\n\ndistrusted all of her children at various points in time. The allegedly disregarded\n\nevidence was at best cumulative to this testimony. Furthermore, Kitchen\u2019s expert\n\nwitness, Dr. Robert Sawicky, who opined that Isenberg was susceptible to undue\n\ninfluence, discussed the contents of Nelson\u2019s deposition testimony at some length.\n\n       It is highly unlikely that the day-in-the-life videotape or the two depositions would\n\nhave had any effect on the outcome, or would have caused the court to discredit Carlson\u2019s\n\ntestimony and deny the motion for judgment. Carlson\u2019s testimony, which the trial court\n\ncredited in its entirety, effectively sunk Kitchen\u2019s case. Because Kitchen has not\n\ndemonstrated a reasonable probability that the trial court\u2019s failure, if any, to review and\n\nconsider the day-in-the-life videotape, Isenberg\u2019s videotaped deposition, or Nelson\u2019s\n\ndeposition testimony before granting the motion for judgment affected the outcome, the\n\njudgment must be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f                                IV.

Kitchen challenged the validity of the last will and testament of\n\nher mother, Loree Isenberg, on the grounds Isenberg\u2019s signature on the April 12, 2002,\n\nwill was forged and, alternatively, the will was procured by means of undue influence\n\nand fraud on the part of Isenberg\u2019s oldest daughter, Deborah L. Collis (Debbie). The will\n\ndisinherited five of Isenberg\u2019s six adult children, including Kitchen, and left Isenberg\u2019s\n\nentire estate in equal shares to her brother, respondent Kenneth E. Foxford, and Debbie.\n\n       When Isenberg died on June 18, 2003, her principal asset was her interest in a $4.2\n\nmillion personal injury judgment which was on appeal. The judgment was affirmed on\n\nappeal in June 2004, and Debbie died in September 2004. A probate was not opened for\n\nthe will. In 2005, Kitchen filed the present petition seeking to invalidate the will and\n\ntransfer Isenberg\u2019s personal injury award and other assets to Kitchen on behalf of herself\n\nand Isenberg\u2019s other intestate heirs. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 850.)\n\n       After hearing evidence over six court days in May 2010, the trial court granted\n\nrespondents\u2019 motion for judgment and issued a statement of decision (Code Civ. Proc.,\n\n\u00a7 631.8),1 discrediting much of Kitchen\u2019s evidence and concluding she failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence to support her claims. Judgment was entered in favor of respondents\n\nand the proponents of the will, Kenneth E. Foxford and William Collis, Jr., the\n\nadministrator of Debbie\u2019s estate.\n\n\n       1 All further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless\notherwise indicated.\n\n                                             2\n\f       On this appeal, Kitchen claims the trial court violated section 631.8 and denied her\n\ndue process in granting the motion for judgment without first reviewing and considering\n\nthree items of evidence: (1) a \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d videotape showing Isenberg at home and\n\nin excruciating pain in May 2002; (2) Isenberg\u2019s videotaped deposition, taken in her\n\npersonal injury action in July 2002, showing her in poor health and having difficulties\n\nwith her memory; and (3) the deposition transcript of Isenberg\u2019s longtime friend, Mary\n\nNelson, taken in 2009 and attesting to Isenberg\u2019s abiding love for all of her children and\n\ngrandchildren, and her intent to share her personal injury award with all of them.\n\n       We affirm. The contents of the allegedly disregarded evidence, which was\n\nbrought to the court\u2019s attention before the court ruled on the motion, was largely\n\ncumulative to the testimony of other witnesses, and was referred to by other witnesses\n\nand counsel. In addition, the court credited the entire testimony of Isenberg\u2019s personal\n\ninjury attorney, Steven Carlson, who testified he prepared the will and discussed it at\n\nlength with Isenberg both before and at the time she signed it on April 12, 2002, at Kaiser\n\nHospital in Riverside in the presence of Carlson, another witness, and a notary public.\n\nAccording to Carlson, Debbie was not present when the will was signed, and Isenberg\n\nhad reasons for disinheriting five of her children, and she did not want her will discussed\n\nwith them.\n\n       The court concluded that even though Isenberg was susceptible to undue influence\n\nwhen she signed the will, the will was not the product of undue influence or fraud. We\n\ntherefore conclude that to the extent the court may have failed to view the day-in-the-life\n\n\n                                             3\n\fvideotape and deposition testimony, it is not reasonably probable Kitchen would have\n\nrealized a more favorable result had the court considered the evidence in detail. (Cal.\n\nConst., art. VI, \u00a7 13; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475.)\n\n                                   II. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Isenberg\u2019s Accident, Medical Condition, and Family Relationships\n\n       Isenberg died on June 18, 2003, at the age of 67. At the time she signed her will\n\non April 12, 2002, Isenberg was unmarried and had six adult children: Debbie, Mary K.\n\nWinkler (Kathy), Anthony Winkler, Jr. (Anthony), Jeffrey E. Winkler, Cynthia Babb, and\n\nKitchen. Kathy died in February 2003, predeceasing Isenberg. As noted, Debbie died in\n\nSeptember 2004.\n\n       On July 10, 2001, two years before her death, Isenberg suffered personal injuries,\n\nincluding blunt force trauma to the chest, when a car she was riding in was struck head-\n\non by an Anheuser-Busch beer truck. The driver of the car was killed, and Isenberg sued\n\nAnheuser-Busch, Inc. for her injuries. Isenberg was in poor health even before the\n\naccident: her pre-existing conditions included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\n\ncongestive heart failure, heart bypass surgery, insulin-dependent diabetes, and brain\n\natrophy. She was hospitalized for three days following the accident, then discharged to\n\nher home, but her condition quickly worsened.\n\n       In August 2001, a tracheotomy was performed to allow Isenberg to breathe\n\nthrough a ventilator, and she remained ventilator-dependent until February 2002.\n\nThereafter, she was periodically placed back on the ventilator and readmitted to various\n\n\n                                             4\n\fhospitals and a subacute care facility in Pomona known as Sunbridge. At home, she\n\nrequired 24-hour nursing care and a respiratory therapist.\n\n       Around February 2002, Debbie arranged for Isenberg to rent a trailer in Hemet, a\n\nshort walk from Debbie\u2019s trailer. Debbie spent many hours with Isenberg, both in\n\nIsenberg\u2019s trailer and when Isenberg was in the hospital and care facility, acting as\n\nIsenberg\u2019s self-appointed \u201cgatekeeper.\u201d Several of Isenberg\u2019s other adult children and\n\nher initial respiratory therapist, Dan Blair, testified Isenberg was fearful of Debbie, did\n\nnot trust Debbie, and did not want Debbie in charge of or making decisions concerning\n\nher estate. According to Babb, Debbie was always telling Isenberg about Debbie\u2019s\n\n\u201cproblems and [her] divorce,\u201d and this was stressful to Isenberg. According to Anthony,\n\nDebbie falsely told him she had a power of attorney for Isenberg, and the family had\n\nproblems with Debbie being \u201cdishonest and manipulative.\u201d\n\n       Additional testimony revealed that Debbie never interfered with Isenberg\u2019s\n\ncaretakers, never threatened to withhold food or medicine from Isenberg, and never\n\nprevented Isenberg\u2019s other children from visiting her outside Debbie\u2019s presence.\n\nAccording to Blair, Debbie only wanted to know what was going on with Isenberg, and\n\nIsenberg mistrusted and was frustrated with her entire family. Isenberg once told Blair\n\nshe wanted to leave her estate to him, and complained that her children never used to visit\n\nher but had been \u201caround her consistently\u201d since her accident. All of Isenberg\u2019s adult\n\nchildren who testified claimed they often visited Isenberg and had a good relationship\n\nwith her. An expert witness testified Isenberg was susceptible to undue influence, and\n\n\n                                              5\n\frelied in part on Nelson\u2019s 2009 deposition testimony that Isenberg loved all of her\n\nchildren and grandchildren and wanted to share her personal injury award with all of\n\nthem.\n\n        Kitchen testified that before the will was signed, Debbie told Kitchen that Debbie\n\nbelieved Isenberg wanted to establish a trust fund for her grandchildren. Kitchen and\n\nDebbie agreed Isenberg tended to favor the last child who visited her. According to\n\nKitchen, Debbie was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn that Foxford inherited half of Isenberg\u2019s estate.\n\nFoxford did not know he was a beneficiary of the will until after Isenberg died. Foxford\n\nalso testified there was \u201clots of turmoil\u201d in Isenberg\u2019s relationships with her children.\n\nPrior to the accident, Isenberg would be unhappy with one child one week and another\n\nchild the next.\n\nB. Carlson\u2019s Testimony and the Circumstances Surrounding the Will\n\n        Carlson prepared the will which Isenberg signed on April 12, 2002, in her room at\n\nKaiser Hospital in Riverside. On three or four occasions after February 2002, when she\n\nwas not on a ventilator, Isenberg told Carlson she wanted a will and wanted \u201cKenny [and]\n\nDebbie\u201d to inherit her estate. Carlson and a hospital security guard, Tim Bassin, who\n\nalso testified at trial, witnessed Isenberg sign the will and signed the will as witnesses. A\n\nnotary public also testified that she verified Isenberg\u2019s identity and witnessed her\n\nsignature. No one else was present when Isenberg signed the will. Carlson and Isenberg\n\nplanned on signing the will during the late morning when none of Isenberg\u2019s children,\n\nincluding Debbie, would be present.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f       Carlson read the will to Isenberg before she signed it, and Isenberg read the will\n\nherself. Isenberg\u2019s memory was good at the time; Carlson believed she had testamentary\n\ncapacity; and she never asked Carlson to change the will. According to Carlson, Isenberg\n\nhad problems with her children and reasons for disinheriting them; some owed her\n\nmoney; some had stolen from her; and some had had no contact with her. The children\u2019s\n\ntestimony showed Isenberg\u2019s beliefs were more or less true. For example, Anthony still\n\nowed Isenberg money. Isenberg instructed Carlson not to tell anyone about the will\n\nbecause it would cause conflicts in the family.\n\n       According to Carlson, Debbie was difficult and demanding on behalf of Isenberg;\n\nDebbie called Carlson\u2019s office almost daily, but she was not a \u201cbully.\u201d Isenberg was a\n\n\u201cnice lady,\u201d but also tough, strong-willed, and demanding. Preparing wills was\n\n\u201c[a]bsolutely not\u201d part of Carlson\u2019s law practice. Carlson had no notes concerning his\n\ndrafting of the will.\n\n       Around September 2001, when Carlson and his law partner Randy Johnson were\n\nfirst hired to represent Isenberg in her personal injury action, Isenberg had recently been\n\nin a coma and Johnson had another attorney draft conservatorship documents for\n\nIsenberg. But Isenberg later \u201ccame around\u201d and was \u201cdoing a lot better,\u201d and made it\n\nclear she did not want a conservator.\n\nC. Isenberg\u2019s Personal Injury Award and Judgment\n\n       In January 2003, a jury awarded Isenberg $4,256,385 in her personal injury action\n\nagainst Anheuser-Busch, Inc. The award was comprised of $3,026,385 for past and\n\n\n                                             7\n\ffuture medical expenses and $1,230,000 for pain and suffering. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.\n\nappealed. After Isenberg died in June 2003, no probate estate was opened for Isenberg.\n\nFoxford and Debbie substituted into the personal injury action as Isenberg\u2019s successors in\n\ninterest.\n\n       In June 2004, the personal injury judgment was affirmed on appeal.2 Debbie died\n\nin September 2004, survived by her two children, William Collis, Jr. and Nicole Weaver.\n\nRespondent William Collis, Jr. is the administrator of Debbie\u2019s estate. In her petition,\n\nKitchen alleges Anheuser-Busch, Inc. paid the judgment to Isenberg\u2019s personal injury\n\nattorneys, Carlson and Johnson. The attorneys, in turn, bypassed opening a probate or\n\nintestate estate for Isenberg, bypassed paying any creditors, and distributed\n\n$2,366,788.30 to themselves for their attorney fees; $998,121.71 to Foxford, and\n\n$973,766.71 to Debbie\u2019s estate.\n\nD. The Motion for Judgment and Statement of Decision\n\n       In her petition and at trial, Kitchen claimed Isenberg\u2019s signature on the will was\n\nforged and Debbie procured the will by means of undue influence. The petition asserted\n\nclaims of forgery, lack of due execution, lack of capacity, undue influence, fraud,\n\ncoercion, duress, menace, negligence, fraud and concealment, conversion, and\n\nconstructive trust against respondents.\n\n\n\n\n       2Debbie L. Collis v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (June 7, 2004, E033292) [Fourth Dist.,\nDiv. Two; nonpub. opn.].\n\n                                             8\n\f       On the morning of May 26, 2010, near the close of Kitchen\u2019s evidence, the court\n\nsuggested that respondents file a motion for judgment on the ground Kitchen did not\n\npresent sufficient evidence to support her claims. (\u00a7 638.1.) That same morning, the\n\ncourt admitted the three items of evidence Kitchen claims the court failed to consider\n\nbefore it ruled on the motion shortly after 1:30 p.m. that afternoon: (1) Isenberg\u2019s six-\n\nminute \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d videotape taken in May 2002, shortly after she signed the will;\n\n(2) Isenberg\u2019s 40-minute videotaped deposition taken in July 2002; and (3) the 167-page\n\ndeposition transcript of Nelson taken in 2009.\n\n       In granting the motion, the court explained its findings in detail, and recorded its\n\nfindings in its statement of decision. The court found the will was duly executed and\n\nwitnessed and there was no evidence it was procured by undue influence, fraud, coercion,\n\nduress, or menace. The court credited the testimony of Carlson, the other witness to the\n\nwill, and the notary public, and discredited the testimony of Kitchen\u2019s handwriting expert\n\nwho testified Isenberg\u2019s signature appeared to be forged. The court found Isenberg\u2019s\n\nsignature on the will was genuine.\n\n       The court found Kitchen did not establish a prima facie case or presumption of\n\nundue influence sufficient to shift the burden to respondents to prove the will was not the\n\nresult of undue influence. The three elements necessary to establish the presumption had\n\nnot been met: (1) there was no confidential relationship between Isenberg and either\n\nFoxford or Debbie; (2) neither Foxford nor Debbie actively participated in the\n\npreparation or execution of the will; and (3) there was no undue benefit to Foxford or\n\n\n                                              9\n\fDebbie because the disposition, though \u201csomewhat unusual,\u201d was \u201cwithin the realm of\n\nreasonableness\u201d and, as such, was insufficient to support a presumption of undue\n\ninfluence. The court also found Isenberg was \u201csusceptible to undue influence,\u201d but the\n\n\u201cevidence taken as a whole did not establish that the Will was procured as a result of that\n\nsusceptibility to undue influence . . . .\u201c\n\n                                      III. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Section 631.8 and the Standard of Review\n\n       After a party has completed presenting its evidence in a nonjury trial, other parties\n\nmay move for a judgment and statement of decision without waiving their right to present\n\ndefense or rebuttal evidence. (\u00a7 631.8, subd. (a).)3 The motion claims the party against\n\nwhom it is made presented insufficient evidence to sustain that party\u2019s burden of proof.\n\n(Combs v. Skyriver Communications, Inc. (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1242, 1262-1263.) If\n\nthe motion has merit, it dispenses with the need for the moving party to present evidence.\n\n(Roth v. Parker (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 542, 549.) As Kitchen emphasizes, the court is\n\nrequired to weigh all the evidence submitted by the nonmoving party in ruling on a\n\nmotion for judgment. (County of Contra Costa v. Humore, Inc. (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th\n\n1335, 1344.)\n\n       3 Section 631.8, subdivision (a) provides, in relevant part: \u201cAfter a party has\ncompleted his presentation of evidence in a trial by the court, the other party, without\nwaiving his right to offer evidence in support of his defense or in rebuttal in the event the\nmotion is not granted, may move for a judgment. The court as trier of the facts shall\nweigh the evidence and may render a judgment in favor of the moving party, in which\ncase the court shall make a statement of decision as provided in Sections 632 and 634\n. . . .\u201d\n\n                                             10\n\f       Because section 631.8 requires the court to \u201cweigh the evidence\u201d in ruling on a\n\nmotion for judgment, the court may discredit some testimony, credit other testimony, and\n\ndraw conclusions contrary to expert opinion. (Roth v. Parker, supra, 57 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n550; Jordan v. City of Santa Barbara (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1245, 1255.) We apply the\n\nsubstantial evidence standard of review to a judgment entered pursuant to section 631.8.\n\n(Combs v. Skyriver Communications, Inc., supra, 159 Cal.App.4th at p. 1263.) We\n\nreview the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment and draw all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the party prevailing on the motion. (Ibid.) We will not\n\nreverse the judgment if substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings.\n\n(Roth v. Parker, supra, at pp. 549-550.)\n\nB. Undue Influence\n\n       \u201c\u2018As a general proposition, California law allows a testator to dispose of property\n\nas he or she sees fit without regard to whether the dispositions specified are appropriate\n\nor fair. [Citations.] Testamentary competence is presumed. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d\n\n(Hagen v. Hickenbottom (1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 168, 181.) But a will is subject to being\n\ninvalidated and set aside if it was procured as a result of undue influence. (Rice v. Clark\n\n(2002) 28 Cal.4th 89, 96; David v. Hermann (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 672, 684.) Proof of\n\nundue influence overcomes the presumption of testamentary competence. (Hagen v.\n\nHickenbottom, supra, at pp. 181-182.)\n\n       \u201cUndue influence is pressure brought to bear directly on the testamentary act,\n\nsufficient to overcome the testator\u2019s free will, amounting in effect to coercion destroying\n\n\n                                             11\n\fthe testator\u2019s free agency.\u201d (Rice v. Clark, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 96, italics added; see\n\nalso David v. Hermann, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 684.) Undue influence is subject to\n\nstrict rules of proof, reflecting the strength of the presumption in favor of the will or other\n\ntestamentary instrument and the testator\u2019s competence or testamentary capacity: To\n\nprove undue influence, it is must be shown that \u201c\u2018\u201cthe influence was such as, in effect, to\n\ndestroy the testator\u2019s free agency and substitute for his own another person\u2019s will.\n\n[Citation.] Evidence must be produced that pressure was brought to bear directly upon\n\nthe testamentary act. [Citation.] Mere general influence, however strong and controlling,\n\nnot brought to bear upon the testamentary act, is not enough; it must be influence used\n\ndirectly to procure the will and must amount to coercion destroying free agency on the\n\npart of the testator. [Citation.] . . . [M]ere opportunity to influence the mind of the\n\ntestator, even coupled with an interest or a motive to do so, is not sufficient. [Citation.]\n\n. . .\u201d\u2019\u201d (Hagen v. Hickenbottom, supra, 41 Cal.App.4th at p. 182.)\n\n       Undue influence may be proved by circumstantial evidence. (David v. Hermann,\n\nsupra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 684.) \u201cThe proof of undue influence by circumstantial\n\nevidence usually requires a showing of a number of factors that, in combination, justify\n\nthe inference, but which, taken individually and alone, are not sufficient.\u201d (14 Witkin,\n\nSummary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Wills and Probate, \u00a7 132, p. 195.) Indicia of\n\nundue influence include: \u201c(1) The provisions of the will were unnatural. It cut off from\n\nany substantial bequests the natural objects of the decedent\u2019s bounty; (2) the dispositions\n\nof the will were at variance with the intentions of the decedent, expressed both before and\n\n\n                                              12\n\fafter its execution; (3) the relations existing between the chief beneficiaries and the\n\ndecedent afforded to the former an opportunity to control the testamentary act; (4) the\n\ndecedent\u2019s mental and physical condition was such as to permit a subversion of his\n\nfreedom of will [the decedent was susceptible to undue influence]; and (5) the chief\n\nbeneficiaries under the will were active in procuring the instrument to be executed.\u201d\n\n(Estate of Yale (1931) 214 Cal. 115, 122; see also Estate of Ventura (1963) 217\n\nCal.App.2d 50, 59-60.)\n\n       Ordinarily, the person challenging the will has the burden of proving undue\n\ninfluence. (David v. Hermann, supra, 129 Cal.App.4th at p. 684.) But a presumption of\n\nundue influence \u201c\u2018arises upon the challenger\u2019s showing that (1) the person alleged to\n\nhave exerted undue influence had a confidential relationship with the testator; (2) the\n\nperson actively participated in procuring the instrument\u2019s preparation or execution; and\n\n(3) the person would benefit unduly by the testamentary instrument.\u2019\u201d (Ibid.) When the\n\nchallenger establishes these three factors, the burden shifts to the proponent of the will or\n\nother testamentary instrument to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\ninstrument was not procured by undue influence. (Ibid.)\n\nC. Analysis\n\n       Kitchen does not claim she presented a prima facie case or sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport a presumption of undue influence, and as indicated the trial court found she did\n\nnot meet this burden. Instead, she claims the court violated section 631.8 and her due\n\nprocess rights in failing to consider all of the evidence of undue influence before ruling\n\n\n                                             13\n\fon the motion for judgment, specifically: (1) Isenberg\u2019s six-minute \u201cday-in-the-life\u201d\n\nvideotape taken in May 2002; (2) Isenberg\u2019s 40-minute videotaped deposition taken in\n\nJuly 2002; and (3) Nelson\u2019s deposition testimony. She suggests that, had the court\n\nreviewed these items of evidence, it could have found she presented sufficient indicia of\n\nundue influence to meet her burden of proof on this claim.\n\n       It is unclear whether the court had a DVD player and monitor or similar equipment\n\nto view the two DVD\u2019s. In any event, it appears the court may not have had a chance to\n\nview the DVD\u2019s or read Nelson\u2019s deposition, over the lunch hour, before it granted the\n\nmotion shortly after 1:30 p.m. on May 26. Kitchen claims the court\u2019s failure to consider\n\nthe three items of evidence admitted earlier during the day requires reversal of the\n\njudgment and remand for a new trial. We disagree.\n\n       The court\u2019s alleged error in disregarding the proffered evidence is identical in\n\neffect to the erroneous exclusion of admissible evidence. Such error requires reversal\n\n\u201conly if the reviewing court is of the opinion, after examining the entire record, that it is\n\n[reasonably] probable that a result more favorable to appellants would have been reached\n\nabsent the error. [Citation.]\u201d (Lunghi v. Clark Equipment Co. (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d\n\n485, 489; see Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 475; Evid. Code, \u00a7 354.)\n\n       Assuming the court did not view or consider the three items of evidence before it\n\ngranted the motion for judgment, the error was harmless to Kitchen. In view of all of the\n\nother evidence presented and the trial court\u2019s findings, it is not reasonably probable that\n\nthe court would have concluded that Kitchen presented sufficient indicia of undue\n\n\n                                              14\n\finfluence, or sufficient evidence to support her other claims, including fraud, had the\n\ncourt considered the allegedly disregarded evidence in detail.\n\n       The May 2002 day-in-the-life videotape of Isenberg, which was made for purposes\n\nof settlement in the personal injury action, shows Isenberg in her home, in excruciating\n\npain, and somewhat dependent on Debbie, but a nurse was tending to Isenberg\u2019s needs.\n\nIn the videotape, Isenberg is not on a ventilator, communicates well with Debbie and the\n\nnurse, and appears well aware of what is going on around her.\n\n       Isenberg\u2019s July 2002 videotaped deposition shows her having difficulty breathing,\n\nbut not on a ventilator, and having some difficulty recalling people, events, and other\n\nthings. For example, Isenberg at one point referred to \u201cKathy Collis\u201d but when prompted\n\nclarified she meant Debbie Collis. She appeared confused and said she did not know,\n\nwhen asked, what diabetes was, nor did she know whether she took insulin. But she\n\nrecalled breaking her hip around 1990; having heart surgery in 1999; and that she used to\n\nsmoke cigarettes \u201ca lot.\u201d She recalled she was coming from home and going to her\n\ndoctor\u2019s office in Hemet when the July 2001 accident occurred. She recalled shattering\n\nglass and being helped from the car by responders. She lived in Lake Elsinore before the\n\naccident but now lived alone in Hemet. She described her present pain and discomforts\n\nand recalled she had seven (not six) living children. Before the accident, she was on\n\nsocial security disability but could drive herself to the market. In short, the videotaped\n\ndeposition does not show Isenberg having significant memory lapses or not\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\funderstanding what was happening around her. She graciously thanked all of the\n\nattorneys at the end of the deposition.\n\n       In her 2009 deposition, Nelson described how she befriended Isenberg around\n\n1965, shortly after Isenberg\u2019s seventh child Sean died in his infancy, and had kept in\n\ntouch with Isenberg over the years. Nelson described how Isenberg loved all of her\n\nchildren and grandchildren. According to Nelson, before the accident Isenberg told\n\nNelson she wanted her youngest child, Kitchen, to inherit her \u201cpersonal stuff\u201d because\n\nshe wanted to \u201cmake up\u201d to Kitchen for leaving her and the other children\u2019s father when\n\nKitchen was very young. After the accident, Isenberg said she wanted to give \u201cthe little\n\nthings\u201d to her granddaughters.\n\n       Nelson also testified that Isenberg did not recall her children visiting her after the\n\naccident and believed they had not visited her in a long time. Around July 2002, Isenberg\n\nwas upset because she believed Debbie had lied about the other children not visiting her.\n\nIsenberg also told Nelson that Debbie had \u201cstolen\u201d some of her medications and money\n\nand she did not trust Debbie. Nelson believed Kitchen was the only child whom Isenberg\n\ntrusted. Isenberg wanted to purchase a large estate with her personal injury award and\n\nhave all of her children and grandchildren there. Isenberg \u201cwanted to do for all\u201d of her\n\nchildren and never told Nelson she wanted to disinherit any of her children.\n\n       Apart from the day-in-the-life videotape and the two depositions, the trial court\n\nheard ample testimony from other witnesses that Isenberg was in poor health and in a\n\nfragile mental state around the time she signed the will; that Isenberg loved all of her\n\n\n                                             16\n\fchildren and grandchildren; and that Isenberg feared and distrusted Debbie. The court\n\nalso heard testimony that there was much \u201cturmoil\u201d in Isenberg\u2019s family, and Isenberg\n\ndistrusted all of her children at various points in time. The allegedly disregarded\n\nevidence was at best cumulative to this testimony. Furthermore, Kitchen\u2019s expert\n\nwitness, Dr. Robert Sawicky, who opined that Isenberg was susceptible to undue\n\ninfluence, discussed the contents of Nelson\u2019s deposition testimony at some length.\n\n       It is highly unlikely that the day-in-the-life videotape or the two depositions would\n\nhave had any effect on the outcome, or would have caused the court to discredit Carlson\u2019s\n\ntestimony and deny the motion for judgment. Carlson\u2019s testimony, which the trial court\n\ncredited in its entirety, effectively sunk Kitchen\u2019s case. Because Kitchen has not\n\ndemonstrated a reasonable probability that the trial court\u2019s failure, if any, to review and\n\nconsider the day-in-the-life videotape, Isenberg\u2019s videotaped deposition, or Nelson\u2019s\n\ndeposition testimony before granting the motion for judgment affected the outcome, the\n\njudgment must be affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f                                IV.
